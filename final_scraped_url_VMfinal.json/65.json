It cited the impact being in a Netflix production had on actors that were previously little known.", "For example, over 20 million-member households around the world watched the Netflix Spanish original Elite.", "One of its stars, Ester Exposito, had just 30,000 Instagram followers before the launch of the show on September 28th, 2018.", "Mr. Sarandos continued to beat the drum of the power of Netflix, citing the success of the Netflix Original movie Birdbox with Sandra Bullock:", "“What does it mean when 80 million households watch Birdbox? Culturally, it means exactly the same thing as 80 million plus people buying a movie ticket to see it or 80 million households watching a TV show.”", "However, it has been a long time since scripted television delivered audiences of 80 million. Peak TV shows recently have driven audiences that are only a fraction of the size of the top shows in the ‘70s and ‘80s.", "However, Mr. Sarandos could have a point. Maybe peak viewing – or at least big audiences – have transferred to online service like Netflix.", "“For part of your Netflix subscription, you’re in the zeitgeist. You’re watching what the rest of the world is loving at the same time.”", "Netflix shows no sign in letting up on its massive spending on content. With Disney and WarnerMedia entering the market at the end of the year, now is not the time to be trimming spending.", "Moreover, while the spending keeps delivering 26% growth in paying customers, there is no reason to stop.", "One area where the company is increasing spending is in co-production partnerships with local broadcasters.", "Mr. Sarandos said that last year 140 shows premiered in a local market with a local producer and premiered on Netflix in the rest of the world.", "The number of shows like that will grow to 180 in 2019. As an example, he mentioned The Bodyguard, a partnership with ITV and BBC in the UK.", "The show premiered on British TV on BBC One and released as a Netflix Original Series at the same time in the rest of the world.", "Star Trek: Discovery is another example. It premiered in the U.S. on CBS All Access and in the rest of the world as a Netflix Original Series.", "The company is also seeing success with unscripted shows like Tidying Up Marie Kondo. Reed Hastings, Netflix CEO said:", "“In unscripted, the majority of viewing is branded original.”", "All of this means Netflix subscribers will continue to find plenty of new original shows for at least the next year or so.", "Netflix continues to grow strongly, even in mature markets like the U.S.", "The growth is due in large part to the huge amount the company is spending on content.", "The company went to great pains to emphasize it is spending its money wisely."]}

There are a multitude of articles parroting off each other; effectively saying “the British are Coming.”", "According to them, Netflix is over leveraged and either competition, or free cash flow burn will tear down Netflix’s moat.", "This article’s goal is to put Netflix’s Competition, and Credit Risk into perspective. As a background, I spent over two decades as an industry and credit analyst.", "My passion is understanding how new technologies are disrupting industries. Here in San Francisco, it’s a living breathing thing that presents itself as soon as you leave your front door, tripping over a Lime scooter on your way to meet your Uber driver.", "Let’s start with the right-brain qualitative stuff. Over the last decade, competition in Media & Telecom has decreased markedly.", "Market share is often dominated by just a half-dozen players. The result has been lower competition and an oligopolistic industry structure, according to Harold Vogel, who’s written the bible on the subject.", "One reason for this is globalization. There is no way a small steel mill can compete with a Chinese steel multinational which has operations near its customers and benefits from economies of scale.", "Other reasons are regulatory (e.g., lack of anti-trust enforcement). For more information, I recommend the book The Myth of Capitalism.", "The wireless carrier market share chart below (data from Statista) shows that 72% of share is dominated by just two carriers and T-Mobile/Sprint are presently arguing with regulators that their proposed merger won’t raise prices.", "AT&T itself recently merged with Time Warner. Consolidation isn’t just between companies within the same segment but vertically between sectors (wireless, landline, CATV, Film Studios, etc.)", "Certain industries, such as Media, Telecommunications & Technology are prone to oligopolistic behavior due to their implicit network effects.", "Investors are now fearing the onslaught of new streaming competitors. However, time will settle and we will likely be left with just 3-4 providers: Netflix, Disney, Amazon and a fourth that is to be determined.", "Think of these streamers as those 850lb Sea Lions on Pier 39. Every once in a while these pinnipeds bark loudly as they defend and adjust their space.", "The Statista table below is the market share for video subscriptions (i.e., streamers). Disney already doubled its stake in Hulu to 60% via its 21st Century acquisition and they will likely negotiate to buy the rest from AT&T/Time Warner and Comcast (owns via NBCUniversal).", "Meanwhile, AT&T has already made moves to consolidate HBO Now/Direct TV with the Turner networks (CNN, TBS, etc...) which may result in an internal culture clash.", "As we wait for the industry’s dust to settle, the more entertaining question is, “What is Netflix’s actual credit risk?”", "While credit analysis involves several factors, my focus will be to examine debt repayment ability. For that, we need to examine cash flow – a term that means different things to different people.", "When I reviewed leveraged finance credits, cash flow usually meant EBITDA. Because it is an earnings-based measure, EBITDA won’t be able to tell you if the borrower is using aggressive accounting tactics.", "Another version widely used is Operating Cash Flow (OCF) that can easily be found in a Form-10K, according to the SFAS 95 reporting standard.", "SFAS 95 took years in the making (mandated in 1987) which recalls the phrase, “You can please some of the people all of the time…”", "Since SFAS 95 wasn’t sufficient for the film industry, the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants issued Statement of Position No-00-2 (in 2000) which was later codified into ASC-926 and ASC-920.", "This accounting standard essentially says that film costs need to be capitalized and those costs need to be presented in the Operating Cash Flow (OCF) section of a company’s cash flow statement.", "So costs that are most always classified as capital expenditures under the Investing section of the cash flow statement are moved to the Operating section.", "This makes Netflix’s OCF appear much worse than convention. Furthermore, Netflix started shifting from licensing others’ content to producing its own original content which effectively shifts its returns on investment to outer periods.", "Concurrently, the majority of spending is shifting to its international business, which in effect, is like starting a new company – investments are to be expected.", "Netflix is far outspending its peers in terms of content spending over its revenue base. While high on an absolute basis, management has indicated its originals avoid a 30-50% markup by producing in-house.", "The table below shows Netflix’s last three years of operating cash flow and how the inclusion of “Additions to streaming content assets” sharply reduces cash flow.", "The company then calculates Non-GAAP free cash flow as a $3Bn deficit by adding the purchases of Property and DVD content (these are shown in purple).", "A few months back, I met a hedge fund manager at a CFA Society conference that was adamant to the point of anger that Netflix was “going down” because of irresponsible content spending.", "So I started reading every article on the video streamer. “Was I missing something?” I thought. What I discovered was a cognitive dissonance – perhaps intellectual laziness.", "Macho manager was saying that Netflix’s $3Bn Operating Cash Flow(OCF) and Free Cash Flow (FCF) burn would eventually turn the borrower insolvent.", "And superficially, he seemed correct given that Netflix is saddled with $10.3Bn in debt and just $2.1Bn in EBITDA (see below).", "There is no GAAP mandate requiring companies to disclose free cash flow. However, any time a company reports a non-GAAP performance indicator such as EBITDA, it is required to show a reconciliation between that pro-forma number and the GAAP number.", "Below is Adjusted EBITDA as reported by Netflix for the 2018 period and its reconciliation with GAAP Net Income.", "While Netflix reports a conservative OCF, note that it also reports a very conservative Adjusted EBITDA number of $2.1Bn for 2018.", "EBITDA is typically calculated by taking Operating Income, or EBIT and adding Depreciation and Amortization.", "In this case, Netflix does not include any of the $7.5Bn in Amortization from its content production.", "Including Amortization uplifts EBITDA to $9.7Bn (see table below). It is unclear why the company does not separately report Amortization on its income statement as the dollar amount comprises 76% of its cost of goods sold.", "Remember, EBITDA is mostly derived from the income statement.", "Nonetheless, it is clear Netflix’s credit quality is better than the Ba3/BB- assigned by the credit rating agencies on 10/2018.", "Based on its credit metrics, the borrower should be rated BB+ given its strong business position, moderate financial leverage and high equity market cap (the company can issue shares to repay debt).", "My BB+ rating mapping considers that Netflix will need to borrow an additional $3Bn to fund film production.", "The table below shows that Netflix’s Net Debt/Adjusted EBITDA approximates 3x, a level that credit rating agencies assign investment-grade ratings to.", "If Amortization is added into EBITDA, Net Debt leverage falls to just 0.68x (A rating category). That rating would then have to be notched down based on the company’s negative cash flow and Content Obligations.", "About $8.6Bn are due this year (listed on the balance sheet) with the remainder 3-5 years (Off-Balance Sheet).", "Management has not provided detail on these contracts or how flexible they are to renegotiation.", "So what’s Netflix worth? An adequate valuation of Netflix would entail using several valuation measures which is out of the scope of this article.", "Below are the inputs of a Discounted Free Cash Flow (DCF) model that applies my belief that the company’s operating leverage is high.", "I expect FCF to turn sharply positive within the next few years. I project reasonable revenue growth based on historical trends, then forecast FCF to reach a limit of 33% of Netflix’s revenue base.", "This percentage is based on a peer group of media companies as well as software firms. The WACC (weighted average cost of capital of 10.4%) used to discount the FCF is higher than average (more conservative) to reflect the stock’s high beta.", "Terminal growth is 3% and FCF is projected to rise quickly beginning in 2022. Year 1 is 2019E, etc. Under those assumptions, the DCF calculated a stock value of $400/share which is about 10% above the current trading level.", "The difference is not significant given the high margin of error.", "Another technique supporting my strong FCF expectation is by examining what other film production companies spent in the past.", "I sampled three types of companies (independent, conglomerate, animation). It’s important to include Pixar and Dreamworks as they were known for “betting the farm” on a new medium called computer-animation.", "As of 2018, Netflix spent 82.6% of revenues on Content Production. If we apply the median Content Production/Revenues of 33.8% onto Netflix’s $15.8Bn in revenues, then Netflix would have easily eliminated its $3Bn FCF deficit in 2018.", "Future profitability can also be forecasted by applying the contribution margin for the Domestic Segment (34%) or DVD segment (58%) onto the International segment.", "The boldfaced line (“Potential”) below shows that Contribution Profit rises from $3.46Bn to $5.34Bn in 2018.", "This equates to a 118% increase in Netflix’s overall operating income, to $3.5Bn and covers over half of the operating cash flow deficit.", "While using a DCF model to determine Netflix’s share value is a factor, basing a purchase decision on it is foolhardy.", "That is because the majority of Netflix’s cash flows are in the distant future. Consequently, minor changes to cash flows, WACC or long-term growth will have a dramatic effect on the calculated value.", "Perhaps a better way would be to use Enterprise Value/Revenues, which was 10.8x (FY’2018) and 8x on a forward basis.", "Both are high but nothing out of the ballpark. Either way, it is clear that Netflix will have high cash flows once the industry resettles and the International segment matures.", "Oh, and one more thing. To that macho Hedge Fund guy shorting Netflix, I wish you the best of luck – you’ll need it!", "28 years working with high and ultra-net-worth individuals and family offices. Expert in capital raising.", "5yNice analysis Dom, very thorough! I still dislike Netflix because they never have the movie I am looking for."]}

But once that content exists on Netflix’s platform, those shows and movies become evergreen content for Netflix to attract new customers and retain existing ones around the world.", "It’s difficult to overstate just how pivotal House of Cards was for Netflix. For one, the show introduced subscribers to the concept of Netflix Originals, which told viewers they could expect to see more exciting, new, and original programming on Netflix in the future.", "However, Netflix wasn’t producing original content for its own sake or to pad out its catalog. Netflix was laser-focused on producing not only original programming but content that was as good—if not better—than the best shows on network TV.", "Another factor that distinguished House of Cards from rival cable and network shows was the series’ budget.", "Boasting a production budget of $100M, House of Cards‘ budget was vast for an as-yet unproven show and virtually unprecedented for a non-HBO television production.", "Throwing so much money at its first real foray into original programming was seen as a gamble for Netflix, but it also demonstrated the company’s commitment to producing top-notch programming from the outset.", "Something else that helped House of Cards stand out was the impressive roster of creative talent behind the show.", "Hollywood heavyweights including director David Fincher (Fight Club, The Social Network) and actor Kevin Spacey were both attached to the series, lending the new show some much-needed celebrity star power.", "The real genius of House of Cards wasn’t the show’s budget or the Hollywood names behind the project, however, but in how the show was released.", "By releasing every episode of the show’s first season simultaneously, Netflix introduced audiences to the concept of “binge-watching,” a development that would fundamentally change the way we watch TV.", "This wasn’t a marketing ploy or mere gimmick—Netflix wanted to deliver a better experience to subscribers.", "Who wants to wait a whole week to see how last week’s cliffhanger concludes, or suffer through 20 minutes of advertising for a 40-minute show?", "Of course, Netflix wanted to change the way we watched TV everywhere, not just in the United States. If streaming video on the internet was Netflix’s most prescient business decision, the company’s overnight expansion around the world was the most ambitious.", "The sheer scale of Netflix’s international expansion would have given other companies pause, but Netflix had been busily readying itself for global domination for more than two years.", "To find new subscribers in overseas markets, Netflix established agreements with cellular and cable network operators in each regional market.", "Although these agreements took months or even years to finalize, they were mutually beneficial. Netflix gained millions of new subscribers in overseas markets almost instantly with no need for international advertising campaigns or licensing agreements, and cellular providers gained a competitive advantage over domestic competitors by bundling Netflix into their plans.", "With more subscribers comes more revenue, which can then be invested back into original content—the same virtuous cycle of constant growth we identified earlier.", "Netflix’s approach to its international expansion is another great example of how the company has continually built upon its previous successes.", "Netflix had been bartering with media publishers abroad for years; the company’s new allegiances with foreign cellular and cable companies was merely a new way to broker similar deals.", "Netflix’s overseas expansion also laid the foundation for much of the original foreign programming that has proven popular with English-speaking audiences, such as German science-fiction drama Dark, Japanese reality TV franchise Terrace House, and Swedish detective procedural Wallander.", "Of all the milestones Netflix has reached, eclipsing the total number of cable subscribers in America was an amazing achievement.", "Not only did Netflix go from being an upstart DVD rental business to one of the largest entertainment production companies in the world in less than 20 years, it also managed to consistently innovate in verticals that many analysts and experts deemed impenetrable before Netflix muscled its way in.", "With Netflix’s credentials as a serious player in TV and feature-film production well established, Netflix seems poised for even greater success in 2018 and beyond.", "Predictably, Netflix remains strongly committed to producing original programming, and the company is reportedly planning to produce around 700 Netflix Originals in 2018 alone, having increased its content budget from $6B to $8B.", "Competition from rivals including Amazon and Hulu will likely intensify in the coming years, but Netflix still has plenty of options:", "It’s practically impossible to speculate about the future of home entertainment—and, by extension, the future of Netflix – without talking about augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR).", "Netflix’s CEO Reed Hastings has been vocally skeptical about AR and VR in the past. Hastings believes that VR is particularly ill-suited to TV and film because binge-watching is a lot more difficult due to the physical sensations that make VR so immersive.", "(If you’ve used a VR headset, you’ll know what he’s talking about.) However, with Amazon, Hulu, and other content providers betting big on AR and VR, Netflix may have little choice but to embrace these emerging technologies if it wants to retain its crown as the king of home entertainment.", "“We’re experimenting with things, we’re looking at things, but we have no concrete plans. It’s a very early phase, so we’re gonna learn some things with no commitment other than to have the Netflix TV shows and movies be available within the headsets.”", "Currently, Netflix uses the data it knows about us to optimize which shows we’re shown in our discovery queues.", "However, with so much data at its disposal, Netflix is uniquely positioned to produce substantially better programming using this same data.", "With all of the data Netflix has about us and the shows we watch, Netflix isn’t just equipped to get people to watch more shows but to actually make better shows.", "A more data-centric approach to TV production could be one area of growth we may see as competition for audiences intensifies in the coming years.", "Media consolidation is one of the single most important trends in entertainment today. With several mega-mergers fundamentally reshaping the media landscape in North America and around the world, Netflix may find itself negotiating strategic acquisitions of major media publishers to acquire existing intellectual properties, broadcast rights, and service providers.", "For example, Disney’s acquisition of 21st Century Fox, a deal that will see Disney assume indirect ownership of Netflix rival Hulu, may force Netflix to look beyond its own backyard so that the company can effectively preempt competing programming.", "There have already been signs that Netflix is becoming more open to the idea of strategic acquisitions.", "Netflix made its first acquisition in August 2017 when the company paid an undisclosed sum as part of a “small deal” for British comic-book publisher Millarworld.", "It’s been a wild ride for Netflix over the past two decades. What can we learn from the company’s journey?", "1. Identify the one metric that can grow with your business", "It’s no secret that most new businesses fail. Some companies don’t make it because they take too many risks, but just as many fail because they don’t aim high enough.", "In the early days of your business, it’s crucial to identify a massive potential market that you can grow into.", "Google may be one of the biggest technology companies in the world, but it still cares about how many searches are conducted every month.", "Facebook may have 2 billion users, but it has always cared how active those users are, and how it can maximize engagement of those active users.", "One of the best ways to identify the core growth metric that will grow with your business is to examine the usage data that you already have.", "You want to find levers that will allow you to increase product usage and retention. Early on, your North Star metric can be as simple as increasing your total active user base.", "Later on, you’ll want to identify specific actions users take that correlate with long-term retention.", "It’s vital that everybody in your company is on the same page regarding your growth metric. Devising technical goals around your core metric is practically impossible if data is only available to a handful of people.", "Once you’ve identified your core growth metric, make all data surrounding this metric (and associated goals) available to everybody, from your engineers to your customer success reps.", "Once you’ve identified your core growth metric, it’s time to think about the goals associated with that metric.", "In the early days of its growth, Dropbox measured its success by how many users actually placed at least one file into storage.", "Similarly, Slack focused on getting companies to send at least 2,000 messages because that was the point at which Slack users really began to understand the benefits of the platform.", "How are you driving growth around your core metric?", "Just because people expect your business to do something doesn’t mean it’s the wrong thing to do.", "Not every idea has to reinvent the wheel. The best decisions are the ones that help your business grow, not the ones that only keep your competitors on their toes.", "Just as the simplest explanations are often the best explanations, sometimes the most obvious moves are the ones your business must make if you want to survive.", "However, that’s not to say that the best moves are always obvious. In Netflix’s case, the decision to start streaming video via the internet was, in hindsight, almost painfully obvious.", "But at the time, Hastings’ decision cast doubt on both his leadership and the company’s future. Imagine if Hastings had listened to the naysayers who thought streaming was nothing more than a fad.", "If your company is at a critical growth stage, think about:", "- How to solve your customers’ problems and make their lives easier. Very few people use products for the sake of using them.", "People use products to solve their problems and make their lives better. To help your customers, ask yourself one simple question: “How am I making my customers’ lives easier with my product?”", "- How to improve your product. It’s all too easy to become married to unpopular features simply because of how long they took to develop – a classic example of the sunk cost fallacy.", "If a product feature is unpopular with your user base or going unused by a majority of your users, pruning it is an obvious move.", "It’s also the right move. It’s more important to keep your customers happy than it is to keep your competitors guessing.", "- How to solve the hardest problems, not the most interesting problems. The most interesting challenges facing your engineers may not necessarily be the most urgent problems facing your users.", "It’s crucial to remain focused on the most difficult problems your product aims to tackle rather than the problems your engineers find the most interesting.", "The hardest problems may not be as exciting to solve but doing so will make your customers love your product, which will drive growth.", "Netflix has always focused on doing whatever it does really well, whether that meant getting members’ DVDs to them faster or developing new streaming technologies.", "This dedication to quality – whether it be the quality of the Netflix experience or the quality of its content – is what has helped Netflix cultivate not only a vast subscriber base but a loyal audience of fans.", "Although there are exceptions, it’s generally safe to assume that the higher the quality of your product or service, the higher your costs will be.", "However, depending on how competitive your vertical is, the question may not be whether you can afford to make a higher-quality product but whether you can afford not to.", "When it comes to the quality of your product, ask yourself some tough questions:", "- Did you cut corners or otherwise compromise on product quality in your race to reach product-market fit faster?", "If so, what would you do differently if you had more time? Moving fast is great, but breaking things all the time isn’t.", "- Looking at competing products in your vertical, do any of your competitors offer a feature or function that’s as good or better than yours?", "In what ways is it better? What could you improve about your product to gain a competitive edge?", "- Let’s say your product itself is as good as it possibly can be at this point. How’s your customer support?", "What about onboarding? Or your product documentation or learning resources? Remember – product quality isn’t just about how good your product is, it’s about how well you help your customers do what they want to do.", "Netflix’s reputation as an innovator may be a little more generous than perhaps it deserves, but Netflix has remained true to itself and to the vision of its founders.", "Netflix has also managed to retain the flexibility that all growing companies need to effectively respond to a rapidly changing marketplace without losing the focus it needed to sustain such ambitious growth.", "Whether there’s any truth to the tale of how a $40 late fee on a copy of Apollo 13 gave rise to one of the largest entertainment companies in the world, the rise and rise of Netflix certainly makes for an entertaining story.", "How that story will end is anyone’s guess—but I suspect it’ll have a happy ending."]}

Obviously, it was Netflix.", "I’ll let you know why.. (And I’m under no illusions that I’ll actually have one of these questions asked.)", "Normally, if you asked me if earnings calls matter, I’d say no. Sure, the letter to shareholders will have some data, and the quarterly reports matter to investors, but the presentation is the most self-interested presentation imaginable.", "It would be like listening to just the closing statement of the prosecution in a trial. You’d get a lot more guilty verdicts, don’t you think?", "But I have a much larger project I hope to unveil sometime this year where I make a “power ranking” of streaming/bundling services.", "From ad-supported to sports, anything digital video I will rank in one definitive list. Like sports power rankings, if you go to ESPN or any sports website nowadays.", "To build that ranking requires good information, like all good decisions. And right now the company that has the most black holes in data, for me, is Netflix.", "Since I’ve written about their data and even coined a phrase about how selectively they pull it (read here for “datecdotes”), I naturally had the most questions for Netflix, and they convinced me to finally write an email.", "To be fair—meaning unbiased across all digital video companies—I hope to roll out this type of feature semi-regularly with other digital video companies.", "Google, Apple and Disney are the most relevant, though Disney gets a brief reprieve with all the information they dropped on us last week.", "Youtube deserves a ton of questions and so does Apple with their paucity of information.", "With that preamble, onto the questions. I have three big areas: Viewership (to see how valuable their content is), activity (to gauge how subscribers interact with the site) and subscribers (to probe their business model a bit).", "After each question, I’ll explain my reasoning in parentheses. These explanations I didn’t send!", "– In the last earnings call, Netflix reported that Bird Box was viewed by 80 million customers over the first four weeks.", "During that time, was it the most viewed movie on your platform? Over 2019 as a whole, was it the most viewed movie on your platform?", "Have any Star Wars, Marvel or Disney Animated films had more viewers than Bird Box since their respective launches?", "(As we look to the battlefield of 2020, churn is the name of the game. Is the most popular content on Netflix leaving?", "I believe it is with either Friends (or other long running TV shows like it) or all the Disney content.", "This question helps get at that for the movies side, especially the Disney content.)", "– In the Q3 earnings call of last year, you said that 80 million unique customer accounts had watched one or more “Summer of Love” romantic comedies on your site, was that using the same standard as Bird Box, where you counted “watched” as 70% completion of a film?", "(If Netflix answers this, I’d be shocked. My guess is they moved to the 70% threshold after minor pushback on their Q3 report.", "They knew they had to explain the calculation, but waited for a film that did well enough, like Bird Box, to justify it.", "Still, if they say, “No”, then that “Summer of Love” number can be severely discounted. Likely they won’t ever answer either way.)", "– How many people watched The Christmas Chronicles? Or The Ballad of Buster Scruggs or Private Life? How many hours have customers viewed for any of this content?", "(You reported in the last earnings call that you do track hours viewed on site.)", "(Again, this is to help flesh out the context of whatever numbers they do release. And the scale of losses.", "This is the best example of how one-sided an earnings report is. If there were a “defendant” making the bear case, these are the numbers their defense lawyers would seize on to make their case, to continue the prosecutor announcement from earlier.)", "– In 2018, what was your monthly active users? What has been your monthly active users in 2019?", "(Monthly active users is the metrics that “feels” right for me when it comes to truly understanding the people who love your service.", "I don’t have data, but my gut that it explains usage best. Monthly users are the people who devoured some piece of your content in their entertainment diet.", "Subscribers is not that. If I were “entertainment czar” all streamers would have to release this.)", "– You reported the service “averages” 100 million hours a day of viewing in the US in a month. How much does that average vary by month?", "What does the time on site distribution look like by customer decile? What was the annual daily average?", "(We all hate averages, don’t we? Well I do. They don’t tell use anything. And since someone quoted the “2 hours per day” number to me for Netflix usage recently, it made me want to know a lot more about it.", "Also, related to this is the variance overtime. December happens to be a huge month for Netflix, so touting numbers from December is deliberately overselling the annual performance.)", "– In your Q4 report, you mentioned a net add of 29 million customer accounts. What was the number of gross adds versus net?", "How does this breakdown internationally versus US? You used to report gross adds in 2011, why did you move away from this metric?", "(I didn’t know Netflix used to report this, and this is the type of number they should report, if you follow the standard, “Does the CEO get this information?”", "Because Reed Hastings definitely does. [I love that standard, by the way.] Again, churn is the name of the game, and the great thing about Netflix’s 60 million or subscribers is that it grows steadily every year.", "Which gives an illusion of stability the gross number would help understand. International is even more curious for me.)", "– What is the total unique subscriber base you have had in the US since you launched streaming?", "(My final way to get at the churn questions. Say Netflix had had 140 million unique subscribers in the US since launching in 2008.", "Some of those are duplicate accounts—people who signed up, then switched—surely. But some aren’t. That gets to the idea that it isn’t like Netflix is convincing people to try Netflix for the first time, but to come back.", "Which is fascinating, to me, and a different business challenge.)"]}

So, if other European carmakers' results are suspect, Bernstein says the \"consequences are likely to be a change in the test cycle rather than legal action and fines\".", "Certainly is.

And the teams spent too much time asking, “What will Reed think?” and not enough time asking, “What will customers think?”", "The irony was that as much as Reed wanted to let go of critical decisions, he set up a dynamic where folks felt they needed to present work to him before making a decision.", "Over time, I set up quarterly product strategy meetings.

The meeting becomes less effective once you have more than twenty people in the room.", "Include a few key “C” and VP-level leaders and product managers as presenters, plus critical consumer insight, data, design, and technology partners.", "I evaluated participation by VP-level folks outside the product organization on a case-by-case basis.", "It’s helpful to include the CEO, especially if he or she is product, data, or engineering-focused, to add “heat.”", "- It’s NOT a decision-making meeting. If product leaders have successful AB test results, for instance, launch the new experience before the meeting.", "The point of the forum is to encourage fast-paced decision-making — not slow it down.", "At Netflix, there were three indirect results of the meeting:", "- A very results-focused organization. If your product area got results and moved metrics meaningfully, it got more resources.", "- You learned which product leaders were strong and, over time, which leaders’ skills were not scaling as the company grew.", "In the case of Netflix, some product leaders were strong “starters,” but as the company got bigger, it needed “builders” to help Netflix scale.", "Over time, certain areas required increasing domain expertise as the company matured. (Some product leaders at Netflix today have Masters in Statistics; in the early startup days, only a few had taken a statistics course.)", "- These outcomes meant that the quarterly meetings had a direct effect on the product organization and the company’s culture.", "Today, as an adviser and EIR Product for companies, the meeting is a highly leveraged technique to help teams develop into world-class product organizations.", "It’s a handy tool to help fast-growing startups scale, build a learning organization, keep groups aligned, and stay data—and consumer-focused.", "And because it happens quarterly, there’s an opportunity to improve through iteration.", "Below is my step-by-step approach to setting up the meeting.", "HOW TO EXECUTE THE QUARTERLY PRODUCT STRATEGY MEETING", "The most important job of a product leader is to outline a cohesive product strategy, along with metrics and tactics against these strategies.", "I define the product leader’s job as delighting customers in hard-to-copy, margin-enhancing ways. Your product strategy should define your hypotheses about delivering on these three dimensions.", "The metrics are how you measure your progress, and the tactics are simply projects or experiments against each of your key strategies.", "In the first 30 minutes of the Quarterly Product Strategy meeting, I reinforce the company’s overall product strategy.", "Below, I outline how these pieces fit together from my early days at Netflix as the company navigated the transition from DVD to streaming.", "The first section describes the “steps” for Netflix’s planned growth, reinforcing that not everything had to happen at once — the company’s product focus would shift in phases over multiple decades.", "Today, I call the above structure the “GLEe” model. (Note the first letter in each step.) The exercise forces product leaders to think about how the company and product might grow in “waves” and force longer-term thinking.", "The exercise also helps product leaders avoid the “one and done” phenomenon articulated by Jeff Kagan, a financial analyst who reflected on Yahoo!", "‘s demise: “Every successful company rides the growth wave until it crests and falls. The secret is to create the next growth wave before the first one collapses.”", "The GLEe model encouraged the team to consider “what’s next.”", "The next section articulates key hypotheses for how Netflix hoped to delight customers in margin-enhancing, hard-to-copy ways.", "It also includes projects against these strategies and the metrics the team used to evaluate the hypotheses' success or failure, typically via AB tests.", "When Netflix started its subscription service, nearly 10% of its members canceled each month. In 2005, the monthly cancelation was 5%.", "Below are the key product strategies in 2007. Each strategy's intent was to delight customers in hard-to-copy, margin-enhancing ways, as measured by retention.", "I started each quarterly product strategy meeting by reinforcing the strategies using a tactic I call “lather, rinse, repeat.”", "As the company grew, I constantly re-articulated the product strategies as hypotheses failed or the company took on new challenges.", "If product leaders on my team couldn’t remember the strategy, I viewed it as a leadership failure on my part.", "I was unclear or failed to communicate the strategy in a memorable, inspired way.", "Note: I have chosen not to publish failed strategies. One example is our social strategy, or “Friends,” which we killed in 2009.", "Another was a theory that a more entertaining merchandising experience would significantly improve retention—it didn’t.", "Organize the product teams into meaningful “swim lanes.”", "One way to develop a startup's fast-paced decision-making and execution is to break down organizations into smaller teams.", "We organized the product teams at Netflix into different “swim lanes.” The expectation is that each product leader can outline their one key metric—“the one they will move, or I will kill them (ha!)”—and can define the strategies, tactics, hypotheses, and tests to move this metric.", "Here were the ten Netflix team “swim lanes” circa 2007. Each product leader had a “pod” that included engineering, design, and data partners.", "I would articulate the high-level product strategy.

I handle this on a case-by-case basis.

You seek high-level alignment against the overall strategy.", "But leaders don’t need to consult multiple groups to make every decision—that’s tight coupling. You want people to focus, to “play their position,” and not meddle in other leaders’ areas.", "Today, I like to have product leaders publish their work the day before the meeting. The Product leaders typically use Google Docs or Slides to share their best thinking, and all participants read the materials in advance and comment online with thoughts and questions.", "The next day at the meeting, the product leaders present a subset of their work, informed by the comments.", "Product leaders use half their allotted time for presentation and half for discussion and debate.", "All attendees are expected to participate aggressively in the pre-reading and the meeting. There is no room for bystanders.", "Again, the pre-work articulates each swim lane’s one-pager shares key results and learnings and outlines future theories and hypotheses for research or testing.", "From time to time, the material describes critical roadblocks or dependencies the product leader has outside their area.", "The best materials are data- and design-rich, showing well-presented results and the ability to move key metrics within the product leader’s area.", "In the case of future tests, the product leader is clear about their hypotheses, the test design for these hypotheses, and how the design will come to life in the consumer’s eyes.", "And whether the tests are a success or failure, the results inevitably add to the collective wisdom of the product organization.", "Depending on the size of your product organization, the quarterly product strategy meeting can range from two hours to an all-day session.", "The length depends on how many swim lanes your product organization has.

Sometimes, there are no critical issues or learnings to share, especially for long-term projects.", "- It’s helpful to keep a running list of open issues during the meeting and to save an hour at the end of the session to outline the next steps and timing.", "- A secondary effect of the meeting is that it helps build a strong sense of teamwork. Dinner and beer together at the end of the day is a good habit.", "- I use SurveyMonkey to implement a Net Promoter Score for the meeting and generate ideas about how to improve the next session.", "WARNING: No one loves meetings, so the typical NPS for a highly engaging, productive meeting is in the 40s, although I have seen one meeting with an NPS of 100.", "- I encourage the product leader to share some of the key results or insights at future company meetings.", "I use this tactic to rationalize NOT including too many folks in the meeting. Instead, we’ll let folks know about the results at the next all-hands meeting and share a small subset of the meeting’s content at the next board meeting.", "(Most board members are CFOs—they appreciate the disciplined, data-driven approach and a high-level, four-quarter rolling product plan.)", "Quarterly Product Strategy Meetings: The Good, The Bad, and the Ugly", "A good meeting is like a movie — there should be conflict, debate, and eventual resolution. Here are some of the things I look for in successful quarterly product strategy meetings:", "- Intense preparation and engagement before the meeting.", "- Product leaders stay focused on their key hypotheses (strategies). Their work is data—and design-rich, and they show it through their customers’ eyes.", "- Product leaders don’t share everything. They stay focused on the things that matter.", "- The room sees value in successful and failed tests as opportunities to learn and pass on knowledge from one swim lane to another.", "The more innovative companies I work with have a remarkable tolerance for failure.", "- Product leaders demonstrate a mix of optimization (tests that can move key metrics by five to twenty percent) and innovation (things that can potentially double, 10x, or 100x performance).", "Typically, three-quarters of the projects focus on optimization, while one-quarter focus on “big bets.”", "Without teasing out the optimization v. innovation balance, I find most teams focus too much on optimization and too little on big bets.", "The odds for failure are much higher for innovation, and product leaders need encouragement to take on this higher level of risk — to enjoy the higher potential for reward.", "- Open debate and conversation. People don’t hold back or resort to political, side conversations.", "- Many Quarterly Product Strategy meetings reveal “diving catches” where work in one product area depends on unplanned work in another.", "While many view this as a mistake, I see it positively. These diving catches are consistent with tightly aligned, loosely coupled organizations.", "I’d much rather have an occasional diving catch than lots of planning and coordination meetings between disparate teams.", "The diving catch means teams are moving fast without spending too much time coordinating with each other.", "- Over many quarters, the cadence of each product area substantially increases—they can execute more tests to generate more learning, which continually fine-tunes instincts about what, in the long term, will build both consumer and shareholder value.", "Over time, the product teams effectively “lengthen their stride” and are willing to take on more risk.", "Conversely, ineffective product strategy meetings have the wrong people in the room, too many people, a lack of sufficient focus on data and metrics, and devolve into PowerPoint beauty shows with too many political “sidebar” conversations.", "I work with many consumer tech startups today, and each has a critical issue: their ability to scale fast.", "I utilize this relatively lightweight process to help startups stay focused and disciplined. But I’m careful not to engage in a heavy-handed way that can potentially squeeze the life out of the creative process or the company’s potential for innovation.", "The heavy-handed process is anathema to innovative companies. Intelligent people like to work on challenging problems with other bright people and with minimal process.", "Strategy and articulation of that “one key metric” and how you will move it, coupled with high cadence testing and learning, is the key to delivering consumer and shareholder value.", "The other benefit of having clearly described strategies and metrics is that it makes it easier to say “no” to stuff, which is the main benefit of strategy — defining what you won’t do.", "I often remind my partners, ‘we can do anything, we just can’t do everything.’", "The other benefit of quarterly product strategy meetings is their focus on “what” we will build. Companies get too engaged in “how we build stuff,” which is necessary, but the “what we will build”—defined by the strategy and measured by the metrics—is more important.", "It’s good to spend a day focused on “what we are building and why.”", "As for Netflix today, the “Product Review Meeting” continues, but typical of Netflix, it has evolved dramatically.", "Todd Yellin, now VP of Product at Netflix, runs the quarterly meeting and says, “The meeting has changed almost beyond recognition.", "It has evolved more into a discussion about hot business and customer-centric issues and, yes, Reed still attends.”", "Please let me know if this is helpful to you and if I can help you frame and develop a light process like this—a board meeting for the product—to help your product and company become a consumer-focused, highly innovative learning machine.", "If you enjoyed this essay, please “clap” to make it easier for others to find.

CEO Bob Iger has dubbed the initiative Disney’s “biggest priority” for 2019, with much of the original programming expected to lean on the company’s popular franchises like Marvel and Star Wars.", "The service also has the competitive advantage of being the only place that users can stream new Disney movies after they premiere in theaters.", "Disney also owns ESPN+, and now controls Hulu after its blockbuster deal for 21st Century Fox Inc. (FOXA) closed last month.", "As Netflix gears up to report its most recent quarterly results at the end of April, Raymond James warns that there could be some short-term volatility as a result of potentially lackluster Q2 guidance.", "“There could be noise around second-quarter guidance,” wrote Patterson. “Game of Thrones and Avengers competition, a lighter content slate, foreign-exchange-rate volatility, and phasing of price increases warrant a more conservative guide.", "That’s fine.

General Data Protection Regulation sets out a single broadly defined regime for health data (as well as other data), no matter what format, how it is collected, or who the custodian is.26", "It defines the category of “data concerning health” broadly to mean “personal data related to the physical or mental health of a natural person, including the provision of health care services, which reveal information about his or her health status.", "The custodians that U.S. law focuses on are physicians, health systems, and their business associates.", "The major U.S. federal law governing health data privacy is the Privacy Rule created under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA)—there are also state-specific privacy laws, and the federal Common Rule, which protects research subjects, but they are not our focus here.28", "Under the HIPAA Privacy Rule, “covered entities” are prohibited from using or disclosing “protected health information” (PHI) except in a specified list of circumstances; “business associates” face similar limitations under required contracts with covered entities.29", "The definition of PHI is broad, including most individually identifiable health information; “covered entities” includes most health care providers, health insurance companies, and “health information clearinghouses.”29", "HIPAA creates a set of rules that are arguably both overprotective and underprotective of privacy (HIPAA also directly protects information security through a separate Security Rule30).", "On the overprotective side, while HIPAA allows use of PHI for health care treatment (including “quality improvement”), operations, payment, public health, and law enforcement—it does not allow the use of PHI without IRB waiver or patient authorization for research, which is to say the systematic production of generalizable knowledge.31", "As to health data covered by HIPAA, the rule also has gaps. One of HIPAA’s most important strategies for protecting patients from privacy breaches while enabling data sharing is deidentifying their data by removing a set of 18 specified identifiers like names and email addresses.32 However, deidentified data may become re-identifiable through data triangulation from other data sets (see Text Box 2).25, 33, 34, 35 Moreover, HIPAA focuses its regulation on particular actors and their activities, not the data themselves.", "For instance, once patients request their own health data—which HIPAA gives them the right to do, and some concerted efforts encourage patients to do36, 37—if the patients give those data to another individual, HIPAA does not restrict use or disclosure of those data (unless the recipient is another covered entity or a business associate).25", "Text Box 2. The challenge of multiple data sets for re-identifiability.", "Many assume that “anonymized” data cannot be used to re-identify the subject of the data. Unfortunately, as data sets proliferate, the ability to combine multiple data sets may defeat the deidentification strategy.", "The most famous example, which preceded HIPAA, was demonstrated by Latanya Sweeney, then a graduate student.", "In the 1990’s, the state of Massachusetts purchased health insurance for state employees and subsequently released records summarizing every state employee’s hospital visits at no cost to any researcher who requested the data.", "Then-Governor William Weld assured the public the data had been scrubbed to defeat re-identification, by removing information such as names, addresses, and Social Security numbers.", "Unfortunately, many patient attributes were not scrubbed. Sweeney knew Weld resided in the city of Cambridge and purchased the complete voter rolls from the city, which contained the name, address, ZIP code, birth date, and sex of every voter in the city.", "She paired that data with the state health insurance data to demonstrate that one could re-identify Weld’s prescriptions, diagnosis, and medical history.", "A more recent example of the same problem outside of medicine pertains to the prize offered by Netflix in the mid-2000s to improve its movie recommendation algorithm.", "To enable the competition, Netflix publicly released one-hundred million records revealing hundreds of thousands of user ratings from 1999 to 2005.", "Netflix stripped identifying information, but added unique user numbers to group ratings by users. Two researchers from the University of Texas, Arvind Narayanan and Vitaly Shmatikov, showed that one could nonetheless re-identify Netflix users by linking to other data sets.", "In particular, they drew on the publicly available data from the Internet Movie Database (IMDb), wherein users also rate movies but do so publicly, to offer a proof of concept.", "They showed that: “Given a user’s public IMDb ratings, which the user posted voluntarily to reveals some of his … movie likes and dislikes, we discover all ratings that he entered privately into the Netflix system.”", "In particular, their reidentification strategy took advantage of ratings for more obscure movies in both systems and also the timing in which reviews were posted.", "To be sure, neither of these examples are meant to show that deidentification is never possible or that reidentification will always be easy.", "Instead, they are meant to show how the increase in the number of datasets and linking of information makes reidentification more plausible even for data that had otherwise been thought deidentified.", "But the more fundamental problem is that the majority of health data is not covered by HIPAA at all. When Congress enacted HIPAA in 1996, it envisioned a regime where most health data would be held in health records and accordingly focused on health care providers and other covered entities.", "In the big-data world, the type of data sources covered by HIPAA are but a small part of a larger health data ecosystem.", "HIPAA does not cover health care data generated outside of covered entities and business associates, such as health care related information recorded by life insurance companies.", "It does also does not cover health (as opposed to health care) data generated by a myriad of people or products other than the patient.", "It does not cover user-generated information about health, such as the use of a blood-sugar-tracking smartphone app or a set of Google searches about particular symptoms and insurance coverage for serious disorders.", "And it certainly does not cover the huge volume of data that is not about health at all, but permits inferences about health—such as when the information about a shopper’s Target purchases famously revealed her pregnancy.35, 38, 39 This focus on data specifically arising from health care contrasts with European regulation of “data concerning health” more generally.", "We are already entering a future where traditional health care spaces, HIPAA’s “covered entities,” are being supplanted in the health data space by behemoths like Google, Apple, or IBM—all of which operate outside of HIPAA’s regime.", "While, as we discuss below, some laws may protect particular uses of those data, overall there is little to protect patients from these threats to their health privacy in the U.S. at the moment.", "Another concern is not that too much data is taken from patients, but that data collection is not occurring equitably.", "As an ethical matter data collection is best justified as a kind of “bargain” struck between data sources and data users—provide us your data, recognizing this may encroach in some ways on your privacy, because it will permit us to provide advances in health care that will improve your life.", "When this balance is off, the bargain may break down. As has been shown for predictive analytics in policing, existing bias can reappear in data mining, as when racial disparities in policing patterns result in racially biased predictions of criminal activity.40 Unfortunately, health data have many of the same problems.", "Marginalized populations that are missing from non-health data such as credit card use or internet history—leading to biases in credit scores or consumer profiles—may also be absent from big health data, such as genomic databases or electronic health records, due in part to lack of health insurance, the inability to access healthcare, and a number of other reasons.41 The distributional consequences of this lack of inclusion in “big data” are complex; in some instances it may favor but in other instances disfavor those whose data are missing.", "For example, consider an allocation decision between multiple patients as to a scarce medical resource.", "If a particular minority group actually responds less well to the medical intervention then other groups, failure to collect information on the minority group might lead the algorithm to give the minority patient more priority than had the data been included.", "If the minority group responds better than other groups, the opposite effect might result. Whichever way it cuts, though, the result will be that the system’s prediction will be problematically biased.", "This is a hard nut to crack, among other reasons because of contested and incompatible definitions of “fairness” in the predictive analytics space.42, 43 One solution in our contexts, of course, is better access to health care for the underserved populations, but if that goal is reached it will not be because of big data needs.", "Statistical adjustment for data gaps may help mitigate the problem somewhat, but this is an area to which funders (especially public funders) should be attuned.", "The All of Us program, for instance, aims to develop a nationally representative sample for its genomic work.44 While that ambition will not be realizable for all big data research, funders should consider asking applicants to explicitly address their strategies for making their data sets more inclusive and take that into consideration in allocating grants.", "The role of the patient in data collection and access", "To what extent should an individual’s data be available for use in predictive analytics without her consent, for example the use of electronic health records without consent to build the proprietary CancerChoice model discussed in box 1?", "Especially for deontological concerns with health privacy, the loss of control over who accesses one’s data and for what purpose matters, even if there are no material consequences for the individual or the individual does not even know.", "Should some health data be seen as a kind of public good that can be conscripted for some potentially publicly minded uses?", "Here the notion of privacy as stemming from contextual rules, discussed above, is particularly helpful.", "The ethical analysis will depend heavily on the type of data, including its identifiability; who will be accessing it; and for what purpose.", "Take one data source, EHR data stripped of the 18 HIPAA identifiers. One might feel differently about the CDC accessing it for flu tracking purposes, compared to a hospital system using it to reevaluate its staffing and workflow to improve both cost efficiency and patient experience, compared to a pharmaceutical company using it for product development.", "Even if privacy is violated, it may be that, all-things-considered, the violation is outweighed by equitably distributed benefits in some cases.", "As a guiding principle for this analysis, one might think that individually unconsented use is more appropriate (especially for relatively deidentified data) the more the contributing patient will benefit from the data use—a principle of reciprocity—and where the risks to the patient (including the consequentialist risks discussed below) are low, such that the “ask” of patients is small compared to the benefit—a principle of proportionality.17, 45", "Second, whether or not patients consent for their data to be included within a set, what role should they have in deciding what kind of uses of their data are permissible?", "This is a question of designing a governance regime—and it matters to patient privacy because, as discussed below, many of the privacy harms of big health data arise not merely in the collection of data, but in their eventual use.", "On one extreme, one could imagine enabling every patient to approve every access to every piece of data individually after a purpose has been stated—a regime that would maximize patient autonomy but could eliminate most work using big health data.46", "On the other extreme, one could treat data as completely “alienable,” such that the patient retains no rights of control, whether by external mandate or by “broad consent,” as has been proposed in the biobank context.47, 48 As noted, our conception of privacy is contextual and the analysis will depend on the specifics of who seeks access to what data in what way for what purpose.", "For many cases, though, the optimal governance regime may lie somewhere in the middle. This might involve, for example, chartering a steering board that includes representative patients in deciding which requests for data to permit and under what circumstances.", "One analogy would be the Independent Review Panels that have been used to approve or deny requests for the sharing of clinical trial data.49 A slightly different approach would be to actually put the data in a charitable trust, with trustees (some of whom would be patient representatives) making decisions about access conditions and approved uses while owing fiduciary duties to the patients’ whose data is used, a model championed by some for biobanks.50", "Still another approach is what Barbara Evans, a law professor at the University of Houston, calls “consumer driven data commons,” “institutions that enable groups of consenting individuals to collaborate to assemble powerful, large-scale health data resources for use in scientific research, on terms the group members themselves would set.”51", "There are many other governance possibilities,52 including so-called “citizen juries” that have been used in the UK in these domains,53 but especially where individualized patient consent will not be used it is important to have patient representatives involved in the crucial decisions about how their data will be used.", "While approaches built on any of these models may be feasible at the current moment, they may be less feasible in a future where data sets—containing not only huge amounts but huge varieties of data—are used for multiple different analyses.", "Such cross-context datasets and data-uses—using collections of consumer data to make health predictions, or collections of health data to target advertising, or joint collections to do both—would make it harder to meaningfully set one governance regime for consumer data and another for health data.", "And to the extent that policymakers today require context-specific regimes, they may limit exactly that future development of cross-context datasets, for good and ill.", "In this section, we outline major legal and ethical privacy issues raised by using already-collected patient data, especially in AI-driven systems, and approaches for addressing them.", "The use of patient-derived big data in medicine can lead to consequentialist privacy concerns. One well-characterized set of objective harms comes from the possibility of discrimination: if employers or insurers learn of sensitive patient information from medical data, such as a debilitating or expensive disease, they may wish not to employ or insure that person, especially since in the U.S. health insurance is typically tied to employment.54", "Some would argue that this type of discrimination is justified under a principle of “actuarial fairness,” where everyone should pay or be paid according to their risk as precisely as possible55—an enterprise which big data could make much easier.", "This raises some very fundamental question about whether to favor a notion of “to each according to his risk” as opposed to a more solidaristic view of insurance, whereby to some extent we redistribute through insurance pooling.56 In any event, our existing laws in health insurance and employment contexts have favored the latter view, prohibiting some but not all of this sort of discrimination:57", "The Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act (GINA) prohibits discrimination by health insurers or employers on the basis of genetic information, the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) prohibits discrimination in employment and insurance based on medical conditions that are disabilities, and the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA) prohibits health insurance discrimination and sharply limits medical underwriting.", "These laws represent an attempt to limit consequentialist privacy harms by limiting consequences of access to data, rather than focusing on protecting data themselves (though GINA does also include some limits on data acquisition).", "But these laws have important limits. The ADA, for example, will not limit uses of big data to adversely treat “people who are currently healthy but are perceived as being at high risk of becoming sick in the future.", "”58 Neither GINA nor the ADA reaches life insurance. And even when these laws do apply, they can be hard to enforce because it is often hard to know when discrimination has occurred.", "Moreover, other kinds of consequentialist harms are hard to address through law at all, such as stigma that can arise from others knowing about a sexually transmitted infection or learning that a child’s parent is not the child’s biological parent.", "A recent survey of clinical trial participants on the sharing of participant-level clinical trial data beyond genomic information found that 6.6% were “very concerned” and 14.9% were “somewhat concern” that “I could be discriminated against if the information was linked back to me,” but as the authors acknowledge, specific characteristics of that study population, especially the fact that they have already decided to participate in clinical trials, may make it a poor predictor for general public attitudes on these questions.", "A second set of consequentialist privacy harms involves more subjective injuries. Patients whose private health information becomes available can suffer embarrassment, paranoia or mental pain.", "Even though these injuries may not have measurable external effects—the patients may suffer no financial injury or encounter no stigma from others—they are still injuries.61 Laws like GINA, the ADA, or the PPACA have little purchase on this type of injury.", "Big data also raises the possibility of more dignitary harms. In order to live a flourishing life, it is important that there be part of our lives that is ours alone, that others do not know unless we share it with them.", "Facts about our health are particularly sensitive and private. In some instances, big data permits direct knowledge of our health by those we would not want to access the information— whether through inadvertent disclosure or malicious activities such as hacking.", "Most people are woefully unaware of the uses to which their data may be put; a particularly salient example comes from use of the GEDmatch genetic database to help identify the Golden State Killer.62 This example also helpfully illustrates the problem that information shared about one individual may reveal information about other individuals—here, genetic relatives—who are unaware that potentially revealing information has been shared, and who have not consented to the sharing.", "A more subtle and more difficult issue raised by predictive analytics is whether our privacy is breached when others make inferences about us as opposed to know things about us.63 Jeff Skopek, a law professor at Cambridge University, argues that “data mining often generates knowledge about people through the process of inference rather than direct observation or access, and there are both legal and normative grounds for rejecting the notion that inferences can violate privacy.”64", "To put the question another way, consider pregnancy. If I were to believe that you are pregnant by stealing your OB/GYN’s records or tapping your phone, that would clearly represent a privacy violation.", "However, if we are friends and I reach a belief that you are pregnant by seeing that you stop drinking when we go out for dinner, change your diet, and have put on some weight, it is hard to argue I have violated your privacy.", "The question is whether big data analysis is more like the former or more like the latter. Of course, big data enables us to make many more inferences with much more confidence than do the friendly observations of pregnancy, but is the deontological analysis about the amount we believe we know or the route by which we believe we know it?", "One reaction to the health privacy violations described above, both deontological and consequentialist, is to sharply limit access to patient data.", "Particularly if deontological and consequentialist concerns are difficult to decrease ex post, decreasing access to data ex ante seems like an attractive solution.65 Under this approach, perhaps data sharing should be limited to the minimal amount necessary in all contexts, data should be retained only for limited time, or data should be intentionally obfuscated, if consequential harms are difficult to limit.66 Nevertheless, we argue that limits on data access can bring their own harms.", "The basic harm of privacy overprotection is the brakes it puts on data-driven innovation.67 Privacy protections limit both data aggregation, whether in the creation of longitudinal records or in the collation of data from different sources at the same time, and innovative data use.", "As a straightforward example, data de-identification is a common way to comply with HIPAA requirements—but de-identified data are much harder to link together when a patient sees different providers, gets insurance through different payers over time, or moves state-to-state.31, 51 Patchy, fragmented health data make data-driven innovation hard, imposing both technological and economic hurdles.", "Some approaches can protect privacy while minimizing the cost to innovation, and these should be pursued.", "In some contexts, researchers could use techniques involving pseudonymized data or differential privacy rather than identified data.68, 69, 70 Privacy audits can ensure appropriate use and security standards should guard against unauthorized use.", "Data holders should be stewards of data, not privacy-agnostic intermediaries. But in many contexts a privacy/innovation tradeoff will still exist.", "Privacy also interacts problematically with secrecy. As described above, there are many potential innovations that can arise from data, and some of these may be very lucrative, such as an algorithm that accurately selects cancer drugs.", "Innovators have incentives to keep data secret to maintain a competitive advantage in development and deployment of such valuable innovations.71 But we might prefer as a society to have access to the data on which such innovations are based: others can use those data to create better predictors from the same data, to aggregate data to find more subtle patterns, or to validate and verify that the original innovator’s research was accurate.", "Myriad Genetics’ maintenance of a proprietary database of the genetic sequences and medical history of women who sought BRCA1/2 breast and ovarian cancer predisposition tests exemplifies these concerns; non-Myriad tests returned variants of unknown significance more frequently because Myriad’s data were unavailable, and the data could not be aggregated to provide even better tests.72 Privacy concerns can provide a shield—rhetorical or not—for this type of practice; to the extent that firms can justify keeping proprietary data on the basis that they are protecting patients’ privacy, data sharing is harder to demand.", "Privacy-justified secrecy can erode trust in already-opaque big-data innovations. When big data yields surprising insights about how to provide care, providers and patients need to trust the results to implement them.", "This already creates challenges when the insights come from explicit analyses of big data; when machine-learning and opaque algorithms are involved, trust may be even harder to engender.", "To the extent that data and algorithms are kept secret under a potentially disingenuous veil of privacy protection, providers and patients will have even less cause for trust in the results.73 To be sure, there are many medical processes whose inner workings are shrouded by trade secrecy and very opaque to patients, but the media attention to and newness of big data and artificial intelligence may make patients particularly nervous about their integration into care.", "On the other hand, to the extent that patients concerned about privacy refuse to participate in a data-driven system, those algorithms may not even be developed in the first place.", "Striking the right balance—protecting privacy so that patients are comfortable providing their data, but not allowing privacy to drive secrecy that reduces validation and trust in the potential benefits arising from those data—will be a tricky challenge for proponents of big data, machine learning, and learning health systems.", "What is more, the answer will not be uniform. The future of big data privacy will be sensitive to data source, data custodian, and type of data, as well as the importance of data triangulation from multiple sources.", "But it is important that we not assume privacy maximalism across the board is the way to go.

Loeb, Darling-Hammond, and Luczak (2005), for example, find that the measured influence of school characteristics on turnover is sensitive to the introduction of variables measuring working conditions (such as salaries, class sizes, facilities problems, lack of textbooks, etc.) in the specification, which indicates the link between conditions and school poverty.", "The authors do not conduct separate analyses (nor use interaction terms), but in their sequence of models, the credential variables’ coefficients are sensitive in size and statistical significance to the introduction of a control for school poverty and also the variables measuring working conditions.", "9. Although in this series we use share of low-income students to examine (in)equities in the teacher shortage across schools, we could alternatively employ other indicators of disadvantage—such as share of minority students, students with disabilities, or students who are English Language Learners—which could also enlighten us about other sets of inequities.", "Generically, schools with high concentrations of these subgroups are sometimes referred to as “high-needs” schools.", "10. The lower credentials of staying teachers in high-poverty schools relative to low-poverty schools are the result of the patterns shown in Tables 1 and 2: one, that the credentials of teachers in high-poverty schools are lower than in high-poverty schools; and two, that the link between attrition and credentials is weaker in high-poverty schools, allowing for highly qualified teachers to move or quit the profession at different rates for similar credentials across the two types of schools.", "11. Technically, these drivers can be broken down into supply-side drivers (such as the number of people interested in and training to be teachers and the attachment existing teachers feel to the profession) and demand-side drivers (such as the number of teachers needed for a given number of students with a given set of needs, or the size of school budgets).", "Rising student enrollment and the trend toward smaller classes clearly increase demand (shift demand curve out to the right), while worsening work conditions (decreased autonomy, teaching to the test, and increasing behavioral problems) reduce supply (shift the supply curve to the left).", "Other drivers, however, are muddier, since labor markets, especially public-sector labor markets, operate with a lag (the number of students in teaching pipelines reflects past, not current, conditions) and are not textbook competitive markets.", "High turnover, for example, might be driving “supply” (if keeping all other drivers constant), but turnover might also be driven by teachers who are leaving teaching or moving to other districts due to other issues driving “demand” or affecting “matching.”", "In the teacher labor market literature, terms such as “recruitment and retention” are used, but these are technically about “matching” rather than the “supply side.”", "12.

collection of Digital 2019 Reports reveals that internet users are now growing by an average of more than one million new users every day, with all of the original ‘Next Billion Users’ now online.", "The number of people using the internet has surged over the past year, with more than one million people coming online for the first time each day since January 2018.", "It’s not just internet users that have been growing either, as the extensive new collection of Digital 2019 reports from Hootsuite and We Are Social reveals.", "We’ll explore all of the key trends and insights from this year’s reports in detail below, but here are the essential headlines you need in order to understand ‘Digital in 2019’:", "There are 5.11 billion unique mobile users in the world today, up 100 million (2 percent) in the past year.", "There are 4.39 billion internet users in 2019, an increase of 366 million (9 percent) versus January 2018.", "There are 3.48 billion social media users in 2019, with the worldwide total growing by 288 million (9 percent) since this time last year.", "3.26 billion people use social media on mobile devices in January 2019, with growth of 297 million new users representing a year-on-year increase of more than 10 percent", "With thousands of charts across more than 200 global and local reports, this year’s Global Digital series is one of the most comprehensive and up-to-date studies of today’s connected world.", "We’ll be publishing those local country reports in stages over the coming days here on DataReportal, but this article and the SlideShare embed above distil the essential headlines, trends, and insights you need in order to make sense of digital in 2019.", "Before we get into the analysis though, I’d like to take a moment to thank all of the wonderful data partners who’ve made this year’s series of reports possible, in particular:", "Now, just before we get started with all those numbers, you may want to go grab a coffee and get comfortable.", "There’s a huge amount of information to digest in the 8,800 words below, and you’ll want to take time to make sense of it all.", "I’m sure I say this every year, but 2018 really was another year of impressive growth across all things digital.", "However, perhaps the most compelling story in this year’s numbers is that internet user growth actually accelerated in the past year, with more than 366 million new users coming online since we published our Digital 2018 reports.", "Our latest internet data – collected and synthesised from a wide variety of reputable sources – shows that internet users are growing at a rate of more than 11 new users per second, which results in that impressive total of one million new users each day.", "It’s worth noting that some of this growth may be attributable to more up-to-date reporting of user numbers, but that doesn’t detract from the implications of this growth.", "We’re particularly encouraged to see that a significant proportion of this year’s growth has come from developing economies, with countries that previously suffered from lacklustre internet penetration posting some strong gains as we start 2019.", "The standout story here is India, which has seen internet users jump by almost 100 million in the past 12 months, representing annual growth of more than 20 percent.", "Internet penetration in the South Asian country now stands at roughly 41 percent – a considerable improvement over the 31 percent that we reported this time last year.", "These big numbers mean that India is responsible for more than a quarter of this year’s total global growth.", "Overall, Asia-Pacific delivered 55 percent of the annual growth figure, with China adding another 50 million new users in the past year.", "Perhaps surprisingly though, the United States takes third spot in our global ranking of absolute internet user growth.", "Despite already enjoying an internet penetration rate of 88% this time last year, internet users in the US grew by almost nine percent year-on-year, reaching a total of more than 310 million users in January 2019 (95 percent penetration).", "Meanwhile, African nations dominate the list of countries with the fastest growing internet communities, although many of these countries start from relatively small bases.", "Western Sahara saw the greatest year-on-year relative gains, with the reported number of internet users in the country increasing by almost five times since January 2018.", "Five countries saw their internet populations double over the past 12 months, while nine countries experienced annual growth of 50 percent or more.", "These annual growth numbers are already impressive, but an even more striking picture emerges as we take a longer-term view.", "We’re pleased to offer a whole series of five-year growth charts in this year’s reports, and the first of these – internet growth – tells a particularly compelling story.", "The number of internet users around the world has grown by more than 1.9 billion since our 2014 reports, an increase of more than 75% in just five years.", "This year’s total of 4.39 billion global users is also more than double the figure of 2.08 billion that we reported in our first Global Digital report back in January 2012.", "For context, it’s worth noting that the World Wide Web turns 30 this year. Although many people’s connected activities now rely on recent innovations like native mobile apps, the Web still represents ‘the internet’ for most users around the world.", "Data from the ITU suggest that it took roughly 16 years for the internet to reach its first billion users, but just another six years for it to reach two billion.", "However, the data in our Digital 2019 reports suggest that the internet is now growing at a rate of one billion new users every 2.7 years.", "That rate isn’t sustainable of course – at some point, everyone in the world who wants to connect to the internet will do so – but I wonder if Tim Berners-Lee could even have dreamt of the fact that his handy little tool for sharing research findings would reach almost 4½ billion people by its thirtieth birthday.", "The ways in which people use the internet are evolving quickly too, with mobile accounting for an ever-increasing share of our online activities.", "We’ll dig into the specifics of mobile and app use in the dedicated mobile section below, but it’s worth noting here that mobile phones now account for almost half the time that people spend on the internet.", "On average, the world’s internet users spend 6 hours and 42 minutes online each day. That’s down slightly on last year’s figure of 6 hours and 49 minutes, but our suspicion is that this drop may be in part due to the large number of new users who are still learning how to use the internet, and who use the internet less than those more seasoned users who turn to their connected devices hundreds of times each day.", "Despite the year-on-year drop, our online time quickly adds up. An average of more than 6½ hours a day equates to a total of more than 100 days of online time each year for every internet user.", "If we extend that average across the total internet user base of almost 4.4 billion users, we find that humanity will spend a collective total of more than 1.2 billion years online in 2019.", "The good news is that faster connections mean we’re achieving more in our online time. Ookla reports that average mobile connection speeds have increased by 18 percent since this time last year, while the speed of the average fixed connection has jumped by a third.", "Twelve countries and territories now enjoy average fixed internet connection speeds of more than 100MBPS, while ten countries enjoy average mobile connection speeds in excess of 50MBPS.", "Singapore enjoys the fastest average connections in the world at almost 191MBPS – that’s more than 50 times faster than the average connection in Venezuela at the other end of the spectrum.", "Iceland tops the mobile connection speed rankings, which may be one of the reasons why the country holds joint-first place in this year’s global internet penetration rankings.", "Interestingly, the average mobile connection speed exceeds the average fixed connection speed in 44 out of 117 countries and territories for which Ookla reports data, and the average mobile connection speed is more than double the average fixed connection speed in 10 of those countries.", "But what are the world’s 4.4 billion internet users actually doing online for those 6½ hours each day?", "As you might expect, Google continues to dominate the rankings of the world’s most visited websites, with both SimilarWeb and Alexa putting the search giant at the top of their tables.", "Alphabet’s ‘other’ big platform – YouTube – comes in at number two on both lists, while Facebook takes third spot.", "Social media platforms feature strongly on both companies’ lists, and it’s interesting to note that Twitter continues to show strong results in website rankings, despite its eroding user base (more on that in the social media section below).", "E-commerce sites have been steadily rising through the ranks of these lists over the course of the past year, and Alexa’s latest data puts 5 e-commerce sites in the top 20 ranking.", "Chinese platforms are particularly well represented this year, and it’s worth highlighting that both Taobao and Tmall now rank higher than Amazon in terms of global traffic.", "‘Adult’ sites continues to feature strongly in SimilarWeb’s rankings too, although Alexa’s data tells a slightly different story.", "Either way, the numbers all indicate that people spend a lot of time consuming adult content.", "That probably comes as little surprise, but the sheer amount of time involved may still shock you. Data from SimilarWeb suggest that, in 2019 alone, people will spend more than 1 billion days of collective human time on just the top 5 adult sites.", "Oh, and in case you’re wondering, the average visit lasts just over 10 minutes…", "More broadly, video is becoming an increasingly important part of our internet activities. Google searches for the word ‘video’ increased by 30 percent over the past year, and the query now ranks fourth amongst all global queries, behind Facebook, YouTube, and Google.", "[As an aside, if you’re wondering why people search for Google on Google, it’s all to do with using the address bar as a search input].", "GlobalWebIndex reports that 92 percent of internet users now watch videos online each month, meaning that more than 4 billion people around the world are consuming online video content in early 2019.", "For context, roughly 6 billion people around the world have a television set at home, based on data reported by the ITU.", "Games have become a huge part of the internet too, from simple mobile games to complex MMORPGs. GlobalWebIndex’s data also indicates that more than 1 billion people around the world now stream games over the internet each month, with games like Fortnite becoming global phenomena.", "People are spending an increasing amount of time watching other people play games online, too. The latest numbers indicate that almost a quarter of all internet users – more than 1 billion people – watch livestreams of other people playing games each month.", "Meanwhile, more than 700 million people will watch e-sports in 2019 – that’s double the number of people who watched Formula 1 in 2017.", "The ways in which people ‘interface’ with the internet are changing too. The use of voice control tools increased significantly during 2018, with roughly four in every ten internet users now using voice commands or voice search every month.", "Crucially, roughly half of all internet users in China and India now use voice control, and with these two markets being top priorities for developers, we can expect to see even stronger growth in the use of voice tech during 2019.", "Our full suite of Digital 2019 reports includes extensive insights into people’s use of the world’s top social platforms in more than 230 countries and territories around the world.", "These in-depth numbers tell a mixed story though, with some platforms showing impressive growth over the past 12 months, and others starting to lose ground.", "Worldwide social media user numbers have grown to almost 3.5 billion at the start of 2019, with 288 million new users in the past 12 months pushing the global penetration figure to 45 percent.", "Social media use is still far from evenly distributed across the globe though, and penetration rates in parts of Africa are still in the single digits.", "Countries in the Middle East top the social media penetration rankings again this year, with the United Arab Emirates and Qatar tied for top spot.", "In some cases, the individual platform figures reported in these countries actually exceed the total population figures published by the United Nations, but this is likely because both countries have significant expat communities that are not included in ‘official’ local population figures.", "At the other end of the scale, North Korea continues to languish in last place in the global social media rankings, with a penetration figure of less than 0.1 percent.", "This is perhaps unsurprising though, considering that the internet – or at least the internet as the rest of the world knows it – remains blocked throughout the country.", "We also suspect that the figures for Turkmenistan may actually be higher than those reported here, but we have been unable to source data from the county’s top platform (imo).", "African nations make up the remainder of the bottom 10 countries by social media penetration, and a number of countries across the region actually registered declines in social media use over the past 12 months.", "However, comparisons to total population are less representative when it comes to social media, because most platforms prohibit use by children.", "As a result, this year’s reports also include analysis of what we’re terming ‘eligible penetration’ – i.e. social media use amongst adults aged 13 and above.", "Considering that almost 40 percent of the total population in some parts of Africa is below the age of 13, this has a meaningful impact on the overall social media picture.", "The number of social media users around the world at the start of 2019 equates to roughly 58 percent of the total ‘eligible population’, but this figure rises to more than 70 percent in almost 100 countries around the world.", "In a number of countries, the total number of social media ‘users’ actually exceeds the total eligible population by a considerable margin.", "We’ve capped our eligible penetration figures at 99 percent though, because it’s unrealistic to expect that everybody in a country uses social media, and it’s also likely that some of these ‘users’ will represent duplicate accounts.", "Even when adjusted for age, however, social media penetration in many parts of the developing world still lags below 30 percent, and 16 countries around the world still register less than 10 percent eligible penetration.", "The good news is that many countries have shown strong growth in social media use over the past 12 months.", "Just as in the internet growth rankings above, Western Sahara posted the fastest social media growth during 2018, with the number of active users in the country increasing by more than 4½ times", "[note: in the absence of other data, we use active social media user numbers as a proxy for internet users in Western Sahara, which is why the numbers are the same].", "Ethiopia has also seen impressive growth this year, with an additional 2.3 million new users translating to annual growth of more than 60 percent.", "Encouragingly, Cuba has also witnessed strong social media growth this year, despite internet access remaining a challenge across the country.", "China added the greatest number of new social media users over the past 12 months, with the country’s total rising by close to 100 million new users since this time last year.", "The latest data suggest that more than 1 billion people in China now use social media, although we suspect that this figure is somewhat inflated by duplicate accounts.", "India also saw strong growth, with more than 60 million users signing up to social media for the first time during 2018.", "Meanwhile, despite a flurry of restrictions on social media platforms in recent months, the number of people using social media in Iran has also grown considerably in the past year.", "The team at Techrasa and local social media expert Niki Aghaei both concurred that annual user growth is well into double digits, and even official government sources have reported strong growth.", "The five-year growth figures for social media users are even more striking than those for internet use, with the global social media user total almost doubling since our Digital 2014 reports.", "This year’s total of 3.49 billion is also just over 2 billion higher than the 1.48 billion we reported in our first Global Digital report back in January 2012.", "The global social media audience has also matured considerably during that time, with people around the age of 30 now accounting for the largest share of the world’s social media users.", "Senior audiences are now better represented too, and Facebook’s various platforms report a greater number of users over the age of 55 than users below the age of 18.", "There’s still a meaningful gender imbalance across overall social media audiences too, but – as we’ll see below – this varies markedly at the individual platform level.", "In general, countries with the lowest overall social media penetration are also those countries with the greatest male skew.", "While these figures are specific to social media users, they’re likely representative of broader internet use too, which suggests that women suffer from poor levels of internet access in many parts of the developing world.", "As an essential resource for education, financial inclusion, employment and empowerment, ensuring more equal internet access for women must be a priority for the next phase of internet development.", "The amount of time that people spend on social media has increased again this year, albeit very slightly.", "GlobalWebIndex reports that the average social media user now spends 2 hours and 16 minutes each day on social platforms – up from 2 hours and 15 minutes last year – which equates to roughly one-third of their total internet time, and one-seventh of their waking lives.", "As with internet use, this time quickly adds up: if we extend this average daily time across all 3.484 billion people using social media today, we get a combined total of almost 330 million years of human time spent on social platforms during the course of 2019.", "It’s worth noting that the time spent on social media varies considerably across cultures though, with internet users in Japan spending an average of just 36 minutes on social media each day.", "At the other end of the scale, Filipinos continue to spend the most time on social media, with this year’s average of 4 hours and 12 minutes reflecting an increase of 15 minutes per day (6 percent) versus the average that we reported last year.", "The amount of time that people spend on social media each day has grown considerably over the past 5 years too, with the average user now spending 40 minutes – and 40 percent – longer each day on social compared to this time in 2014.", "However, not all of that time is spent ‘being sociable’. Data from GlobalWebIndex shows that 98 percent of internet users in the world’s top economies visited a social media platform in the past month, but just 83 percent actively engaged with – or contributed to – those platforms.", "Meanwhile, the average user now has an account on almost nine social media platforms, but they don’t necessarily engage with every one of these accounts each month.", "People are also increasingly using social media for work activities, with almost a quarter of users saying they’ve done so in the past month.", "If we extend this average to the total number of social media users around the world, the data suggest that more than 800 million people are using social media for work today.", "Despite a troubling year in 2018, Facebook maintains its top platform ranking in early 2019, and – contrary to ongoing media hysteria – there’s little evidence to suggest that people are leaving the platform in any significant numbers.", "In fact, Facebook’s monthly active users (MAU) numbers grew steadily across the past 12 months, and the platform’s latest earnings announcement reports year-on-year user growth of almost 10 percent.", "The platform’s five-year growth chart looks pretty impressive too.", "There are some signs that people are using Facebook less, however – more on that in a minute – but it seems that there may be a significant lag between what people say they’re going to do (#DeleteFacebook), and what they’re actually doing (“Oh! A Facebook notification.", "YouTube comes in at number two in this year’s rankings, but the world’s favourite video site posted some impressive new user numbers over the past year, and looks set to be the next social platform to break the 2 billion user mark.", "Current growth trends suggest that WhatsApp won’t be too far behind though, especially considering that the 1.5 billion number we’re reporting here the latest figure that the platform has published – dates back to January 2018.", "WeChat (Weixin in China) delivered another strong year in 2018 too, with China’s top platform joining the prestigious ‘billion users club’ over the past 12 months.", "That club now includes Instagram too, who revealed that they’d passed the 1 billion active accounts milestone back in June last year.", "Twitter had a disappointing year in 2018, and the platform starts 2019 down 4 million users versus this time last year.", "However, China’s Sina Weibo has proven that microblogging definitely isn’t dead, with the platform reporting user growth of almost 20 percent over the course of the past 12 months.", "If current growth trends continue, Weibo looks set to pass the 500 million user mark in the second half of 2019.", "Twitter isn’t alone in its suffering, though; the latest active user data from Snapchat shows that the platform’s user base is in steady decline, while the platform’s advertising audience has seen significant drops in recent months, as we’ll explore in more detail below.", "Looking more closely at messaging apps, Zuck and team continue to dominate the worldwide landscape, with the latest data from SimilarWeb showing that either WhatsApp or Facebook Messenger is the most-used app in 208 out of a total of 234 countries and territories for which they have data.", "Viber seems to have maintained its focussed popularity since last year, with the messaging platform the top choice for Android users in 10 countries across the globe.", "However, despite dominance in their home countries, both WeChat and LINE only top the rankings in 3 countries apiece.", "Before we take a closer look at individual platform numbers, it’s important to note that we’ve revised the way we report the more detailed social media platform audience figures in this year’s reports, so the figures that follow may not be directly comparable to the audience figures we reported in our Digital 2018 reports.", "For clarity, we now focus on the addressable advertising audience figures for each platform – rather than overall monthly active user (MAU) numbers – because these advertising audience figures are updated more frequently, and are easier to compare on a like-for-like basis across platforms.", "You’ll find the key headlines in the chart below, but read on for a closer inspection of each platform’s latest numbers.", "As we noted above, the cold, hard data show that Facebook hasn’t experienced any of the dramatic user declines that the media continue to portend.", "In reality, Facebook user numbers continue to grow around the world, with the platform adding 18 million new users to its addressable advertising audience in Q4 of 2018 alone.", "However, it’s not all good news in Menlo Park. Facebook’s advertising audience did lose 10 million users aged 13 to 17 in the last 3 months of 2018, although it made up for this loss with an equivalent gain in the number of users over the age of 55.", "With an addressable advertising audience of more than 300 million active users, India is now firmly established as Facebook’s top market, and the platform added 50 million new users in the country in past year alone.", "Users in The Philippines were up by 2 million in the past 3 months too, and up by 8 million in the full year to January 2019.", "So, what about the purported ‘mass Facebook exodus’? The latest figures do reveal some drops in the addressable advertising audience in some territories, but nothing like what the media would have us believe.", "What’s more, these figures need to be taken in the context of the broader growth story across Facebook’s total worldwide audience.", "To help you form your own perspective without clickbait and hysteria, here are Facebook’s “biggest losers” over the past 3 months:", "Rather than steep drops in user numbers, Facebook’s more worrying trend is falling engagement. We started to explore this story back in July, but the latest data from Facebook’s own tools show that these downward trends are continuing.", "The median number of posts ‘liked’ by the typical Facebook user has fallen by 10 percent in the past 6 months, and now stands at 9 per month.", "Perhaps even more worryingly for Facebook, the number of times people click on adverts on Facebook is also falling.", "The global median still stands at 8 adverts clicked per month, but the detail by gender shows that men and women are both clicking on fewer adverts today than they were back in July.", "However, the advertising revenue figures reported in Facebook’s latest earnings announcements continue to show steady growth.", "Our assessment is that Facebook’s ad-price bidding model means that, on average, advertisers are paying more for each advert, so the drop in the number of ad clicks has been more than offset by the incremental revenue that Facebook earns from each of those clicks.", "This hypothesis is borne out by the latest data from Locowise, who report that the number of Facebook pages investing in paid media has grown by more than 3 percent since October.", "This increase in media spend is likely correlated to the steady declines in average organic reach and engagement that we’ve been reporting in partnership with Locowise since our Digital 2018 reports last January.", "The latest data in this series show that average organic reach is down by 2.3 percent – or 14 basis points – since October.", "Similarly, average engagement with Facebook page posts is also down by more than 2 percent in the past three months, with fewer than 4 people in every 100 who see a Facebook page’s post engaging with it in some way.", "It’s worth highlighting that Locowise’s data represents averages across tens of thousands of different pages, of all ‘shapes and sizes’.", "So, because of the way in which we believe the Facebook algorithm works, larger pages will see much lower levels of organic reach and engagement compared to the figures reported above.", "For example, there are some clear differences when we compare results for pages with fewer than 10,000 ‘fans’ to pages with more than 100,000 fans:", "Once again though, these figures are averages across a variety of different pages, and the data show clear differences from one page to another.", "For example, the Facebook pages of popular celebrities tend to enjoy higher levels of organic reach and engagement than the pages of consumer brands with similar numbers of fans.", "Talking of large Facebook pages, Facebook’s own page is the most-liked property on the platform in January 2019, with more than 200 million ‘fans’.", "Samsung takes second spot globally, with the Korean brand’s fan page amassing almost 160 million fans by the time of publication.", "Just three consumer brands make it into the ranking of the top 20 Facebook pages though: Samsung, Coca-Cola, and McDonald’s.", "The rest of the list is dominated by musicians, sports teams and players, and actors. This should make for interesting reading for marketers, who need to see their activities and content in the context of the broader Facebook ‘experience’.", "These findings reinforce the fact that Facebook users aren’t going to Facebook just to see your ads (surprise!).", "People’s primary motivations for using Facebook remain staying in touch with friends and family, and these activities accounts for the lion’s share of the time that people spend on the platform.", "People do engage with brand content too, of course, but – with more than 80 million small and medium-sized businesses publishing pages to Facebook at the time of writing – it’s increasingly difficult for brands to stand out, especially as the amount of time people spend on the platform decreases.", "The key takeaway here is hiding in plain sight: people engage with the things that they’re most interested in.", "That might sound like a glib statement of the obvious, but marketers must recognise that no amount of Facebook media investment will make their content more interesting, or more engaging.", "The low-down: if you want to succeed with Facebook marketing, you need to give people more of what they want, and less of your brand’s corporate propaganda (you’ll find more on that at the end of this article).", "Our conversations with marketers all over the world in recent months indicate that Instagram will be a top choice for brands in 2019, so it’s worth spending a bit of time exploring what the platform’s audience looks like.", "We’ll be publishing detailed Instagram insights for more than 200 territories over the coming days in our local country reports, but here are the global headlines.", "Despite some leadership hurdles in 2018, Instagram posted some strong numbers over the past 12 months.", "Back in June, the company announced that it had passed the 1 billion ‘active accounts’ mark, and although the company later clarified that this figure did not represent unique users, the milestone was no less impressive.", "The platform’s latest advertising audience figures show that this strong performance has continued into 2019, with active users growing by more than four percent in the past 3 months to reach an advertising audience of 895 million active users around the world at the time of writing.", "However, this figure does not include user numbers for some countries that have sizeable Instagram audiences, but which are not available to advertisers as targeting locations.", "Perhaps the most interesting of these ‘unavailable countries’ is Iran.", "Despite regular speculation that it will be blocked in the country, Instagram remains one of the top social platforms in the country.", "The latest analysis from Techrasa and Niki Aghaei suggests that the platform now has more than 32 million users in Iran, which would rank it as one of twelve countries around the world where Instagram has passed 50 percent penetration of the eligible audience.", "Due to ongoing international sanctions, however, these 32 million users remain beyond the reach of Instagram advertisers, so we’ve not included it in the list below.", "Instagram’s user base may be less than half the size of Facebook’s, but Instagram has added more than twice as many new users as Facebook in the past three months.", "The platform saw its total global advertising audience increase by more than 38 million new users in Q4 2018, compared to Facebook’s growth of 18 million new users in the same time period.", "Instagram’s growing popularity amongst marketers isn’t just down to a growing user base, either; the platform also boasts a well-balanced audience profile.", "Globally, Instagram users are split roughly 50:50 between women and men, and – while the average age still skews younger than Facebook – Instagram has a higher incidence of users in the 18 to 34 year-old age bracket than Facebook does (albeit with a smaller total number of users in that age range).", "Instagram saw impressive growth all over the world during 2018 too, and it’s important to highlight that the platform has now become a global phenomenon.", "Of particular note is the platform’s growth in India, where Instagram added an average of one new user every two seconds in Q4 2018, amassing a total of 4 million new users since October.", "Instagram is also popular in a number of countries where Facebook has struggled to gain traction against local favourites.", "In particular, Instagram has gained a sizeable – and growing – audience in Russia, and this trend is mirrored in a number of Eastern European and Central Asian countries.", "Instagram’s advertising audience has now outgrown Facebook’s in 20 countries around the world, and we expect this number to increase during 2019 as Instagram’s popularity comes to the fore.", "However, it’s worth noting that the latest data suggest consumer brands still have some work to do when it comes to engaging their audiences on Instagram.", "Just one consumer brand – Nike – makes Instagram’s top 20 ‘most-followed’ list, with the remaining spots dominated by celebrities.", "Keen-eyed readers will also notice that the Kardashian clan account for four of these top 20 accounts, so Instagram will need to be careful to avoid triggering another Snapchat-Kylie-Jenner moment.", "2018 was less favourable to Twitter, who reported declines in global active users in their two past earnings announcements.", "This downward trend is clearly visible in the platform’s advertising audience numbers too, which indicate that Twitter’s total addressable audience has fallen by 1.5 percent since October.", "Twitter’s advertising audience also skews significantly towards men, with the platform reporting that almost two-thirds of its addressable audience is male.", "However, it’s important to compare these negative trends in active user numbers with some other, equally relevant data.", "Twitter has grown to become a platform of choice for various influential figures around the world, from presidents and prime ministers, to some of the world’s top journalists.", "Crucially though, observers do not need to have a Twitter account to access all of the content that these people post to the platform, and this is where some broader data provide a very different story of Twitter’s success compared to its earnings announcements.", "While the number of ‘registered’ users engaging with the platform appears to be falling, overall visitor traffic to Twitter.com has actually been increasing over recent months.", "SimilarWeb’s latest data suggest that Twitter.com attracted more than 670 million unique visitors in December 2018, reflecting month-on-month growth of more than 4 percent.", "These figures suggest that total visitors to Twitter.com are considerably more than double the platform’s total addressable advertising audience.", "These 670 million visitors also spend an average of more than nine minutes on the site each visit, so it’s clear that they’re not simply stopping in to read one or two tweets.", "Interpreting these numbers, it appears that Twitter’s primary problem isn’t necessarily the appeal of its platform, but rather its business model.", "Crucially, because people can access much of Twitter’s value without needing to log in, the company’s primary revenue source (ad placements targeting logged-in users) appears to be out of sync with the company’s primary asset (hundreds of millions of visitors, regardless of whether they’re logged in).", "My assessment is that this makes Twitter a highly attractive target for a media company who can make better sense of the potential value residing in these non-logged-in visitors.", "A Twitter acquisition has been on the cards for many years now, but my perspective echoes that of Professor Scott Galloway: there’s an increasing likelihood that Twitter will be acquired in 2019.", "Snapchat’s latest numbers tell an even more worrying story than Twitter’s. The company’s latest earnings announcements have shown steady declines in daily active users, but the company’s advertising audience figures show some even more precipitous drops.", "Snapchat’s total addressable audience sits at 306.5 million at the start of 2019, down more than 10 percent since October (note that this number is based on the figures published by Snapchat itself, in the platform’s own advertising tools).", "While it’s unclear whether the two numbers are correlated, it’s worth noting that the drop of 41 million users in Snapchat’s advertising audience over the past three months closely aligns to Instagram’s growth of 38 million users during the same time period.", "Furthermore, despite the platform’s existing female audience skew, Snapchat is losing male users faster than it’s losing women.", "The latest data reported in Snapchat’s advertising tools suggest that male users are down by almost 17 percent over the past 3 months, compared to a smaller drop in female users of 11 percent.", "However, Snapchat remains an important part of the social mix in a number of countries around the world, and – despite losing ground in these countries too – Snapchat still boasts a sizeable share of social media users in many countries across the Middle East.", "The story in Snapchat’s home market is less comforting, though. The platform has lost one in every seven of its US advertising audience since October 2018, and Snapchat’s total advertising audience in the country has now dropped below 100 million.", "My assessment of these numbers is that what previously made Snapchat appealing may also be contributing to its present declines.", "The platform has consistently appeared to focus on younger users – particularly those in the 13 to 24 year-old age bracket.", "However, people in these age groups tend to be more fickle in their social media behaviours, and while this targeted approach may have served Snapchat well in previous years, the platform seems to be struggling to maintain its appeal amongst its core audiences.", "Crucially, Instagram now boasts almost twice as many users as Snapchat in the same age bracket – and Instagram’s numbers are still growing.", "Furthermore, unlike Twitter, there’s little evidence in other data to hint at a remedy for Snapchat’s ails.", "The focused functionality of Snapchat’s platform was part of its initial success, but that focus leaves the company with fewer options now that the strategy seems to be delivering less favourable returns.", "So, once again, I’ll concur with the predictions of Prof Galloway: there’s a good chance that Snapchat will rethink its prior aversion to acquisition over the coming months.", "Fortunately, we return to good news in our analysis of LinkedIn. The world’s favourite professional social network delivered strong results over the past year, with the platform’s total addressable advertising audience growing by more than 3 percent in the last quarter of 2018 alone.", "It’s important to note that LinkedIn’s advertising audience numbers are based on total registered users, and not the monthly active users reported in other platform’s tools.", "However, the company’s latest data show that advertisers can now reach more than 600 million users around the world on LinkedIn, which tells a compelling story for brands hoping to connect with working professionals across the globe.", "LinkedIn has also seen strong growth across individual countries in recent months. The largest percentage change is in Myanmar, where the platform added roughly 80,000 new users in the past three months.", "LinkedIn has also delivered strong growth across many parts of developing Africa, but it’s worth noting that the overall audience sizes in many of these countries is still relatively small.", "LinkedIn is also growing in many developed markets, despite starting from a strong base. The company’s latest advertising data show that users grew by 14 percent in Japan in the past quarter, and by 13 percent in both South Korea and Singapore, despite the latter already ranking in LinkedIn’s top 20 countries by eligible penetration (note that we’re using adults aged 18+ for LinkedIn’s eligible audience, rather than the 13+ we’ve used for the other platforms).", "The world’s favourite video platform doesn’t share in-depth insights into its advertising audiences, but this year’s reports include some other YouTube data points that marketers will find useful.", "Much of this data points to the fact that music is the top draw for YouTube audiences, especially in the platform’s high-growth markets.", "Music-related topics accounted for half of the top 20 search queries for on YouTube during 2018, with users in Thailand searching so frequently for music-related content that the local word for ‘song’ – เพลง – appears at number 13 in the global top 20 rankings.", "Movies and ‘TV content’ accounted for much of the rest of the list, but it’s worth noting that the games Fortnite and Minecraft both attracted huge volumes of interest on YouTube throughout 2018.", "Music videos account for nine out of YouTube’s ten all-time most-watched videos, with Despacito amassing close to 6 billion total views by the time of writing.", "PewDiePie retains top spot in the global YouTube account rankings, but – as has been reported widely in the media, and to the alarm of legions of PewDiePie fans – he’s at risk of losing this mantle to T-Series, an Indian music label and movie studio.", "Unfortunately, WeChat, LINE, and VKontakte all declined our requests for more detailed insights into their worldwide audiences, so we’re unable to provide any richer insights for

January 2019.", "This figure brings worldwide mobile penetration to 67 percent – more than two-thirds of the total global population.", "Sadly, Google hasn’t published an update to its Consumer Barometer study in the past year, so we’re unable to report new data for unique mobile users by country.", "However, we do have all the latest numbers for mobile connections around the world, thanks to GSMA Intelligence.", "It’s worth noting that GSMA Intelligence has revised its figures since last year though, so the numbers in this year’s report won’t be directly comparable to those we reported in our Digital 2018 reports.", "In particular, the figure for unique mobile users we’re quoting this year is lower than the number we published last year, but – based on GSMA Intelligence’s revised dataset – this year’s figure actually represents growth of 100 million new users versus January 2018.", "The number of mobile connections around the world has grown by more than 4 percent in the past twelve months, reaching more than 8.8 billion at the start of 2019.", "However, the typical mobile user around the world now has an average of 1.73 mobile connections, so we must be careful not to misinterpret connections as unique users.", "The latest data from Ericsson suggest that smartphones now account for two-thirds of global mobile connections, indicating that almost 5.5 billion smartphones are in use around the world today.", "That’s a considerable change versus this time last year, with the latest data suggesting annual growth of nine percent.", "Compared to the same data for 2018, this equates to an additional 450 million smartphones in use today versus this time last year.", "Close to 2.5 billion ‘feature phone’ handsets are still in use around the world though, while connections associated with PCs, tablets, and mobile routers have reached 270 million.", "The percentage of mobile connections that can be classed as ‘broadband’ – i.e. 3G and above – has increased significantly since early 2018, with a relative year-on-year increase of more than 16 percent.", "Almost half of all mobile connections around the world are now 4G (LTE), according to reports from the Global Mobile Suppliers Association (GSMA), and the number of LTE subscriptions jumped by almost 50 percent in the year to July 2018.", "Three-quarters of the world’s mobile users pay for their connections via top-ups rather than paying by monthly instalments, down slightly from the 76 percent we reported this time last year.", "However, the picture varies from one extreme to the other across the globe.", "Total mobile connections have continued to grow steadily over the past 5 years, with operators activating more than 2.2 billion new connections during that time.", "However, with the rollout of new 5G networks over the next few years, industry experts predict that connection growth will start to accelerate as the demand for IoT connections increases.", "With roughly 5.5 billion smartphones in use across the world today, it’s little surprise that the mobile app market is booming.", "The latest data from App Annie show that app downloads increased by 9 percent over the past 12 months, reaching close to 200 billion total downloads for full-year 2018.", "What’s more, people are spending considerably more on apps too. App Annie reports that the world’s smartphone users spent more than US$100 billion on apps in 2018 alone.", "Comparing this against the number of smartphones in use around the world that Ericsson reports for 2018, this would mean that the average smartphone user now spends more than US$20 on apps each year, and this figure is even higher in more developed economies.", "Mobile games continue to dominate app stores, with the category achieving top spot for both downloads and revenues across both the Google Play and iOS stores in 2018.", "Many of the local reports in our broader Digital 2019 suite offer detailed insights into top apps by country, but here are the top global apps and games by monthly active users for full-year 2018:", "Perhaps unsurprisingly, this surge in app usage has contributed to a significant increase in the amount of mobile data we consume, too.", "Ericsson’s latest Mobility Report shows that the world now consumes more than 20 billion gigabytes of mobile data each month, while data in the company’s Mobility Visualizer tool indicates that the average smartphone device now consumes almost 7GB of mobile data every month.", "Still with me? Phew. I warned you this would be a long one.", "We’ll finish this year’s analysis on another high point. The latest data from Statista’s Digital Market Outlook studies show that e-commerce spend has grown by 14 percent year-on year, with the company estimating that full-year 2018 spend on consumer goods alone topped US$1.78 trillion.", "It’s important to note that Statista has revised all of its e-commerce data since our Digital 2018 reports, so – once again – these numbers will not be directly comparable to the figures in last year’s reports.", "However, the good news is that Statista has also shared updated data on annual growth, so we can still report detailed insights into annual growth.", "At 17 percent, Fashion & Beauty posted the strongest growth over the past year, with annual global spend in the category now topping half a trillion US dollars.", "However, online travel and accommodation bookings accounted for the largest share of consumer e-commerce spending in 2018, with users around the world spending a combined US$750 billion on online travel over the course of the full year.", "The number of e-commerce users has also grown considerably since last year, with Statista reporting that more than 2.8 billion people around the world now shop online.", "These shoppers are spending more money too, with the latest global average revenue per user figures (ARPU) up by more than 10 percent year-on-year to reach US$634.", "E-commerce penetration is still quite varied around the world though, and there is still plenty of room for growth in some of the world’s biggest economies.", "GlobalWebIndex reports that 74 percent of Indian internet users say they have purchased something online in the past month, but with internet penetration in the country hovering just above 40 percent, there are still hundreds of millions of people across the country who have yet to join the e-commerce revolution.", "Digging a bit deeper into the e-commerce data, we’ve compared the latest ARPU figures to GDP per capita, making it easier to get a sense of how important e-commerce is across different countries.", "The standout story in this comparison is China, where people spend more than 7 percent of GDP per capita online.", "Meanwhile, data from Worldpay’s recent Global Payments Report allow us to look at e-commerce spend in the context of broader retail spend.", "We’ve combined the figures Worldpay have reported for both e-commerce and offline point-of-sale spends to create a proxy for ‘total retail spend’, which we can use to understand e-commerce’s overall share.", "As you might expect, the figures vary considerably from one country to another, but those individual numbers make for insightful reading.", "It’s particularly interesting to note that – despite the strength of e-commerce in China – the country isn’t even in the top 10 in this list.", "Just before I conclude with some key forecasts for the coming year, I thought you’d like to know that the full Digital 2019 suite includes individual reports for more than 230 countries and territories around the world.", "To whet your appetite for those local reports, here’s a summary of the key headlines for each geography in our dataset.", "Don’t forget to read on below for those forecasts, though.", "Hopefully that extensive (!) roundup of key data points has given you a thorough grasp of digital today, but let’s finish up by taking a look at the year ahead.", "But this isn’t a predictions piece; rather, it’s an extension of the trends that I’ve been seeing in this year’s data.", "1. Voice control will increase in importance: the next phase of internet growth will come almost entirely from developing markets.", "However, as you can see in the chart below, many of these countries suffer from lower levels of literacy compared to the countries that dominate the internet today.", "As a result, global platforms like Google, Facebook and Amazon will look for more user-friendly interfaces to serve these new users, and voice looks set to dominate these efforts, at least in the near term.", "For clarity though, this isn’t a story about the rise of smart speakers in Africa; rather, it’s about a complete and revolutionary change in the way people interact with connected content and devices.", "2. The social landscape will evolve: with some of the world’s top social platforms losing users over extended periods, it’s likely that we’ll see some attrition and consolidation in the social media industry over the coming months.", "If current downward trends continue, we can expect investors in both Twitter and Snapchat to increase pressure on those companies’ boards to accept an offer of acquisition.", "At the same time, it feels like ‘the next big innovation’ is already overdue. However, this isn’t about the move to the ‘stories’ format, much as that will inevitably be one of the biggest stories in social media in 2019.", "Rather, my sense is that privacy concerns, changes in people’s social media preferences and behaviours, and broader fatigue with existing platforms will all combine to inspire a series of new social platforms in 2019, perhaps making use of new innovations like Tim Berners-Lee’s SOLID.", "This would fundamentally change the very fabric of business on the internet though, so expect to see plenty of resistance from the ‘Four Horsemen’.", "3. Marketing as a service: looking behind the scenes of the brands that achieve the greatest success on the internet, it becomes apparent that many of them share something in common: they treat marketing as a service.", "Rather than pumping out endless corporate propaganda and trite advertising, these brands use their marketing budgets to create things of value for their audiences.", "Whether it’s something as simple as a valuable how-to video on YouTube, or a large scale event that puts the audience at the heart of the action, this ‘marketing as a service’ is the only antidote to ongoing media inflation and the audience shift from newsfeeds to stories.", "If you’d like to dig deeper into the full collection of Digital 2019 reports, you’ll find every one of them for free in our library here on DataReportal.com, together with all of our previous reports from the past 8 years.", "And if this ridiculously long post hasn’t put you off the idea of discussing these themes with me in more detail, please feel free to get in touch with me on LinkedIn or Twitter.", "That’s it for this year, though; I wish you all the best for your own year of impressive digital growth in 2019, and I look forward to seeing you again, same time, same place, next year."]}

It is widely known that Netflix employs a “cost-plus” model, offering to pay upfront a show’s production costs plus a premium of 30%+ of the costs.", "Even after Netflix subtracts a distribution fee, outside studios are at break-even or in a positive territory from Day 1, versus having to deficit-finance series for the first few seasons on most traditional networks.", "But in exchange for the upfront payments, outside studios give up the potential upside that normally comes up with owning a long-running successful series, including off-network and international sales.", "Instead, Netflix’s deals include bump/bonuses after each season that are getting progressively bigger.", "While the payments are relatively modest after Season 1 and a little bigger after Season 2, I hear they escalate after Season 3, especially for series owned by Netflix — sometimes from hundreds of thousands to millions of dollars — as the studio starts to pay off the shows’ back-end.", "For series from outside studios, which I hear cost about 20% more than their Netflix-produced counterparts, I hear the built-in payment increases do not skyrocket as much but still are bigger after Season 3, Season 4 and beyond.", "Netflix is known for giving writers and producers creative freedom and has been relatively patient, picking up a significant portion of its freshman series for a second season, giving them time to find their legs.", "But as the shows’ prices start going up, the network tightens its renewal criteria.", "“It’s a combination of things. When we’re investing, we decide how much to invest based on the audience that will show up,” Netflix’s head of original content Cindy Holland said of the streamer’s cancellation decisions at the INTV conference in Israel last week.", "“If the audience doesn’t show up, we think about the reason to continue to invest in something that doesn’t do as well as we had hoped.", "Obviously, critical acclaim is important too, but we’re really about trying to stretch our investment dollars as far as we can and make good on our investors’ money – it’s theirs, not ours.”", "For the most popular shows, like blockbuster hit Stranger Things, renewals are a no-brainer as each new season is an event, driving viewership and subscriptions.", "(Being owned by Netflix, Stranger Things also is a money maker for the company, with auxiliary revenue streams such as theme park attractions and merchandising, including Halloween costumes.)", "But for everyone else, there is intense scrutiny. Netflix is unabashedly data-driven, with many of its decisions based on algorithms.", "That’s how the network reportedly switched from the initial (and traditional) 13-episode seasons to seasons of 10 episodes or less.", "Word is that those shorter seasons are considered optimal for consumption, and any additional episodes beyond 10 a season do not add value, so they are an unnecessary expense for the network.", "The same goes for the number of seasons. If a show has not broken out in a big way during its first couple of seasons, there has been chatter that Netflix does not see significant growth potential beyond Season 3 (and sometimes beyond Season 2) as viewers tend to move on to the next hot new show in an overcrowded TV universe.", "As for acclaim, I hear anecdotally that strong reviews from critics, which One Day at a Time has in spades, could get a show a second-season renewal at Netflix (but rarely a third).", "Beyond that, only major awards recognition counts because awards — along with strong word of mouth/curiosity — are thought to help drive subscriptions.", "Despite its acclaim, One Day at a Time, perhaps hindered by its multi-camera format, has not been able to land big nominations.", "I hear One Day at a Time came close to cancellation last year when the show’s producers and talent rallied fans in a spirited renew-the-show campaign.", "Netflix ultimately gave it a reprieve, but it came with a warning. Despite the fact that One Day at a Time’s viewership reportedly had grown between Season 1 and 2 and Seasons 2 and 3, word is Netflix brass claimed its numbers still were not where the network wanted them to be.", "I hear that, according to Netflix’s data, beyond Season 2-3, middle-of-the road series — even those with loyal fan base like One Day at a Time — would not generate significant new signups.", "But shiny new things will. Netflix’s strategy to grow subscription base is focused on introducing new series all the time, sometimes multiple ones each weekend.", "According to industry observers, fans of some of the canceled series would be disappointed by their demise but not upset enough to drop Netflix as there is new product coming out all the time that catches their attention.", "“At the core of their business is churn,” one industry insider said, noting that there are always subscribers who drop Netflix after a free trial period or a month or two later, and the goal is to get more people to sign up, which comes mostly thanks to hot new series everyone is talking about.", "As an asset, having 30 episodes of a series (three seasons) is considered enough to satisfy viewers discovering the show.", "Tacking on more episodes does not add significant value, I hear. “A show doesn’t serve a purpose [anymore],” an observer said.", "“There is no reason for the network to continue to invest in it.”", "That is why so many Netflix series are being outright canceled versus the streamer employing the oldest trick in every network’s bag: trying to renegotiate the terms of its deals.", "I have heard of instances when Netflix has sought reduction of previously agreed-upon fees and bonuses based on a series’ performance.", "For example, there was some back-and-forth between Netflix and Marvel TV, including the network requesting a season-order trim from 13 to 10 episodes, before the streaming giant pulled the plug on all Marvel series that it had picked up years ago at a very high price.", "(There were creative issues on some shows as well.) The first Marvel series were a big draw as they were among the handful of original series on the service.", "Two or three seasons in, the shows didn’t get the same attention because of the huge volume of new product.", "Netflix has built an adequate Marvel library, which will live on the service, while the Internet company cut a major expense by canceling the superhero series to invest in new fare.", "Additionally, like traditional networks in the era of vertical integration, Netflix has been ramping up in-house production, redirecting funds from outside productions to in-house series — including shows from its roster of A-list talent under rich overall deals such as Shonda Rhimes, Ryan Murphy, Kenya Barris and Shawn Levy — and thus avoiding the cost-plus surcharge it has to pay to shows from other studios.", "The shorter runs are something that’s spreading to other platforms, where shows also are ending relatively quickly.", "Amazon recently announced the upcoming fourth season of its flagship drama The Man in the High Castle will be its last.", "Only two original series on Amazon or Hulu — Amazon’s Transparent, which put that service on the map, and Bosch — have gone beyond four seasons, with the majority of shows canceled after two or three seasons.", "Industry observers see the trend also carrying over to premium networks, which now have a dual play as linear and SVOD outlets.", "“Fifty is the new 100,” an industry insider said, referring to the traditional milestone of 100 episodes that used to kick off a financial windfall for studios and profit participants from syndication and other off-network sales.", "It now is considered unattainable, especially on digital platforms, with 50 episodes pretty much the most you can get there.", "Added another source, “They are proving that they are not in the back-end business.”"]}

Her thighs and calves suddenly began to burn and throb as if her muscles were exhausted, as if she’d just run a marathon.", "And yet the 1.5-mile hike up to Mary Jane Falls in Las Vegas had been pretty easy. Angel and her best friend and their two dogs made it to the top in just under an hour.", "But when she started down the trail, her legs felt worn out and her knees were stiff, and each footfall sent a hot poker of pain from toe to hip.", "Simply bending her knee became increasingly difficult. After only a few steps, she knew she was in trouble.", "“I can’t go down,” she said to her companion, her best friend since high school. It was clear she was having another “episode.”", "That’s what Angel called the terrible bursts of muscle pain that had landed her in the hospital many times before.", "Give me your backpack, the friend told Angel. Can you lean on me?", "The two young women hobbled a few feet down the hillside. The trail wasn’t steep, but with each step, the muscles of her thighs and hips trembled, as if ready to give up completely and drop her to the ground.", "She tried walking on her tiptoes — sometimes that helped. Not that day. And resting made no difference.", "The young woman wept from the pain sharpened by the frustration that she should be made so helpless. She pulled out her phone and called her boyfriend.", "He, too, had been through this before. He’d be there as soon as he could.", "It took him almost hour to reach them. By then Angel’s legs were nearly useless. She could barely stand.", "He lifted her onto his shoulders and headed back down the trail. Although he walked carefully, every step sent daggers through her legs and up her back.", "Angel had suffered these episodes of muscle pain her whole life. When she was a child, everyone told her they were just growing pains.", "But one night when she was 14, the pain in her legs was so severe that it woke her. Sobbing, she called out to her parents.", "It wasn’t the first time she’d complained about her legs, but she’d never had such unbearable pain, and it had never occurred in the middle of the night.", "When it was clear the pain wasn’t going away, Angel and her mother ended up at Summerlin Hospital Medical Center on the outskirts of Las Vegas.", "The week before Angel had been sick with what her pediatrician thought was an upper respiratory infection and sinusitis, and she was treated with antihistamines and an antibiotic.", "She was still taking those medications when she went to the emergency room. In the hospital, she didn’t have a fever, but her urine was noted to be very dark — the color of tea — which meant that her muscles weren’t just painful from the exertion but had somehow been damaged.", "When muscle is destroyed, the protein that makes the tissue red can turn urine brown as it is eliminated from the body.", "The more of this protein in the urine, the darker the brown discoloration.", "The E.R. doctors looked for evidence of muscle damage by measuring the blood levels of another tissue component, an enzyme called creatine kinase (CK).", "Because there is always some breaking down and rebuilding of muscle, there is always some CK in the blood stream as it makes its way to the kidney for elimination.", "Normal levels are usually between 96 and 140 units per liter. That afternoon, Angel’s CK was over 24,000.", "The medical term for this kind of muscle breakdown is rhabdomyolysis, or rhabdo (from the Greek meaning the destruction of muscles).", "Rhabdo is generally not much of a mystery. It’s typically seen after some type of muscle trauma, such as a car accident or fall, or after a medical procedure like surgery.", "In these cases, the cause of the muscle injury is obvious. Less obvious but more common causes of rhabdo include certain drugs, both prescription and recreational, and alcohol.", "Extreme exercise can cause rhabdo, although it is usually mild. Certain infections can cause it as well.", "Angel was admitted to Summerlin for intravenous fluids to help flush the muscle-breakdown products out of her system.", "And so that her doctors could try to figure out why she had rhabdomyolysis in the first place. None of the most common causes seemed to fit.", "She was tested for an infection with the bacterium streptococcus (the cause of strep throat), which can cause rhabdo, but the tests were negative.", "When the rest of the routine testing was normal, her doctors concluded that she probably had some kind of viral infection that injured her muscles and caused the rhabdomyolysis.", "After a few of days, when her CK levels had lowered to a safer range and the pain resolved, she was discharged and advised to continue to drink plenty of fluids.", "Angel says she was told that it was very unlikely that this would happen again.", "And yet two months later, Angel had a second episode of severe muscle pain. Again, it happened in the middle of the night.", "Again, her CK was elevated, this time to over 60,000. And once again, it resolved with days of intravenous fluids.", "This time, however, it wasn’t clear what had caused her rhabdo.", "Although the “growing pains” persisted, she didn’t have to go to the hospital for the next three years.", "But in March 2012, when Angel was 17 and a senior in high school, she developed a fever and a sore throat.", "Although a strep test was negative, her pediatrician started her on antibiotics. The next day her muscles started to ache.", "The day after that her urine turned dark brown — the color of cola. And when the pain persisted for another day, her parents took her back, once more, to Summerlin Hospital.", "She was treated for her rhabdo, and this time a nephrologist (a kidney specialist) was consulted to make sure her kidneys would not be injured by the muscle-breakdown product.", "Repeated tests for strep were negative. She was also tested for lupus (more formally called systemic lupus erythematous) and for thyroid disease — each can cause rhabdo.", "The tests were negative. Infections other than strep can cause rhabdo, but they are less common. And really, nothing explained why this young woman would have three episodes of rhabdo in three years.", "Angel was supposed to follow up as an outpatient, but she ended up in the hospital again before that happened.", "This time she was seen by a neurologist, and because some of the tests suggested that her liver might be involved, a gastroenterologist.", "An M.R.I. of her brain was normal, and extensive testing for autoimmune liver diseases were negative.", "An ultrasound of her abdomen showed a gallstone but nothing that might explain her repeated bouts of muscle destruction and rhabdo.", "Angel continued to have episodes of severe muscle pain sometimes accompanied by dark urine for the next several years.", "They became more frequent. She had some pain almost every day, depending on her level of exertion. When her muscles began to hurt, she’d just take it easy, and the pain would fade away.", "But every three to four months, the pain would go wild. Sometimes it started after she exercised, but not always.", "It usually started in her legs, then spread upward to her back, her shoulders, her arms. She described it as the kind of ache you might get after working out too hard, only much worse.", "It would get to be overwhelming, as it had that afternoon at Mary Jane Falls, and her urine would again turn the color of cola, and she knew she had to go to the hospital.", "At the bottom of the hill, Angel’s boyfriend helped his sweetheart of the past three years into her friend’s car and drove to Summerlin Hospital.", "In the E.R., the faces of many of the doctors and nurses were familiar to the young woman after so many visits over the past eight years.", "She certainly knew the routine by now. Blood would be taken, intravenous fluids would be started and pain medicines would be provided.", "When the first blood tests came back, Angel said that the E.R. doctor told her that it looked like a mild attack; her CK was 18,000.", "They’d give her some fluids to help flush the muscle-breakdown products through her kidneys, and maybe she’d be able to go home later that night.", "But after a few hours of intravenous fluids, instead of the level going down, Angel’s level rose to more than 33,000.", "She’d have to be admitted so they could keep protecting her kidneys, she was told. By then it was late.", "She said goodbye to her boyfriend and was finally taken to a room where she could try to get some sleep.", "Some of the records from that admission are available, here.", "She was discharged after five days. By then her CK had dropped to near 1,000, and her urine was clear.", "She had kept up with her schoolwork — thanks to the help of some friends. But she knew that unless something changed, there was a very good chance she’d be back in the hospital in a few months with the same problem.", "Over the past several years, Angel has been admitted to Summerlin hospital well over 20 times. Most of the time, the doctors providing her care have focused on protecting her kidneys and managing her rhabdo, although several specialists did try to identify a cause for the repeated episodes.", "A muscle biopsy, performed to see if the cause of the rhabdo is contained within the muscle fibers, was done between hospitalizations; it was normal.", "A second one done several years later was negative as well. Additional efforts to identify the cause have been frustrated by the frequent hospitalizations.", "And while she’s been in the hospital, the doctors’ focus has had to be on managing the manifestations of the disease that took her there.", "Complex or unusual disorders, like this, are best investigated outside the hospital. Angel and her primary care provider, Heather Harris, however, have had trouble finding a specialist to guide them in this complicated work up.", "Moreover Angel confesses that for the past few years she’s been far too busy between full-time nursing school and part-time waiting tables to spend any more time thinking about her muscle problem than she absolutely has to.", "It takes time she just doesn’t have to make the appointments, see the doctors and follow up on the tests.", "But now, she’s worried about her kidneys. And she’s worried because she feels as if she’s getting weaker from all the muscle she’s lost.", "A recent visit to a neurologist at U.C.L.A. gave her some hope, but Angel is awaiting results.", "What do you think is going on here? Do you recognize this condition? Where should this patient and Harris, her P.C.P., look next?", "Enter your comments below, and I’ll let you know what happens in the case as it develops.

Both theaters chains have refused to screen films from Netflix due to their policies that require a minimum of 90 days between theatrical release and home viewing.[42]", "The film's eligibility for the Academy Awards was a matter of controversy, since despite its limited theatrical release, many believed it to have been made for home viewing.[43]", "In March 2019, Steven Spielberg expressed disapproval of streaming films being eligible for Academy Awards,[44] and the timing of his comments led many to believe they were a response to Roma, though he did not mention the film by name.[45]",

latter).", "One unique tactic included sending out thousands of six-pound Roma coffee table books (worth $175) to awards voters, which led a consultant to say \"the shipping charges cost more than some movies' advertising budgets\".[46]", "[edit]Netflix has not publicly disclosed box-office figures for Roma, but sources deduced that the film made $90,000–120,000 from three theaters in its

third weekend, the film made another estimated $500,000 from 100 theaters, for a running total of $900,000.[50]", "Despite being released on Netflix on 14 December, the film expanded to 145 theaters

all time on the site, and the best-reviewed of 2018.[58][59]", "In The Guardian, Peter Bradshaw wrote: \"Roma is thrilling, engrossing, moving—and just entirely amazing, an adjectival pileup of wonder.", "He has reached back into his own childhood to create an intensely personal story. \"[60] Manohla Dargis of The New York Times called the film \"an expansive, emotional portrait of life buffeted by violent forces, and a masterpiece\" and praised Cuarón's use of \"intimacy and monumentality to express the depths of ordinary life\".[16]", "Slavoj Žižek argued that people were appreciating the film for the wrong reasons, claiming that people were appreciating Cleo's grace without seeing how she must break free from the moral constraints placed upon her.[61]", "According to a study of 65 indigeneity-oriented fictional features produced in Latin America in the 21st century, the film can be considered as a catalyst for change in the blueprint for representations of Indigenous characters in cinema.", "Roma depicts Cleo, the main Indigenous character, with a level of detail that surpasses stereotypical portrayals.", "Gonzalez Rodriguez asserts that the film is a unique example of syntonic indigeneity, challenging traditional representations of the Indigenous Other as an exotic figure (histrionic indigeneity).[62]", "[edit]Roma won the Golden Lion for Best Film at the Venice International Film Festival.[63][64] At the Toronto International Film Festival, it was named second runner-up for the People's Choice Award.[65]", "The film received 10 nominations

Picture.[66] It is tied with Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon (2000) for the most Oscar nominations received by a film not in English.[67] It won three Academy Awards,[68] including Best Foreign Language Film, becoming the first Mexican film to win this honor.[69]", "Roma received American Film Institute's 2018 AFI Special Award,[70] as it was not eligible for AFI Movies of the Year due to its foreign-language status.[71] Time magazine and the New York Film Critics Circle named it the best film of 2018, and the National Board of Review named it one of the ten best films of 2018.[72][73]", "The February 2020 issue of New York lists Roma as one of the Best Movies That Lost Best Picture at the Oscars.[74]", "[edit]On 15 November 2019, it was confirmed that Roma would be receiving a DVD and Blu-ray release from The Criterion Collection, marking the first time a Netflix original film was added to the library, and one of the rare times that Netflix had permitted one of their films for physical media release.[75][76] Netflix described the announcement as \"such an honor\".[77] To coincide with the Criterion Collection release, in February 2020, Netflix released a

This is really fun. When we were discussing what episode to do for this one, we were like, okay, we're getting kind of towards the end of season three.", "We want to do like a big important, splashy episode.

That right. All right. Okay, so as we mentioned upfront, this is part one.", "We're going to cover Netflix from founding through about 2009 on this episode, part two. Next time we're going to go 2010 to the present, but let's start with the founding.", "So, as I was alluding to, most people know or think they know the founding story of Netflix. Nothing too controversial.", "We go back to 1997 a successful former enterprise software guy from Santa Cruz of all places, uh, is fed up with movie rental, late fees.", "Uh, these are the VHS days still and kind of sees the power of the coming wave of. The internet sees Amazon that's taking off, sees the potential to disrupt bricks and mortar retail and starts what would become Netflix and becomes himself, you know, Paragon of Silicon Valley statesman.", "Of course, I'm talking about Mark Randolph, not Reed Hastings. This is a truth. Statement, the illustrious CEO of Netflix, the illustrious CEO of Netflix was I, I texted Ben when we started researching this and reading Netflix.", "The parallels to Tesla here are like unreal. It's pretty awesome. So Mark Randolph, the reason that is true is he was the CEO of Netflix for the first year while Reed Hastings was finishing up a graduate school at Stanford.", "Yes, but really he was the founder and CEO of Netflix. I think it was closer to two, but we'll have to go through my notes here as we, as we dig through.", "Let me give you two other wild Marc Randolph facts from his background. One is that he helped to found Macworld magazine.", "Yes. Love that. And two is he is currently on the board of Chubbies shorts.", "Yes, yes. And um, Looker, I believe the analytics tool and, and liquor actually came out on Netflix, I think, which would make sense.", "Okay. So here is the official story. If you'll listen to Reed Hastings, he listened to Netflix, the, the official founding story, the lore.", "We're going to give you that. Then we're going to tell you the true story.", "So. Official story. Reed Hastings, he has been a successful technology entrepreneur in the enterprise space, and he has an epiphany for what would become Netflix.", "He's returning an overdue movie to his local video store. Now, originally, the version of this story that he would tell is he was returning it to a blockbuster.", "That gets changed not to a blockbuster after a lawsuit between blockbuster and Netflix. And you know how your founding story can just change.", "Yes. Just how can just not know. Just change whether it was true or not. We've seen this many times, so he's returned the movie to the local video store and he's so fed up.", "He comes up with this magical subscription model alternative when he's on a treadmill at the gym. This isn't just like, Lord, like I'm actually here.", "I'm going to quote from Reed Hastings saying in print to fortune magazine in 2009. Quote, the Genesis of Netflix came in 1997 when I got this late fee, about $40 for Apollo 13.", "Remember Apollo 13? So good, great film. Uh, I remember the fee because I was embarrassed about it. That was back in the VHS days, and it got me thinking that there's a big market out there.", "I didn't know about DVDs. And then a friend of mine told me they were coming and I ran out to tower records in Santa Cruz, California, and mailed CDs to myself.", "Just a disc in an envelope. It was a long, 24 hours until the mail arrived back at my house. I rip them open and they were all in great shape.", "That was the big excitement point. Another, another fun element on this story is the reason that he talks about being on the treadmill is because, uh.", "He also talks about how the gym memberships you pay monthly, whether you sort of use it or not.", "And he was like, Oh, I can totally apply that. It was like the very same day that I was upset about my late fee for Apollo 13 I happened to be going to the gym later thinking about their business model.", "And it's like this completely convoluted, apocryphal story invented purely to explain like what is the Netflix business model and what was the opportunity to be found.", "You know, we, we've talked about this a bunch on this show, but like, I actually don't think there's anything wrong with this because especially in the.", "Early days of a company, you need to communicate your value prop and stories are how you do that. So, um, you know, this is like this happened.", "Yeah. So, okay. What's the real story? One note as we dive in here, it is helpful to be familiar with Bay area geography when discussing, uh, Netflix.", "So for those of you who are, you will intimately understand this. For those of you who aren't, we will try and guide you along the way.", "So it was 1997. Reed Hastings was involved, but as also of course, was Mark Randolph, and they knew each other because they worked together at a company called pure atria, uh, formerly pure software in Sunnyvale, California, which merged with atria.", "Which merged with atria. Yeah. So what was, what was this company? Uh, it was a publicly traded company.", "It made bug detection software for developers, tools company. Ben, we should also say this was Reed Hastings.", "He founded this company also. He founded pure software and for Reed, this was his second job. He did a job for three years and then decided I'm going to start a company.", "David, I don't know if you're, are you going to touch on his, his background before starting pure. Not really.", "So go for it. All right. So, uh, Reed Hastings is like an unbelievable human being. So he went to school to join the Marines and ended up dropping out instead to completely flip tracks and join the peace Corps.", "And after we finished the peace Corps, went and took his first job, then his, his second job was starting pure, and in between, he did a master's in CS at Stanford.", "I think he went to Boden undergrad on these coasts. Um, but yeah, that's it. That's how we got out to the Valley.", "It was sort of predicated on a simple notion that he had around building a better debugger. He's starting to amass a large team.", "You know, they're, they're taking all this money, they're getting ready to go public. He tells the board, Hey, I want to not be CEO of this company.", "You know, it's kind of like, I think for the benefit of myself and all the other shareholders, we really should get a CEO right.", "The board says, no, you should remain CEO. And he ends up basically learning on the fly and then, you know, six successfully manages to both IPO this company and then merge it with atria.", "Such like the opposite of what was usually what boards were usually doing at that age, which was firing CEOs as soon as they humanly kid are firing founders.", "Okay. So. As Ben alluded to, pure atria. At this point, it's publicly traded. It's basically a rollout.", "They had acquired atria. They'd acquired a bunch of companies that are all in the space.", "They're rolling up and consolidating. Randolph. Marc Randolph had been at one of the companies, small companies that pure atria had acquired.", "Um, and after the acquisition, he read a, kind of, takes a liking to him and he gets promoted. He becomes head of marketing for the whole combined company.", "So it's 1997. One final piece of this roll up has happening though, and that's the biggest piece, which is there's a huge merger that's about to happen between pure and rational software.", "Um, which is the biggest competitor in the space. They've just announced they're going to merge public to public merger.", "It is actually going to be the largest merger in Silicon Valley history at that point in 1997 valued at just under a billion dollars.", "Yeah. Cute. Cute. Just under a billion dollars. Um, and Reed Hastings is finally going to get his wish.", "He's going to be fired as CEO, not fired, but he's, he's going to be redundant.", "He's not going to stay with the company. Uh, neither is Randolph. And it's interesting to note here. Uh, Hastings is really bummed about what has happened to the culture.", "And it's important to think about as we talk about Netflix later. Hasting says that pure, like a lot of these other companies went from being a heat filled.", "Everybody wants to be here place to a drone, ish. And I'm quoting here, when does the day end? Sausage factory.", "And he says, we got more bureaucratic as we grew. Um, and, and his. Thinking at that time is whatever I do in the future with the next thing I have to start, we have to think of systems so that we don't end up like that.", "And that will come back into play. Read is about to become hugely wealthy. Like he's still very young, hugely wealthy, and his plan is to basically ride off into the sunset.", "He's reapplied to Stanford, um, this time to do the graduate program and education, which is a fantastic program by the way.", "A lot of people do GSB and, uh, the education masters jointly Reid's going to go do.", "This when your grad program and education with the intention of he's going to become an education focused philanthropist for the rest of his life.", "Randolph though he, he's not so, you know, not about to become so wealthy, he, he has to keep working.", "So he decides what he wants to do is he wants to start a company and he really admires Amazon, which is public at this point, been around for a few years and he thinks.", "That there's a really good opportunity to do. Just like Bezos was thinking, he was looking at all the categories he could attack.", "He chose books. Randolph thinks, well, I can just use another category and run the same Amazon playbook, and it just so happens that in addition to working together, Reed and Mark both live in Santa Cruz.", "So this is, I said, Bay area geography is going to become important. Santa Cruz is a sleepy little university slash beach slash surfer town over the Santa Cruz mountains, which separate, uh, Silicon Valley.", "Uh, the Valley is on the. Inland side of the mountains from the Pacific ocean. Santa Cruz is on the ocean side.", "The mountains are awesome and it's beautiful, but like they're very high and it is very remote. Like if you live in Santa Cruz, you do not live in Silicon Valley.", "And it takes about an hour to commute back and forth. But just like the whole vibe is like beach town surfer town, not, not, you know, everything we think of is Silicon Valley.", "So as a result, Reed and Mark are often carpooling. Together, back and forth between Sunnyvale where pure is based and Santa Cruz.", "And so Randolph just starts like spit balling ideas with Reed during their car rides. He's like, what about this category?", "What about that category? What about that category?", "And he's convinced he wants to do this. So he starts a shell company. He calls it kibble inc because the idea is get the dogs to eat the dog food.", "So kibble inc dog food. Yeah. Anyway. Um, he starts a shell company. They're spitballing stuff. He starts thinking about, has been alluded to.", "He had also worked in the direct mail industry. That's how he got into marketing. He's presumably, we don't know this for a fact, but because of that, very familiar with the AOL prodigy, CompuServe customer acquisition techniques that I think we've referred to it in the past of a, just mailing out tons and tons of CDs to potential customers.", "I mean, how many. AOL CDs. Did you have mailed to your house back in the day? Oh my gosh. And the best thing was, every time you'd go to like a movie theater or something, there just be another box full of them at the desk, the whole country in like, you know, when would this been?", "AOL coasters fall somewhere now. Well, the important thing that I want to say about Aranoff here is it basically his background, but you know, before pure atria, he's a publishing guy.", "He knows the publishing industry inside and out and kind of stacked on top of that. He's a. Data and analytics guy, which didn't really exist in meaningful form.", "You know, there was no digital data and analytics then, so he was frequently tasked with things like serving audience and trying to understand who are our readers, his philosophy as he spitballing a lot of these different ideas here is thinking about.", "How can we automatically, probably through the user interface of some product, build a data and analytics suite, and how can we build sort of intelligence into the UI to automatically do things that make the experience of consuming better?", "It's funny to see all these different threads that become massive pillars of Netflix today, um, that are in sort of the backgrounds of these founders is that those become the pillars of, of Netflix from.", "Mark Randolph's history and background to Netflix today. So inspired by this, he hears about this coming new video format called DVD.", "It's just just getting launched. It's in the movie studios and electronics manufacturers are just rolling it out to being launched in a few test markets.", "Um, and of course DVDs. Come on. Optical disks that are the same form factor as a CD. And so Randolph's like, Oh, well, maybe we can, uh, mail these things.", "Um, so they do go, he does go to, um, a local record store and not tower records in Santa Cruz, uh, buys a CD, goes to a gift card, buys a, um.", "Very like large, like birthday card and stuff's the CD in it and mails it to Reed Hastings house. The next day or two when they're meeting to commute together.", "Reed's got the mayor, he's got the envelope and he's like, it came, it's fine.", "Did this, this blew my mind when I read this story. Today. When we think about the old Netflix, we're like, Oh man.", "It started in that era of DVDs as if it was so long ago. It started before DVDs and they had to proxy like, can we mail DVDs by mailing a CD?", "Because neither of them had ever touched a DVD before when they had this idea.", "I mean, talk about like being on the very tip of a wave and then a, and then sort of riding it the whole way.", "Like they were betting that DVD was going to succeed and that cause the, they evaluated what this work with tapes and they were like, Nope, shipping costs are too high.", "Shipping costs are too high, and just logistically like he got store them and cattle, like the CDs are tiny, although not as tiny as bits.", "So Netflix, it's, it's boring. It's off to the races. So, so what happens, read is like, great. I'm going off to Stanford.", "Um, but I've got all this money. I think I'm going to dabble in angel investing. Um, I'll fund this company.", "So, uh, just like Ilan did with Tesla, uh, Reed leads the first round of funding in kibble, inc, uh, which, uh, in a little bit becomes Netflix, read, invest $2 million.", "Randolph becomes, the CEO read is just an investor. And on the board, they recruit the initial team. They set up their first office in Scott's Valley, which is still on the Santa Cruz side of the mountains.", "Just a little bit. North of the town of Santa Cruz. And the idea is, yep, we're running the Amazon playbook, except instead of attacking borders and Barnes and noble, we are attacking blockbuster.", "It turns out that unsurprisingly, it's actually a pretty good idea. So the home video industry at this point is now bigger than box office for, uh, for film and television.", "Um, or I guess mostly film at this point. It's enormous. And the rental segment, so there's both sales and rental, uh, of home video.", "The rental segment is completely dominated by blockbuster.", "There's Hollywood video and a few others, but like blockbuster is that the 800 pound gorilla? I want to quote the here because for, for entrepreneurs out there who are listening, the moral of this story is you never get to stop justifying your market size to investors.", "It's going to be in your a pitch deck. And the second paragraph of the , and when Netflix goes public, first paragraph describes what they do.", "The second paragraph is in 2001 domestic consumer spent more than $32 billion on in-home filmed entertainment, representing approximately 80% of filmed entertainment, blah, blah, blah.", "It goes on to talk about exactly what David just said, that the largest portion is rental. I was reading the and I just chuckling that like.", "Did the story at any stage is always the same. What do you do? Why could it be huge? Why is your Tam then, how are you differentiated?", "The more things tuned, the more they stay. The same. Quick aside, because I think there's an important point here.", "This whole business of movie rentals. Is it in the first iteration of Netflix is business, and the blockbuster business is enabled by a Supreme court ruling around copyright law of what's called the first sale doctrine.", "Um, and it basically says that once you buy a copy of any copyrighted work, whether that's a book or a movie or whatever, you can then do whatever you want with it.", "You can resell it, you can rent it out like it's yours. You have then cleared the copyright that was established well before any of these businesses, but.", "The important point in here is that like regulatory issues and and lobbying and getting regulatory issues favorable to your business are very, very important.", "I feel like Silicon Valley now knows that, but for a long time and forgot that, and like this whole industry is enabled by a Supreme court ruling.", "And, and fortunately in a very sort of bayzos way where he basically always credits the infrastructure that was laid before him that allowed the company to exist, the internet, um, ups, et cetera.", "Like, you know, this wouldn't have been possible if what they had to do was go and lobby and get laws changed at the outset.", "Uh, infrastructure had been been laid for them. Go vote. It's important. Hopefully you already voted in these elections.", "Yeah, I assumed they had to pay some form of royalty back to the content holder every time they rented it.", "I mean, then blockbuster, like before Netflix comes along and you're just fat and happy blockbuster.", "That's kind of an amazing business. I mean, you buy this little store, it's not that big of square footage.", "You pay 15 to $18 or whatever for a movie, and then you rent it out for what? Like three, $3 and you run it.", "50 times or something. It's awesome. It's the same businesses scooters today. You know, you buy a scooter for 300 bucks, you rent it for a couple bucks per ride, and you do thousands of rides, and that's a good business.", "Okay, so they're getting started. Randolph goes to a conference in Las Vegas, the software and video conference.", "He meets a guy named Mitch Lowe who's going to come back into the story later. Mitch owns a 10 store video rental chain, small rental chain in Marin County.", "Just North of San Francisco. Again, Bay area geography.", "This is about as far on the opposite end of the Bay area as you can get from Santa Cruz. Uh, we're talking like two and a half hour drive with no traffic.", "Mitt is entrepreneurial. He owns these video rental stores, but he's also working on, uh, a software tool, a CRM tool for video rental stores and Randolph's like, Oh man, you are like the industry expert.", "Like I need you to come in. And like. Join the team. He eventually persuade him to do so. I assume it then moves from Miranda Santa Cruz cause you cannot do that commute every day.", "But he joined as the video acquisition chief, so he's now going to be in charge of like inventory and stocking and like what, what DVDs Netflix is going to buy.", "And so to kind of just like StitchFix like that we saw there like. Getting that early industry DNA on the team like really has a big impact together.", "They, and they'd hired a couple people from pure, a couple of folks that they'd worked with in the marketing department there.", "They all set on the settle on Netflix as the name, and then Ben texted me the original logo.", "We're going to have to tweet this and link to it in the show notes. Let's just say you don't want enterprise marketing people designing your consumer product, a branding and logo.", "I think, I think show notes can be a full HTML. So we'll just try and embed this image in the show notes.", "It is awesome. And the best thing is it was used for some really awful, it was 97 to 2000 and you know, Netflix on their next rev kind of nailed it and is basically the same logo they use today, except with a little bit of a nice brand refresh.", "But like the, the first one is . It's got this little like swooshy thing and it's very late nineties.", "Yeah. So it's purple. It was bad. Um, okay. Netflix. So what do they do? This is, this is brilliant. And I think this was driven by, by Mitch Lowe.", "DVDs are just getting launched. Like they're like. Most people don't have it. Player machines don't exist out there.", "How do they do like get their initial customers do initial customer feedback.", "They, they borrow a page, future page from me. They go online into product discussion, forums of enthusiasts for like.", "Movie technology and like DVD product forums, and they just started talking about Netflix there and like, people love it.", "So like 600 bucks, like getting a DVD player was like, Ooh, I'm like over 1000 bucks at this point in 1990 $7 so like the people who are buying these things are super techie, super early adopters, like the perfect market to adopt Netflix and give you no feedback here.", "Isn't it six 40 by four 80 like it's like, yeah, I think that, I think it might even be less. Like, you know, there's, it's for so research here, we didn't even go back and watch DVDs.", "Like, I don't, I don't have a DVD drive anywhere. I don't know if you do like, no, I sold my old X-Box", "and I have no, actually, I have no means to play any disks.", "Yeah, me neither. Well, wait, stay tuned for part two. Um. So they officially launch the product in April, 1998, November.", "They'd been building all this momentum and, uh, you know, early customer lists from these product forums.", "And it's just like they nail it. Like the market is still tiny, but like talk about product market fit on day one, the servers crashed.", "There's tons of demand. You could buy DVDs from them, right? Yes. You could both buy and rent. Yeah. Yeah.", "I mean, the magic that they came up with was the business model of rather than paying per DVD, you just pay a certain amount and then you can either keep two or three depending on what plan you opt into.", "But I didn't realize when they started, you could also just order DVDs from them and pay for them and keep them totally, uh, well, that part of the business is gonna come up again in one sec.", "The other perfect part of the timing here is like. The consumer electronics manufacturers were so powerful.", "This time we're talking Sony, Toshiba, Panasonic, like all these Japanese and some U S I forget which ones are us companies anyway, like these guys are dominant there.", "So, and they know that DVD. Machine's like that's their next drug that they're going to sell us consumers.", "Um, so they're pushing it hard, best buys, pushing it hard. Circuit city's pushing it hard. Netflix goes, and they do deals with these consumer electronics manufacturers to get Netflix promo coupons inserted into the boxes with DVD players, like talk about an awesome distribution act.", "Like it doesn't get any better than that. Uh, and this was a big part of their customer acquisition for many, many years, and it works like amazingly.", "The only downside is they're giving away a free month of Netflix, uh, as the promotion that ends up coming back to bite them in terms of that cost them a lot of money.", "Um, which we'll see in a sec. Blockbuster. While all this is going on, they're initially like, Oh, DVDs.", "That's like, nobody's going to use that. Like, you know, we're just going to stick with VHS. It feels shortsighted to me.", "In a different way than we normally rip on big companies that get disrupted. Like if you were to tell blockbuster at that time, streaming video on the internet will be the thing that ends you.", "Like it's not that surprising for me that they would scoff at that and like it just didn't feel like, it just felt like that was too far away.", "And when people actually do that and, but like just switching the size of the box. And like switching to a thing that plays videos better and like, come on, all electronics come down over time.", "How, how could they not believe that this was going to be a big change for their business? Well, okay,", "so let's be really fair to blockbuster here. So I went into research here thinking blockbuster. Oh my God, these guys are idiots.", "Like this is like. You know, classic case of corporate hubris getting disrupted, not the case at all.", "Blockbuster management until the very end is we'll see you is actually super competent and like really good.", "And the reason here that they didn't go into the market as fast as Netflix is, there was a format war, so DVD and Devex or battling it out against one another", "and it wasn't clear in the beginning who was going to win.", "Whoa. I forgot about Devex. Yeah. Devex um. That's like way lesser known that even like beta max or HD DVD or any of these alternatives, it was the beta max of of the, the optical disc era.", "So blockbuster was kind of waiting on the sidelines to see what would happen before they made the big bet and threw their weight behind it.", "Netflix bet the company on DVD over Devex. I don't know why. Maybe they just feel like, Oh, DVD, we'll go with that.", "Um, but fortunately it worked. Um, so that's ended up becoming like a digital, like a, not stream, but like fuck, it was like a files, like a filing coder format.", "And I used to have like a div IX player on my Mac that I could like play Devex files if I was downloading them from, uh, the back of a truck somewhere.", "And. Oh, the early two thousands so blockbuster isn't in the DVD game yet. Netflix is the only game in town.", "They've got promos in all the boxes with the players that are, that are shipping. The first four months after launch, they do 20,000 rentals.", "They're already at $1 million revenue run rate. Like that's super impressive.", "Even today, like start up, you launch here at $1 million revenue run rate. Four months in like super impressive and super capital efficient considering they were buying all these DVDs, like, I can't remember what did they, they had only raised the money from Reed to date, right?", "Well, capital official. Yeah. Yes, yes, yes. But with all this growth, like they are just burning huge.", "Like, like they're, they're, they're really in a rock and a hard place because they have to buy the DVDs.", "That's capital efficient. But the operations, this is why giving away those free rentals. The free month of rentals, which is going to end up being a couple, like they have to package these things in mailers, they have to ship them, they have to do all the labor to do that.", "They have to do the customer support. It gets really expensive to operate this, and the more you grow, the more expensive it gets.", "They realize that the. The Netflix actually had this perverse aspect of their business model and the DVD streaming era that their very best customers who use them the most cost them the most money.", "So they, uh, realized pretty early on before the streaming era, just before this in the DVD era. Because if you're constantly rotating disks in and out.", "You're costing Netflix a lot of money in operations to do that. So they, they figured out that they need to funnel customers to really obscure niches of like back catalog titles because those don't turn over as much.", "Like I might really love some like random thing. It's unlikely somebody else does. So I'm going to. Rent that keep it for a long time, and then I don't have other demand for that, uh, that unit.", "So that's how they start working on the recommendation algorithm and the personalization. As a result, it's not big new releases that drive Netflix in the early days.", "It's the back catalog. So Bollywood movies become huge. And this is funny. Um, softcore pornography becomes huge, as with all video formats, uh, the, uh, aphorism that pornography drives innovation, um, also true here.", "That's going to come back in a sec. So they raised the series a, there is a $6 million series a from IVP in August, 1998 to finance all of this.", "Reed is still finishing up at Stanford. He's just the investor, the angel investor. He's just on the board.", "He's not super involved. Uh, once he finishes his masters, he gets into, you know, education philanthropy as he wanted to.", "He also starts this thing called tech net. Um, which is a lobbying group for the technology industry.", "It's still the largest. Tech industry lobbying group. I didn't realize Reed Hastings started it like pretty cool.", "Um, so he starts that he's running that January, 1999 a couple things happen. One, there's some, uh, Reed is very liberal in his politics and other people in tech, at least at that point in time and still weren't, and they were like, you're running this lobbying group.", "You're very liberal. Like, I'm conservative. Like this should be more bipartisan. So. Reed ends up leaving tech net.", "He wants to get back into the entrepreneurial game. He's like, Oh, Netflix, my angel investment is kind of working.", "I'm going to go spend some more time there. He basically just shows up and announces like, okay, now I'm going to be co-CEO with Rand off here, and, uh, uh, ran off as apparently not super happy about this.", "But like, you know, the company's growing so. Okay. And read is great. So like everybody kind of gets along and they initially divvied up that Randolph's going to be in charge of marketing and content acquisition, and Reed is going to be in charge of engineering and ops.", "This is where Reed really starts building like a world-class technical team, technical and ops team at Netflix.", "I think this is the time when they actually name their algorithm, the cinema match, and they start having a company wide metric around, uh, .", "What percentage of the long tail of the DVDs are we actually successfully managing to get people to use their use one of their slots on?", "Yep. Yep. Obviously it will get into the Netflix, the challenge way later, but, um, this is really when it starts to become really in a lot of ways, pioneering modern data science and data engineering.", "Yup. And remember, they're still in Santa Cruz in Scott's Valley at this point. So reaches up and he's like, okay, a few things need to change around here.", "So one, even though they just raise this series a and they're still burning cash so fast because they're growing so quickly, they realize they need to fundraise again really quickly or like do something or they're going to go bankrupt.", "So the first thing that the board and Reed and Mark think is like. Oh, we said maybe we should just sell the company, like do a quick flip here.", "They, and who would be the natural acquire? None other than the inspiration for the company. Jeff Bezos.", "So the two of them fly up to Seattle, they meet with Bezos.", "This is a, this is 1998 still, I believe Bezos is like, Oh, you know, this is interesting. Okay. And Amazon is public.", "They've made some acquisitions at this point. Um, baseless is like, I'll give you $12 million to buy the company.", "Uh, which I assume must have been right around the post money for, uh, or maybe even less than the post.", "Of the raise that they just did. And Netflix is like, come on, like, no, we're not going to sell the company, but how about we do a cross promotion deal with you guys, where we've got this business where we're selling DVDs.", "Um, we're realizing that that's not super core to, to our subscription model. Um, how about we.", "Give you that. So whenever anybody on any Netflix customers want to buy DVDs, we'll just kick them over to Amazon to buy DVDs.", "Um, and an exchange. I think this happened to me once. Oh, really? I'm now like recalling it was in that era of Amazon doing these weird partnerships, like when as toys org us and target.", "Yeah. Yeah. Oh man. It's crazy. Imagining Amazon today doing some gigantic co-branded corner of their, their store like that.", "Seriously. Well, especially given what we'll see in part two with Amazon and video. So in return, Amazon is going to advertise Netflix on the homepage.", "Remember, this is the era of portals, which is now the most valuable real estate in technology.", "Crazy. So that happens on the back of that, they start fundraising and as they go out to fundraise, Reed is like, okay, like I'm the successful past entrepreneur here.", "I'm going to take over as the only CEO. I'm going to do this fundraise face of the company. I investors at this point need to bet that I'm going to do it again.", "Yep. He also, he's like. And we got to move out of Santa Cruz. We're going to move to Silicon Valley.", "So they compromise, they move to Silicon Valley technically, but they moved to Los Gatos, which is like as far South as you can possibly get in Silicon Valley.", "So probably another. 30 plus minutes South of Palo Alto and mountain view, I would say.", "And Netflix is still there today, and lots of people, especially as the company's grown now, live in San Francisco and work in Los Gatos and spend two hours a day on one-on-one commuting.", "Incredible is a good time. So it's a pretty special company to work for. When you think about why do people do this two hour commute?", "I'm actually not sure when this. Notorious deck, uh, started in his first revision. But the Netflix culture is extremely unique in the early days.", "And I don't know if the early days was right around this time or even earlier, Hastings decided that he needed to be able to communicate to new hires all the ways that they were very different and very opinionated in a culture.", "And he wanted to preserve this in a way that would scale because it didn't at his last company. To illustrate the point, there's two interesting things that all mentioned from Netflix's culture.", "One of which is that, uh, Hastings doesn't. Ever refer to it as a family. It's not welcome to the family.", "The more appropriate analogy is a sports team that we don't have unconditional love for each other.", "We have conditional love, we have really high standards, and it's a really high performing team. And to the degree that in a family, you can sort of love someone even if they're not a, a, an amazing employee on a team you don't.", "The second tidbit is that out of respect for everyone else on the team, they hold every seat to a really high regard.", "And so. You, you will be let go from the company if you are not performing really well. And it's not because they're punishing you for that or anything.", "It's out of respect to everyone else who is still at the company because they deserve to work with an a player and they say they take the burden on this and say, we were extremely generous with severance, but, uh, we're extremely opinionated that, you know, you need to be an extremely high performer to have that seat, otherwise you need to make it available for someone else.", "Out of fairness, I've always thought like. The way that all this is sort of like phrase, and they came up with this as so both opinionated and thoughtful and every little detail considered.", "Now a Hastings has released the deck on SlideShare, and I think it might be like the number one view, uh, deck on SlideShare meeting years ago.", "It was released on SlideShare and it's still a way, yeah. Yeah. And so like it was this internal thing that they evolved over and over and over, and then finally decided we should make this available for public consumption because it's a great recruiting tool.", "I mean, for the right set of people, like that's why you're off to a flame.", "Yeah, yeah. Yeah. So one of the things that makes them different, you see. Reads personal history and shaping reflected in this culture, like as all companies, right?", "Or like, like my partner Riley at wave is, uh, he always says like, company cultures are like, reflections of pure reflections of the founder, you know, personalities.", "And, uh, you know, read as a guy who was. And ROTC was going to join the Marines and then instead did the peace Corps and then, you know, went to Silicon Valley and became an engineer and then a CEO, and then a philanthropist.", "Like it's just all like these, this dichotomy, like baked in there. Very cool. In addition to all of those things, he is also a fundraising machine.", "Remember, he has orchestrated the largest merger in Silicon Valley history at this point. So basically every VC, and this is before the the.com crash, they're like.", "Oh, Reed Hastings, you're raising like, how much money can I give you? Um, he raises his, within a few months, raises $100 million or, or rephrased, uh, from our last, uh, LP bonus show.", "How large of a percentage ownership can I have in your company? Yes, exactly. And I don't care what the tech size is, right?", "You raises. Oh, $100 million, mostly from TCV. Uh, and we'll see. TCV ends up being a enormous shareholder in Netflix, um, and IPO and several other firms.", "David: One of the first hires he makes after becoming full CEO of the company is Acquired superhero -- who has shown up in at least one other episode, probably many more...", "David: Barry McCarthy, who he hires a CFO of Netflix. And Barry becomes critical to Netflix's success, then does his short detour at Clinkle before going to Spotify.", "Ben: Yeah, fast forward through that. Or DVD skip through that.", "Ben: So Barry's fame for folks who have listened to the Spotify episode is that he's the guy conceived of and then executed the plan for the direct listing, where Spotify did not actually issue new shares at IPO.", "David: Huge, huge hire as well as several other folks. They hired Tom Dylan from Seagate to run ops for the company.", "Remember, ops is super important here and then together this lead new leadership team, like they all kind of figured out like a sort of similar to Amazon and prime that delivery speed for rentals, movie rentals, when DVD rentals, when you order them is huge and that the faster they can get.", "From you clicking a rental online on Netflix to getting the DVD in your mailbox. That drives customer loyalty.", "That drives retention, but most importantly, that drives word of mouth and organic distribution. Like when you click rent magical, you get, remember this is 1998 99 you get that DVD in your mailbox.", "The next day you're going to tell all your friends. It's funny like how archaic it feels now, because now I'm like, how could it not be, you know, actually instant.", "But I am remembering, I'm trying to think what year it was. Probably 2000 it was the summer of 2008 cause I was doing my internship in, in North Carolina for Cisco and my roommates and I did a Netflix plan for our apartment.", "Uh, cause none of us were 21 yet. And so we were like, what do we do every day after work? And so we just got a really fat Netflix plan.", "And like. It was pretty amazing that like you, we'd hear about a movie from a friend over the weekend.", "We'd like click the button and then we were watching it Tuesday night and sometimes even Monday night.", "And it's, it's like, it's, it's funny to describe that as a magical experience, but it totally was. And this is all thanks to Dylan and McCarthy and, and, and read and then the rest of company of the company, of course.", "But they figured this out and they realized that this is the key. One of the key levers to their business.", "So they start building distribution centers, not just like randomly like, Oh, we're going to build them in big cities and geographical density.", "They start late. They get really analytical about it, like where's our customer base? Where's it growing?", "Where our word of mouth hotspots, let's build distribution centers close to them and get these DVDs to them as fast as possible and grow demand kind of organically.", "This way also helps them better manage inventory. Uh, everything. And then of course, this leads to the recommendation algorithm becoming super, super important.", "Did you ever manage your Netflix queue? I, I'm like remembering old features now that were like critically important to the service.", "Did you, were you, were you a subscriber back then?", "No, I subscribed way late. I'm not, I don't want a ton of movies, so, uh, it was, I was not the target market.", "I remember being obsessed and actually comparing my cue with friends. It was two things that were important to like compare with friends.", "One was like all my ratings, I'm like a completionist when Twitter was not algorithmic, I tried to read every tweet and I think I did between like 2009 and like 2017 and so like I tried to like.", "Ray, every movie I'd ever seen and find it on Netflix and rate it. And like the, I had a group of friends that totally prided themselves on doing that and being very opinionated about each of these movies.", "And the other thing that I definitely remember is I built up this huge queue that I was constantly adjusting of, like, which movies were going to be sent to me when and like how much did I want to prioritize moving something through the queue?", "And I thought, I mean both of those systems were just genius cause they were. I know Netflix wasn't measuring engagement, but engagement ended up being a proxy for how long am I going to stay a customer?", "And like both of those things like lit up my brain and all the right ways of, Oh, I have to go and update this piece of data on Netflix and lay the groundwork for.", "Netflix today and the streaming one real quick, funny aside, I mentioned pornography being a big part of Netflix in the early days read, uh, in 2000, he gets appointed to the California board of education.", "Uh, he's like, um, we need to get out of this pornography thing. So, uh, let's just, let's just, uh, that, that never happened.", "So another thing you will never find in Netflix history, but did drive a bunch of their growth in the early days.", "Okay. It's 2000. Growth is great. Everybody's high flying. High fiving, they got an a team, you know, built at the company.", "They file to go public and McCarthy is going to take them public. They have 120,000 subscribers.", "They're shipping 800,000 DVDs a month. Everything is great. But then the.com crash happens before, uh, before they can actually get out and get public.", "They postpone the IPO, but again, they're still growing and again, as they grow, they're burning all this capital so much so that they've burned through the a hundred million dollars that they've raised.", "Fortunately. The existing investors were so excited before the IPO, they wanted to buy in and get more of the company and get a pop.", "They invest another about $50 million before the IPO and before the crash. It turns out to be super necessary capital, but the crash happens and like, they're like, I don't think we can survive.", "Once again, they try and offload the company and sell it this time, not to Amazon. They go to. Blockbuster, blockbuster, and this is where blockbuster enters the story.", "So they go to Dallas where Blockbuster's headquartered Dallas, Texas. They meet with them and they'll like, you know, we need to sell the company.", "We want to sell it for 50 million, 50 this company's raised like 150 million at this point. Like, imagine if this transaction had happened.", "Blockbuster's like, eh, you seem kind of desperate. I don't think so. We're just going to crush you. Unreal.", "Absolutely unreal. Totally unreal. So for the companies that made it through the.com burst, you look at Amazon, you look at Netflix, you're like, wow, they were really smart, really good capital allocators.", "We're super nimble. We're able to make it through this. Like Netflix tried to get out. They were like, look, we'll just cut our losses and go be part of blockbuster.", "And again, blockbuster on not idiots. They're, they're really not. Like they. At this point, C DVDs, um, are already in the market.", "And they also see the online subscription business model and how good it is.", "They are like, this is why they don't buy them. They're like, we could spend $15 million on buying you or we could spend slightly less than that and just copy you and build you and use the blockbuster brand.", "And they build blockbuster online and which is a clone of Netflix. And it's really good. Like, you know, initially it's not so good and Netflix kind of makes fun of them, but like eventually, like it gets really good.", "The website was terrible. There's actually a really good a recommend, a friend of the show, a Caro over at Wondery.", "They did an episode, um, or a little series called business Wars was about Netflix versus blockbuster.", "And there's some Epic episodes in there about Hastings and the rest of the Netflix team.", "Sort of like loading up the blockbuster site when it first launches and laughing at how terrible the website is, and they can't even, like, they got Accenture to build it.", "They didn't hire their own engineers. And like. But they overcome it. They, they actually make it get, um, I mean, we'll think about this.", "It's Netflix, but if you actually want a video tonight, you can just go return it to blockbuster and then get a new one rather than waiting for this whole mail thing.", "Well, well that comes up in one sec. So initially, blockbuster online is a true Netflix clone. It's separate, separate business, separate office building from blockbuster.", "No attachment to the stories because they franchise the stores. So the franchisee owner of the store is, they don't want blockbuster online to be cannibalizing.", "Their business. So that kind of becomes an issue in a bit. Netflix though, they're like, all right, we can offload this thing.", "Well, I guess we're going to have to soldier through, so they do.", "This is what we're going to say these things, but like I want everybody to like really think about this.", "They do a 40% layoff, a 40% riff of the company. Four out of 10 people they lay off. Remember it just a couple months ago they were going to go public and everyone was high fiving.", "Having lived through my first two years in the working world of the 2008 recession.", "Like, I know what this feels like. Like bad times are bad. Like we have been in good times for the last, you know, 10 years.", "Imagine that like 40% of your coworkers just gone in one day and Netflix does this, but this is what they have to do.", "And the way that they did it too, he called a immediate urgent company meeting.", "They made this decision. He calls it an immediate company meeting and says. 40% of you are going to be laid off today.", "And then people go back to their offices to wait and see if their manager comes to talk to them or not.", "Harrowing, totally harrowing, but managed about as well as he can. And, um. You know, it's just like in times like this, it's either the company is going to die because you're going to go bankrupt, or you need to cut the burn.", "This is war time. You know? And this was also is interesting reading that Netflixed book. The way that Barry McCarthy sort of was looking at this as we need to do this.", "To prepare for the IPO, not only from a cash burn perspective, like we've got, I think they ended up IPOing with $15 million in the bank.", "Um, so they definitely needed that, that mezzanine round that they thought was just going to be to, uh, let those investors buy a little extra equity.", "But. It was really about a, what story were they gonna go tell the street when they, when they went into BPO in 2002", "yeah. And I think they weren't quite profitable when the IPO, but it was, they were on track to be profitable the next year.", "And you know, they needed to show that even if they were a very lean organization and they needed to be, to be in this.com burst era, that they could still execute their business.", "And also when it comes to this, I mean, like. So it's kudos to, again, a terrible moment, but like so many other companies would have been like, let's cut 10% then let's cut another 10% and like thousand cut your way into it.", "McCarthy and Hastings. They're like, no, we're cutting to the bone. We're doing it right now. This is one example.", "There's another example we'll get to in this episode, and then there's a third example that we're going to save for the second part of this, this Netflix set, but Reed Hastings and Netflix management are.", "Awesome at executing these. Like we made a decision, we're going to go hard at it. I know it seems insane, but we have very sound logic for why it needs to happen and it's happening.", "I'll foreshadow that the next two are related to, uh, either spin offs or spin outs from that. Indeed.", "Well, okay. Uh. The next year, it May, 2002 they finally do the IPO.", "This is still a nuclear winter for the tech world. Um, but they need the cash. They've gotten to profitability.", "They're like, we're just going to do it. We're going to go public. They raise 82 and a half million dollars in their IPO and a market cap of just over $300 million.", "So they sell over a quarter of the company in the IPO.", "Oh, I mean, like, can you imagine that these days it's like seven to 10%? Like, you know, like, Oh, well, and it's not, it's another not IPOing for $300 million.", "I know. I know. Crazy. Yeah. I joke to David and I message last night, like, wow, it's a really nice, a nice series B post IPO story.", "Seriously. Um. But the business is capitalized, and then, you know, they have no debt.", "They don't need to raise any more money, and they don't, uh, they eventually do take on debt, but I believe not until the streaming era.", "I think they did a tiny secondary the next month and just sold a little bit more in sort of a additional stock offering.", "But yeah, T to your point, no, nothing meaningful for awhile.", "Yeah, they're fully capitalized. So remember Randolph, the original CEO and a, and lo, the guy who was running the, the video stores in Marin.", "Now that the IPO has happened, they're like, okay, great. We're going to go focus on new things like initiatives within the company now, and they start testing kiosks, Netflix kiosks that they're going to put in grocery stores, and they're like, this is going to be a great new growth initiative, and Hastings and McCarthy, they're like.", "Yes. And actually Hastings at first agrees about the problem they're trying to solve. So an important detail is that Netflix is convenient in a way, because you don't have to leave your house, but it's inconvenient in a way that you can't have it now.", "Like they constantly were struggling with this existential problem of instant is not a part of our value proposition to date.", "And so, you know, this is sort of a. Um, lo and Randolph's brilliant idea of like, maybe, maybe this is the way to solve instead.", "Maybe this is the way to solve instance. Maybe it is, but eventually McCarthy and everybody, they're just like, guys, we just did a 40% riff.", "There are no new initiatives that we're doing right now. They kill and. And we'll wait before they kill it though.", "This is great. Uh, low and Randolph are so obsessed with this idea, the two of them. So they've convinced a grocery store, a single grocery store in Las Vegas at Smith's grocery chain to work with them to do this.", "And. This is so awesomely startup-y they decide it's not worth our investment in figuring out how to actually build a vending machine that's going to event DVDs.", "So we're going to task a Netflix employee to just stand there behind a little like kiosk. It's a store within a store after the checkout of the Smith's grocery store, and just like people can come and they will just do it manually and the employee will hand you the DVD, which is just awesome.", "And to oversee this. I know lo and Randolph actually got, uh, an apartment and move there for a month to kind of like be a part of standing up this operation.", "I mean, they were still awesome. It is awesome. Uh, as we will see. Um, but you can also understand why McCarthy in Hastings, like guys, guys, not now.", "The second thing that happened before they killed it is that, um. Lowe went and talked to the CEO of McDonald's and was basically like brokering a deal.", "It was like, then he came back to this guy freaking loved it. McDonald's was like, we want to roll this out at all of our, you know, a little extra revenue for the people that are hanging out in our stores.", "We're in and so low brings this back to Hastings and Hastings is like, are you freaking kidding me? Like our first brand impression with the majority of American that doesn't use us yet is not going to be in makeup.", "Donald's when they're waiting in lion like that. No, absolutely not. And so part of killing it was like, look, we don't have the head count for this.", "We don't, we can't split our focus like this. And now you're coming to me with McDonald's. All right, David, take the curtain off.", "What did this become and how did it become that? So Randolph and lo, they're demoralized. Netflix has changed so much.", "Randolph, you know, he started this thing, he was CEO, like, you know, it's, it's time for us to go.", "They go, Randolph gets full time into an investing, and as we talked about and liquor and all that low, he can't stop thinking about this kiosk thing.", "He's like, I'm gonna make this happen. He's like, I'm going to start a company. That company becomes red box, which child while she's out.", "An actual, very significant competitor to a Netflix.", "Yeah. I actually don't know what's happened to it now. Like, does it still exist in the streaming world?", "I think it is now part of something called outer wall, uh, which is, uh, they own, uh. Redbox, Coinstar, eco ATM, gazelle, a bunch of these other things.", "Outer wall stands for the outer wall of the grocery store and it was basically rolled up.", "I think it's actually a Bellevue based company. Yeah. Yeah. Cause Coinstar was in Bellevue. Yeah. Yeah.", "I think maybe Coinstar expanded to become outer wall when it rolled up. All this other stuff, something like that.", "But red box is now part of that, uh, that private equity family. Yeah. Crazy. Crazy. Um. Okay. So back to Netflix.", "We're now in March, 2003. Things are going great. The company hits a million subscribers. They announced this on their earnings call.", "Everyone's high-fiving once again, as we'll see, this doesn't last long. McCarthy. He's like, this is great.", "I've gotten landed the plane. I really want to go be the CEO of my own company.", "I'm going to leave by the end of the year and do that. But you know, I want to give everybody plenty of notice.", "Want to give the street notice. Um, so he announces that. Almost immediately afterwards. Blockbuster fully launches, they've been testing, they fully launched blockbuster online the week that they launch blockbuster online to the general public Netflix market.", "Cap drops is 60% in one week like a rock. And as we said, like it actually becomes a pretty good product.", "Plus they have all the marketing power of blockbuster. And so what happens is very quickly. All of the market going to subscription based online movie rentals, DVD rentals.", "Every new customer in America who came to do this. I had to do Netflix. Blockbuster gets 50% of new signups.", "So have new people coming into the market, which is where the vast majority of the market is still coming in.", "Blockbuster takes 50% share immediately. And if you think about that, the timing on this, so when, when Netflix IPO, they had 500,000 subscribers.", "It's an interestingly, not that big of a number on the number of movies. It was 11,500 movies, as they say in their .", "So. It's now 2003 Netflix is barely profitable. They just turned their first quarter profit. Blockbuster launches this.", "This is exactly at the the crest of the DVD wave where when Netflix is reporting earnings, sort of the quarters before blockbuster, they're like celebrating on the earnings call.", "Like. There is now $200 DVD players. America is buying DVD players. Our bet was right. This is just fueling our business.", "This is amazing timing. And so for blockbuster, judge, just nail it and launch it exactly. This time is like this.", "This a million subscribers that they have up from 500,000 at IPO is. You know, there's a, what, 200 million households in the U S or something like that.", "Like anything that happened before is irrelevant and what matters now as new signups in the future. Yep.", "Exactly. Not only does that happen, they've got a second problem, which they're even more worried about.", "They get word that Amazon. And they're one time potentially acquire is going to come into the market and is working on building a Netflix competitor.", "Remember, not streaming. We're still in the DVD rental market. They announced this. They're like, we gotta be honest about this with the street.", "They announced this on their Q3 analyst call that they think Amazon is coming. They're going to get ready for it, and McCarthy says, I'm not leaving.", "I'm going to stick it out in a fight here. He actually says, and I quote on the. On the investor analyst call, you don't leave your friends in the middle of a knife fight.", "It was just awesome. What a hero. Uh, and uh, uh, and he literally like swashbuckling comes rides back in.", "In an anticipation, none of of blockbuster, not in reaction to blockbuster, but in an anticipation of Amazon coming in.", "Cause I think Amazon's gonna follow the Amazon playbook and just undercut everybody on price. Netflix cuts their subscription price by almost 20% for the first time.", "It's like sub $20 for the, the big plan. Yup. Unfortunately, this turns into a full on disaster. A Amazon actually never ends up entering the market they do in Europe.", "Um, but not in the U S blockbuster sees this and they're like, Oh, Netflix is starting a price war. So now blockbuster and Netflix get locked into a price war and blockbuster further undercuts Netflix.", "And things go like haywire. Cause remember the cash burn cycle is super important here in blockbuster has a much healthier balance sheet at this point too.", "So blockbuster is like, wait, Netflix just cut prices. Why? Like we can outspend them. Okay. I guess we'll cut prices.", "Yep. Well they can in the Gantt as we'll see, so McCarthy and hasty, they'll like. Okay. We need to model out exactly.", "Because Netflix has a bunch, blockbuster has a bunch of debt from their old stores, and they used to be part of Viacom", "There was a whole complicated transaction. So yes, they have resources, but they also have debt covenants, so they model out in detail.", "What they think the blockbuster online business is, how long they think they can survive at this lower price, and with all the promotions they're doing until they trigger their debt covenants.", "And so they'll like, okay, we think we have about six months. David, can you go into what, what debt covenants are a little bit.", "Definitely. If you have debt, there are agreements on the debt called covenants that basically say you have to maintain certain financial, uh, health metrics of financial health.", "If you don't, if you trigger those debt covenants, then you.", "The lenders, the people who own your debt can put you into default and push you into bankruptcy. So it's like you don't want to do that.", "Now. You can go back and renegotiate with them anyway, lots of detail and all this happens with blockbuster.", "And just to drive the point home and put a super fine point on the, um.", "On the cash cycle here? Yes, there's been a million subscribers acquired. They hope to acquire another hundred million in the future.", "They're dramatically accelerating marketing spend to be able to bring people on at a faster rate every quarter than they had been before.", "However, since the first month is free, they make no money on people for at least a month after they acquire them and they're spending more money than ever before.", "To get nothing for that first month. So it's like, you know, to your point, that timing is tricky. Plus there's advertising dollars that you're spending to get those new customers.", "So what does blockbuster do? They run a Superbowl ad indefinitely. Like, Oh my God. Um, but they keep cool heads.", "We're still getting subscribers. If anything, blockbuster is just educating the market. They don't cut prices further.", "They don't get further drawn into the price war and it basically works because we will see here the, if Barry McCarthy is the acquired superhero, the acquired super villain.", "Carl Aiken of Marvel fame of a warehouses he showed up in our episodes so far, I don't think we've talked about Matthew is with Apple with wa like this guy.", "Oh my God. Hedge fund billionaire hold activist shareholder. He gets super involved with blockbuster.", "He buys about a 17, either 17 or 19% stake on the public markets in blockbuster starts agitating fire files.", "A proxy battle to basically at the blockbuster annual shareholder meeting to, uh, elect a separate slate of board directors that are all his cronies.", "He wins crazy. Again, blockbuster is actually like. Being smart here. Their management is actually pretty good.", "Carl, I can just like replaces the whole board with like I can cronies.", "He starts bringing his son to board meetings. Who's disliked. Some 26 year old dude, and he's like, you should give product Zane.", "It's insane. But for the black Western management, they managed to kind of like keep things on track and they decided with all this going on, they need to raise prices back up.", "Um, so Netflix and blockbuster both raise prices back up. The tide is rising. Both companies are coexisting here in the market.", "Things go pretty well. Netflix is still the leader. They end 2005 now they have over 4 million subscribers.", "They have a market cap of over a billion and a half. So up. What's that?", "Five X from the IPO. Three years ago they launched the Netflix prize in 2006 that you alluded to, which is we probably don't have time to cover it in it.", "Full detail here, maybe in the, maybe in part two, but super awesome. Get a ton of PR. Can any brilliant computer scientists out there beat our algorithm by, was it 10% 10% yup.", "Yup. Yeah. Everybody thinks that like it's going to happen very quickly. Ends up taking like three years before it finally does get a, it's 2009 I think when the, when the prize was finally awarded.", "But anyway. All this is happening. Blockbuster. Like they're still growing, but they realize like the bricks and mortar business is, is, you know, not long for this world online.", "And we're now in the mid two thousands, um, they really need to go all in. Management decides on online", "and they think, what is, what is the one thing we have. That we can beat Netflix on. They've realized that the turnaround time on rentals is super important, and this is actually pretty brilliant.", "They come up with this concept called that the market is total access, which is essentially you sign up for, yeah, this is a debit at the end.", "You sign up for blockbuster online, which is essentially just a Netflix clone and the, the extra that you get is.", "You can now return your movies to any blockbuster store and exchange them for your next movies at the store.", "So this is like what Amazon is doing with, um, you know, Amazon go and prime now, and like, this is actually like pretty visionary.", "It's risky because it does involve a lot of capital. A lot of ops. Um, you know, it's, it's like people are very skeptical that this could work, but if it does, Netflix can't match it.", "They have no physical footprint. Um, and blockbuster has stores all across America. Netflix is super, super scared when this happens.", "This is in 2006. So scared that at Sundance in the beginning of 2007, um, well, and they get scared, it actually makes a huge impact.", "So Epic's growth flatlines not only do they stop growing, they start losing subscribers. Uh, this has never happened.", "Like, remember, they've just been. Adding subscribers, you know, quarter after quarter, after quarter.", "It's like watching Snapchat or something. Totally. This is like, this is the Instagram stories moment.", "Um, and they're so worried. Sundance 2007, Reed Hastings meets with the blockbuster CEO and he offers essentially a merger of the two companies.", "And he says. Netflix will buy Blockbuster's online business from you for $600 million.", "So it'll be essentially like a, I guess what's that like two thirds Netflix, one-third blockbuster is the ratio.", "I assume it would be all stock and blockbuster rejects it. They were like, no, man, we got you guys on the roofs.", "We have a structural advantage you don't have. We're back in the game. And then history like turns on a knife point.", "This is crazy. Like blockbuster was gonna win. If they could execute this. But Carl Icahn, Oh my God.", "Oh my God. This is literally, this might be the worst self inflicted wound in like the history of business.", "This makes like the Uber thing look like child's play. Carl lichen and the blockbuster CEO get in right around this time, get into a huge fight over the CEO's annual bonus and such a fight that the CEO resigns and, and I can put him out.", "I can then hires a new CEO. This dude from seven 11 who this guy, and to be clear, this is icon scrutinizing the CEO's proposal for his and other executives bonuses and saying, Nope, I don't see why you should be paying yourself that much.", "Yep, exactly. And the blockbuster CEO is like, I'm like successfully navigating this.", "I'm about to beat Netflix. They just capitulated. They just offered a merger and I think I'm going to beat them.", "And uh, the, this guy who car-like and brings in, I don't even remember his name, it's not worth it. Basically, like, we try to be pretty even imbalanced on acquired.", "This guy is a total idiot. Like he is a complete moron.", "This is, this is like, he doesn't, he's, he says he doesn't believe in online businesses. This is 2007 like, it's pretty clear that online businesses are a thing.", "Google has been public for three years. Like, you know, this is insanity. He doesn't believe in online businesses.", "He, his plan. He's going to totally defund the blockbuster online.", "He thinks Netflix is a joke. Nobody's going to do it. Uh, he wants to bring back the heyday of bricks and mortar, wants to make bricks and mortar great again.", "He wants to attract a cold. David. He wants to attract the kids to come to blockbuster stores by selling pizza and soda at the stores.", "He calls it rock the block. God. It's like this is like a gift from heaven. If your jaw drop and be like, Whoa, we're saved.", "Here's the kicker. Here's the kicker. I remember this. I was working on wall street when this happened.", "Circuit city is like on the brink of bankruptcy. Uh, best buy does manage to survive this, but they're also at the brink of bankruptcy.", "Amazon is eating everybody's lunch. Again, online businesses, they work this, see this new CEO of blockbuster.", "He's like. We're going to buy circuit city for $1 billion. You literally cannot make this stuff up and always better than than than one failing business.", "You put two of them together. We're going to tie two anchors together and drop them into the ocean.", "Oh my God. It's ridiculous. Everybody. It doesn't actually happen because even Carl lichen is like, I'm not sure that's a good idea.", "Um, have you, have you been to one recently? Yeah. So basically everybody good at blockbuster who was running the online business.", "They just resigned. And it's crazy. Like in the book, they talk about the guy who was running the online business.", "He's really good. After all this happens. Rebasing calls him up and he's like, Hey, let's like get dinner and they get dinner and they talk about everything", "and then he invites him out to Netflix. He does like a town hall at Netflix and they talk about the whole history and what blockbuster online was doing with Netflix was going, it's crazy.", "They all resigned. We know what happens. Blockbuster goes bankrupt. All of the. Momentum they had around total access.", "It just dies. They defund the whole thing. Netflix wins, and it's amazing because like all of this again, once again, Netflix was at the brink of death.", "A miracle happens. All of the marketing, all the buzz around total access for blockbuster, that just brings so many more people of the mainstream in America into this market.", "They all go to Netflix. So by spring of 2009 Netflix now has 10 million subscribers. They're thriving.", "Nobody's canceling during the recession. They're on the top of the world. It's amazing. And that is where we're going to leave part one because there's another thing on the horizon coming.", "I thought Netflix was such a like stable, boring business.", "So not the case. You can't stay on your laurels for long because streaming is coming. What a good place to leave it.", "When we were going back and forth last night on where should we leave it? Should we, uh, should we go into Quickster now I'm really glad that we, uh, uh, this feels like such a good place to, to hang.", "Uh, totally. I just like. Circuit city circuit city. I read again like the worst, the worst. Um, alright.", "I'm emotionally exhausted, but we have other sections. Should we do narratives? Yeah. Going into narratives.", "I want to recap just a couple of things from reading the, the last night cause I think they're interesting.", "Um, so they sold 27% of the company in this IPO, raised 82 point $5 million, no net income, yet I'll only net losses, but about to have their first quarter of net income.", "The cap table is fascinating. So Reed Hastings owns 20% of the company, uh, which will get diluted down to about 15% after the IPO TCV technology, crossover ventures in two different vehicles.", "I, I'm pretty sure I'm reading this right, has 46% of the company. Yeah. Crazy. Pretty rare to see that at IPO, a single firm with different era ownership.", "Totally different era. You look at what they did there, they were able to, uh, to raise, you know, I think in that with including that second little offering close to $100 million, they made no real promises in their about sort of what they were going to do with that in any substantial way.", "They sort of just talked about they were going to spend on marketing. They were going to spend on improving the technology.", "They were going to increase the, the selection that they had. I mean, it wasn't like when we talk about what did they do with this, this capital, they run a flywheel business, so they just had to pour more money into the flywheel and have more money to be able to accelerate it.", "You know, in, in looking back, we, we tend to do these, this narrative section where we do bulls and bears, unlike other times like Facebook or like the net, the snap IPO, it's not like there were people running these articles of, of doom and gloom.", "I mean, it was pretty. Hey, this thing seems to be going pretty well.", "It's pretty disruptive. It's not clear if it's going to work yet, but they're IPOing and it's not a huge IPO.", "Well, to jump into the bear case here, all that's true. And like, yeah, I mean, if you really looked at it like.", "This was a really good business. I mean, there was potential headwinds in the future of blockbuster.", "It was one of the only tech companies, uh, cause people just watched all these dot-coms go bust. It was one of the only tech companies that was posting, you know, nice financials and was about to be profitable.", "I mean, there was like this huge, wow, it's a real business. You should buy it. Yup. But I think the bear case is, is, yeah, people are just still, so, you know, human psychology hangover from the IPO crash, they're all like, huh, this CEO like was the largest merger and you know, Silicon Valley history and the bubble era now, like you guys are losing money.", "And like, I don't believe in online businesses, you know? And also to be fair, a fair bear case was, I dunno, don't count out blockbuster.", "And as we've seen blockbuster very well could won here. Um, you know, hard to know. But yeah, the bookcase, like you said, like this is a good business.", "Subscription businesses like they could be a thing if, if they work, if you can get them to work, they can be very challenging to scale.", "But like, this is why cable companies are so good and cable companies will come back up in part two of the episode.", "Like if you can get consumers locked into paying you a certain amount every month, like you can. Build a very stable, very predictable, very good cashflow business around that.", "What would have happened otherwise? Let's do it. I struggle to find any other way that this could have worked out for Netflix.", "I mean, they either would have ended up part of Amazon and I'm not sure they would have maintained the brand part of blockbuster", "and they would have killed it. That would have been a terrible, yeah.", "Um. If they hadn't opportunistically raised some cash right before they thought they were going to IPO, then they probably wouldn't have weathered the storm.", "If they didn't IPO when they did, then they probably wouldn't be able to, um, properly fight blockbuster.", "Yeah. Just a lot of things went their way here. Company is, it's skill and luck. Yeah, totally. Totally.", "I think maybe there is a world where they could have kept it. Delayed the IPO longer, you know, they were at profitability and that would have been the wrong decision, I think because blockbuster was coming into the market and access to capital in the private markets didn't exist like it exists today.", "Yup, totally. Yup. They had to do this. Yeah, tech themes. Let's do it. The first one that I'm thinking of is like, and we've beat this to death on this episode, so it's not gonna be like surprising to anyone, but tabula rasa.", "If you come up to me and said, what wave did Netflix take advantage of to, to really launch them as a company, I'd be like streaming, but like, the fact that DVDs were a wave is still a little bit mind blowing to me that I did.", "It's just very, uh. I think how fast as humans, we forget the very recent past and what was a big deal and what wasn't is striking.", "Totally. And yeah, just timing, like not only a big wave, but like Netflix timed it so perfectly. Um, and this is why we ended up breaking this episode into two.", "The DVD. Part of Netflix and foreshadowing Quickster they really are two different businesses. Did you know you can still go to DVD?", "Oh, actually they'd say they bought the domain. Netflix has dvd.com can go and access their DVD offering there.", "Huh. Interesting. Yeah. Wow. I wonder, I mean there still are people who, I think they still have a few million DVD subscribers to this day.", "Interestingly enough, from dvd.com this is how muddle this stuff gets. You can rent Blu-rays. What about depicts alpha delpo?", "Um, okay. I have a couple. The biggest one though, we, we glossed over a lot of stuff as we had to in this story.", "Um, this is part of why we're doing our LP program and bonuses is to get deeper into like, who are the people that like actually build these things?", "And one of the decisions along the way that, like operationally helped make all this happen. But one thing that.", "Again, we didn't get to cover as much in this episode. That I think is an interesting theme, both across Amazon and Netflix, is that the people in finance and marketing, and we did talk about McCarthy and at Netflix, at these first-generation internet companies were so good.", "Like Barry McCarthy, joy Covey at Amazon, uh, Leslie Kilgore, who ran marketing analytical marketing at Netflix.", "Like we didn't get to talk about her, but there are so many people that are just like really, really, really good.", "They tended to come from, um, like the CPG world, like from Proctor and gamble. And I think that's where Leslie Kilgore came from.", "I could be wrong on that, but there are a bunch of these folks at Amazon, a bunch of these folks in Netflix, um, and they're just so good.", "And I feel like that's like a. That's like a piece of DNA that's now missing in the Valley is like this combination of finance and marketing, you know, and there's like growth, quote unquote, which is sort of the successor to this.", "But, um, cowboy marketing. Yeah. It's become so cowboy and it's become also just so dependent on Google and Facebook.", "Like, although the good growth, people would find ways and tell you that their way isn't right. And Google and Facebook and there's, there are still ways, there are still good people, but you know, this is the.", "Barry McCarthy modeling out Netflix, his online business to a T like he knew what month they were going to have to raise prices.", "The Netflix program with consumer manufacturers, uh, of, of, uh, consumer electronics manufacturers to put the coupons in the boxes and modeling out exactly what was that was gonna cost exactly what their growth rate was going to be.", "You know, the going population, um, subscriber center by subscriber center with the, with the one day delivery being driven by.", "Where word of mouth is occurring, like all that stuff. Like that's the company building stuff that bill Netflix into like a great business and Amazon did the same thing.", "I have two trends that I want to call out that were stated in the because one of the things you commonly see in these S ones is.", "It's an area called trends, but it's basically why should you believe that the wind is at our backs? And one is one that I hadn't really thought about that much, which was the very first one they call out as the shift to viewing in home instead of in theaters.", "And I had forgotten about this because this was like in the era, I think it was a little bit before the era where.", "Piracy really accelerated people, not going to movie theaters. But there was already a trend where people were like, gosh, why?", "You know, I can go rent it at blockbuster. Why would I, you know, I'll, I'll, I'll wait to see it on video and it'll be cheap on video.", "And this was killing movie theaters. But this trend was starting to accelerate. And that was one thing that they cited that it was like, look, no matter how people are renting movies, like they're watching them at home, and that's really helpful for us, which I thought was interesting.", "And the other that they cited was in a slightly different words, but the paradox of choice, that it was really hard.", "So there was one of two things will happen. You go to blockbuster and you're mad that there's not enough selection, or the movie that you want is out.", "Okay. If you go anywhere where there's infinite selection, then it's, it's too hard to choose what movie that you want to watch.", "But they had Cinemax and the cinema algorithm was really good at telling you what movie you probably want to watch next.", "And so they actually cited that as a sort of trend and advantage to Netflix in their, their S one to shareholders, which was interesting.", "And I've got a few more, but we're going to save those for part two. All right. Should we grade this and we're going to grade the IPO here.", "Yeah. So I was thinking about this and I'm like, okay, let, let's say they didn't, cause we've already covered, like they, they needed the IPO to have the cash to be able to win the war that they won", "and they were close to losing the war against blockbuster.", "So even that aside. Get, why IPO, what's the point of that? You've got the cash position and they're sitting in as 15 million in the bank.", "They're not going to be profitable this quarter, but maybe the next, and it's going to be super thin.", "So like you need cash from somewhere. Why does this business need cash and what is the flywheel?", "I think the flywheel is more spend, gets you more customers, which gives you. More leverage with content providers, which isn't really a huge factor in their business yet, but there are, there's gotta be some element of, yeah.", "Buying, you know, they're already buying DVDs in mass, so they sort of need to be able to do that to serve more customers.", "And you can buy deeper in the tail when you have more customers. They eventually do, do deals with movie studios as they get bigger, to buy DVDs at a discount.", "Yup. So that gets you more and better content, which then makes you able to, the inherently, that improves the product offering, which then lets you go get more customers.", "And so, I mean, it really, it's, it's a flywheel business that they're, they're raising cash to pour onto it.", "So competitive stuff aside, they should have just gone out and raised as much as they possibly could, have to be able to fuel that, that flywheel faster.", "I mean, it's not like they could have raised any more and it doesn't feel like the stock price could have been any higher given the macro economic climate they were in.", "So the way I look at this, they raise the most money they could, which was the good idea. Even if they didn't need it for competitive reasons, which they did it.", "It was a good idea timing wise and a an amount wise. So you know, it's not an a plus for me because those are reserved for exceptional circumstances, but this is a solid day.", "Yeah. I think. One thing I wanted to add on to the the flywheel aspect. We thought about this a lot at Rover actually, um, which is not a subscription business, but has some of the same dynamics with a business like this subscription business.", "Once you grow to a certain point, as you're growing, you're spending a ton of money on customer acquisition, bringing new people in, and as we talked about in the early stages of the market, so much the market has yet to come.", "There comes a point. Where you flip from all of that money that you're spending on customer acquisition.", "You're not making that back in terms of the revenue you're getting from your subscribers. You're spending more than the money you're getting back, but at a certain point in the market, in the adoption phase.", "That flips where you are now. You're still spending as fast as you can, but your subscriber space is so big, they're generating so much cash that you now like your economics tip over into the positive.", "Once that happens, you can super quickly go from like a, you know, cash burning business as we saw to like an incredibly, immensely profitable.", "Immensely big moat because for anybody else to come compete with you , they'd have to spend the same amount that you spent along the way to get there.", "Amazon could credibly do that, but nobody else could. And once Netflix did that, that's when. As far as the DVD business concerned.", "Oh, was concerned. Uh, that's when they tipped into like, we are an awesome business. It's very stable cash flows.", "It's the same thing with cable companies. This is how they work.", "Uh, or it worked. So yeah, I think it was like, they absolutely needed that capital to do that. I think, yeah, I debate a or a minus.", "Um, certainly a range because they needed to, they executed. It was great. They did what they had to do.", "It just, the market conditions were so bad that like. Selling that much with a company, like, you know, um, so not ideal, but I don't think they really had any other choice.", "So I don't know. A or a minus. All right. Carve outs. Carve outs. Okay. So mine, uh, I'll go, uh, quickly, uh, I can't believe it's taken me this long.", "To read and then recommend a N, K Jemisons SkyFii trilogy, the broken earth trilogy. These books are amazing, amazing.", "If you haven't read them yet, if you're a scifi fan, even if you're not a scifi fan, so three books in the trilogy, each one of them, the first one, when the Hugo award in.", "2015, I think. 15 or 16. The second one, one that you go where the next year, the third one, when the Hugo word the following year.", "So, so, so good. Um, and just like a perfect societal commentary for, you know, the era we're into where like, it's, uh, a persecuted people have an immense power that, uh, can save the world.", "Uh, but they're persecuted and like, so you have to give her anyway. It's really, really good. Must read.", "I have one. I had a list of articles that I've read recently that I thought were good, and then I was like, you know, I should do one that's just like something kind of fun.", "And I thought it was going to be completely unrelated to the episode, but, uh, I'm now realizing it's not at all.", "There's a Netflix show that I've been watching called the good place, and, uh, it's with Kristen bell.", "It is really goofy, but really good and really good, sort of just like. Popcorn, uh, you know, watch it for a half hour before you fall asleep.", "It's that, it's, it's basically like a heaven and hell, uh, thing where Kristen bell lands in the good place", "and she's looking around and she's like, Oh, cool, I'm in the good place, so I'm not in the bad place then.", "And she's like talking to the administrator of the good place and it's, it's just like, it's very tongue in cheek, but, um, really good.", "And, uh, uh, when I picked it, I didn't realize that it was a Netflix show, but, um, Netflix original content coming soon and in the, in the next episode.", "Well, thank you to our awesome sponsor of all of season three.", "Silicon Valley bank couldn't do the show without you guys.

In January, I decided to double-check my woozy memories and buy a ticket to see Shen Yun again, at Lincoln Center.", "After the purchase went through, I received a survey that asked me which of the thirty-six different versions of the Shen Yun ad that ran in New York—Newsday spots, Metro North posters, brochures in the mail—had convinced me to buy tickets.", "Shen Yun saturation has reached such a ludicrous intensity that it has, in recent months, become a meme.", "Part of the seeming strangeness of Shen Yun could be attributed to a latent Orientalism on the part of Western viewers—including those of us who are of Asian descent.", "But the real root of Shen Yun’s meme-friendly eeriness is that the ads brightly and aggressively broadcast nothing at all; this is why it’s so easy to imagine them popping up in Ebbing, Missouri, or in the extended Blade Runner universe, or on Mars.", "The ads have to be both ubiquitous and devoid of content so that they can convince more than a million people to pay good money to watch what is, essentially, religious-political propaganda—or, more generously, an extremely elaborate commercial for Falun Dafa’s spiritual teachings and its plight vis-à-vis the Chinese Communist regime.", "The Chinese Embassy, for its part, warns the American public to “stay away from the so-called ‘Shenyun’ performance of the ‘Falun Gong’ organization so as to avoid being deceived and used by the cult.”", "Whether Falun Dafa—the name is used interchangeably with Falun Gong—is a cult, in either a strict or loose sense, is debatable.", "Its practitioners have no record of violence, and the organization does not appear to be coercive. Its stated central values are “truthfulness, compassion, and forbearance.”", "The organization’s Web site notes that the “Falun,” meaning an “intelligent, rotating entity composed of high-energy matter,” is planted “in a practitioner’s lower abdomen from other dimensions” and then “rotates constantly, twenty-four hours a day.”", "Most of the group’s practices fall roughly within the traditions of Tai Chi and Qigong, and the group itself can be situated within China’s long history of apocalyptic sects promising redemptive transformation, such as the White Lotus Society, which dates to the Ming dynasty.", "Falun Gong was founded by a man named Li Hongzhi, who registered the group with the Chinese government in 1992.", "(In 1989, after the Tiananmen Square Protests, the Chinese Communist Party established a registry of social organizations, in order to head off political upheaval.)", "He soon attracted “tens of millions of adherents,” the political-science professor Maria Hsia Chang writes in “Falun Gong: The End of Days.”", "Falun Gong started holding enormous gatherings; by the mid-nineties, there were more than two thousand Falun Gong practice stations in Beijing alone.", "Troubled by the possibility that a large part of the population was becoming more loyal to Li than to the Communist Party, the government began cracking down on Qigong groups and banning sales of Falun Gong publications.", "By 1999, the government was estimating that the group had seventy million adherents; that year, more than ten thousand of them staged a silent protest in front of the central government compound, in Beijing.", "An arrest warrant was issued for Li, who had already immigrated to Queens, New York. The Chinese legislature subsequently passed, and began violently enforcing, an anti-cult law.", "Li has been open about his beliefs that evolution is fraudulent, that people of different races will be separated in Heaven, and that homosexuality and promiscuity are unnatural.", "He told Time that aliens were attempting to control humans by making us dependent on modern science. (He intended to be metaphorical, he later said.)", "A San Francisco man named Samuel Luo has claimed that his mother and stepfather refused essential medical treatment because of Falun Gong’s teachings that sickness is based in karma; he has also claimed that they came to believe that it was the gods’ plan to eliminate the gay population.", "Luo set up a Web site called The Untold Story of Falun Gong in 2007, and Falun Gong responded by complaining to the domain provider.", "The organization also threatened to sue the International Cultic Studies Association for bringing Luo to a conference as a presenter.", "Other religions resist modern medicine, and many faiths have held racist views or have opposed homosexuality (or both).", "But Falun Gong’s defensive reactions not only to criticism but to basic journalistic inquiry can suggest an institution that would prefer people not ask very many questions.", "In response to a list of questions related to this article, a representative from Falun Gong’s information center, who had previously clarified a few points over the phone, sent an impassioned, six-hundred-word e-mail expressing dismay at some of the details mentioned in the questions and arguing that negative stories about Falun Gong make it easier for the Chinese government to wage its campaign of persecution.", "The representative asked that he not be quoted at all. He did not answer any of the questions. (I separately requested comment, multiple times, from Shen Yun, but never heard back.)", "Falun Gong insists that thousands of its members have been killed in state custody, and three high-profile researchers—the journalist Ethan Gutmann, the human-rights lawyer David Matas, and the former Canadian Secretary of State David Kilgour—maintain that China has been harvesting thousands of organs annually from imprisoned Falun Gong practitioners, but many experts dispute this.", "(In 2017, a lawyer who has defended hundreds of Falun Gong members told the Washington Post that he knew of only three or four members dying in prison, and that he had never heard of organs being harvested from live prisoners, as Falun Gong claims.)", "The fact that both Falun Gong and the Communist Party communicate via propaganda makes it almost impossible to understand what’s really happening; a decade ago, the journalist Joseph Kahn, in the Times, described the rise of Falun Gong as “probably the most mysterious chapter in the history of China over the last 30 years.”", "Falun Gong members are genuinely persecuted in China, but stories about this have petered out in the press.", "And, in China, state censorship of dissent is growing. Under these circumstances, Shen Yun can be seen as a baroque and surreal last-resort call for help and attention.", "Falun Gong also has its own media outlet, a newspaper called the Epoch Times, which was founded in 2000.", "(The chairman of the newspaper’s board has said that it is “not a Falun Gong newspaper,” because “Falun Gong is a question of an individual’s belief.”)", "The paper skews conservative: among its recent pieces are stories headlined “Why We Should Embrace President Trump’s Nationalism,” “Government Welfare: A Cancer Known as Communism,” and “President Trump, Build the Wall.”", "It also is the world’s foremost purveyor of Shen Yun content, publishing such stories as “Excited Fans Welcome Shen Yun at Taiwanese Airport,” “The Vivid Storytelling of Shen Yun Symphony Orchestra,” and “Shen Yun Audiences Already Waiting for Next Year.”", "The article adds, “It might be a little overwhelming to imagine what it feels like to experience 5,000 years of Chinese culture in just two hours.”", "Aside from the organ harvesting, the homophobia, the anti-evolution ballad, and the Karl Marx apparition, the thing I found most odd about my Shen Yun experience in Houston was the hosts’ explanation of Chinese classical dance.", "This art form seemed to resemble both ballet and gymnastics, they said, but, they explained, ballet and gymnastics had in fact borrowed the traditional techniques of Chinese classical dance.", "The dancers were showcasing a tradition that was thousands of years old, they went on—a tradition that had been single-handedly rejuvenated by Shen Yun.", "It was impossible to see a show like this in China, because of the Communist regime, they told us.", "In February, I called up Emily Wilcox, a professor of Chinese studies at the University of Michigan and the author of the book “Revolutionary Bodies: Chinese Dance and the Socialist Legacy.”", "“I studied Chinese classical dance at the Beijing Dance Academy for a year and a half,” she said, “and, a few weeks after I came back to Michigan, a group promoting Shen Yun came up to me at the mall, handed me a flyer, and gave me the whole spiel about how Chinese dance is banned in China.", "It was hilarious to me, and so ridiculous, and, in a way, it inspired me to write this history in my book.”", "Wilcox told me that Chinese classical dance is one of the predominant forms of dance in the contemporary Chinese art world.", "“It’s the form that professional dancers pay most attention to,” she said. “And, crucially, it’s actually a very new art form.”", "In the early nineteen-fifties, Wilcox explained, Chinese dancers, driven by a nationalistic impulse to create a form that could truly represent China, and drawing inspiration from historic art objects, nineteen-twenties Chinese opera, and various types of folk performance, began to shape a new tradition.", "“Dancers in China emphasize the fact that Chinese dance is an artistic innovation,” Wilcox said. “They’re interested in the possibility of newness, diversity, finding something new in Chinese history rather than re-creating the same thing.”", "“Have you ever heard anyone say that ballet or gymnastics came out of Chinese dance?” I asked.", "“I have never heard that before, no,” Wilcox said. She then pointed me to several Chinese-classical-dance performances on YouTube, all of which were markedly more expressive and nuanced than what I saw at Shen Yun.", "In the book “Contemporary Directions in Asian-American Dance,” Yutian Wong notes that the glowing profiles Shen Yun publishes about its dancers “consist of stories in which former Chinese nationals can only discover the essence of Chinese culture by learning and performing classical Chinese dance choreography outside of the People’s Republic of China.”", "Shen Yun insists that it is a singular source of generative purity—that five thousand years of culture were reborn in upstate New York in 2006.", "Wong suggests that Shen Yun’s claims to purity are a way for Falun Gong practitioners to reclaim their identity from persecution—and that they’re bolstered by a preëxisting tendency on the part of Western audiences to perceive Asian bodies, and Asian culture, as “authentic.”", "On a freezing evening in early March, I took the train uptown for my second viewing of Shen Yun. I got to Lincoln Center early and began chatting up strangers.", "The crowd was heavily Asian; little girls with long black hair were running around in poofy department-store dresses.", "The first two groups I approached did not speak English. A fiftysomething man with a Turkish accent told me that he and his wife had come for his birthday.", "A stylishly dressed black couple told me that they usually bought tickets to Alvin Ailey for birthday celebrations, but this year they had decided to try Shen Yun instead.", "A white couple in their seventies from Long Island were also celebrating a birthday. I asked them all what they were expecting from the show.", "Dancing, acrobatics, beautiful colors, athleticism, “really traditional culture,” they said. I also asked what had prompted them to buy tickets.", "Some people mentioned the billboards, others the TV ads. “I get so many mailers at my apartment,” one person told me.", "Another said, “I saw that quote from Cate Blanchett!” (According to the Epoch Times, Blanchett saw Shen Yun, with her family, in 2011, and found it “exquisitely beautiful,” as countless ads since have proclaimed.", "A representative for Blanchett did not respond to a request for comment.)", "As the Epoch Times later noted, the theatre was full. When the curtain went up, white fog rolled off rows of smiling female dancers, and everyone gasped.", "The dance program was exactly what I had seen in Houston. The two hosts were identical to the previous hosts in manner and bearing, down to their pauses and gestures.", "They brought to mind hologram flight attendants on a plane that would never land. The vocal numbers, though, were different from the Houston production—instead of the song about atheism and evolution, a soprano in an evening gown sang a song that began, “Many today are far from the warmth of home / Separated by great distances from those they love.”", "It seemed likely that this was Shen Yun’s way of molding the production to local tastes; the other vocal number bemoaned the busyness of modern life.", "On the digital backdrop, the heavens were constantly opening up. The colors reminded me of early-two-thousands going-out tops, and Lisa Frank, and the glittery posters of fruits and vegetables that I used to see at the bazaar when I lived in Kyrgyzstan.", "Everything was as monotonous as a screen saver, until the hosts began talking about persecution. “There are people outside this theatre right now who were sent by the Chinese government,” the man said, setting the audience aflutter just as the dance with the organ harvesting began.", "At intermission, I looked outside for people who appeared to have been sent by the Chinese government—I didn’t see any, but what do I know?—and asked a woman selling Shen Yun merchandise what I might do if I was interested in joining Falun Dafa.", "“We recommend that you go to the Web site, where you can download teachings and exercise videos,” she said, smiling.", "“You know, everything you see in this show is true.” At the end of the show came Mao, the Communist earthquake, the hammer-and-sickle tsunami, and the enormous face of Karl Marx.", "A quarter of the audience started filing out of the theatre during the bows; others gave Shen Yun a standing ovation.", "“What’d you think?” I asked the man sitting behind me.", "“You know,” he said, pausing. “You know, I thought it was really, really great!” The expression on his face was one of compassion and forbearance but not necessarily of truthfulness—it was, I thought, the look of someone who, in about nine minutes, would be on the 1 train, wondering, as I have been wondering, how something could be so much more and so much less than what it seemed."]}

They were also shared and taught in certain classrooms and were purchasable at Scholastic book fairs.", "The series became a literary cultural phenomenon of sorts in youth literature in the early 2000s, and was considered to be an unofficial competitor with the Harry Potter series.", "The series' boom would eventually be followed with series such as Eragon, Twilight, and The Hunger Games in the same decade.", "Adding to the phenomenon to the success of the series were mysteries such as the anonymity of Lemony Snicket, due to his identity as Daniel Handler being unknown to the vast majority of people at the time, as well as the uncertain ultimate fate of the Baudelaires, leading to mass speculation and theorizing.", "Fans also had much hype towards the releases of The Grim Grotto, The Penultimate Peril and The End which had longer gaps in their release dates and these books would answer many plot threads.", "The popularity of the series was referenced in a 2005 episode of The Simpsons called \"The Bonfire of the Manatees\" and later in a 2006 episode of Arthur called \"Fern and Persimmony Glitchet\", showing how A Series of Unfortunate Events captivated both adult and child audiences.", "Although the first few books were criticized and notorious due to their controversial aspects, they gradually gained a cult following over the years as the series continued, leading to the 2004 feature film being produced only a few years after their initial launch, which boosted the popularity of the series further.", "This also led to a full Netflix adaptation of all thirteen books in 2017, which had a similar effect.", "Fans often claim the books are intelligently written, humorous, full of interesting plot twists, engaging mysteries, cliff hangers, complex characters, and themes which force the reader to question their own morality with heavy grey-on-grey morality.", "In regards to the children who read the series, the books have often been categorized as \"coming-of-age\" stories, and are in the \"Growing Up & Facts of Life\" section on Amazon.com.", "The Baudelaires go through a lot of character growth; they start off as wealthy and innocent and somewhat naive children who are dependent on their parents and after their parents die, the Baudelaires are unable to rely on their money and live in many dismal and impoverished circumstances.", "They gradually learn about the horrors and corruption in their world and, by the end, have become incredibly strong, brave, outspoken and mature teenagers.", "The Times Online refer to the books as \"a literary phenomenon\", and discuss how the plight of the Baudelaire orphans helps children cope with loss—citing the rise in sales post September 11, 2001 as evidence.", "A fan article compares the series to being a \"guide for grief.\"[1]", "The series can help teach children critical thinking skills, such as skepticism, as well as a wide variety of vocabulary.", "Others noted that it can help children to become more independent and learn how to not only voice their own values, but also act on them, due to the themes about the consequences of inaction and complacency, even when it seems the whole world is against them.", "In addition, the books may help to generate sympathy and understanding towards those who are unfortunate in life.", "The reader is forced to experience the constant tragedy of the Baudelaire orphans. For example, in The Austere Academy, the Baudelaires are forced to deal with bullying.", "A Series of Unfortunate Events has received its fair share of criticism.", "The series has been criticized for formulaic and repetitive storytelling. Similar events occur repeatedly.", "In Books 1-7, the Baudelaires appear with a new guardian, Count Olaf appears in a disguise, no one believes the Baudelaires, someone is killed or almost killed, and Olaf escapes.", "In defense, the formula being recycled makes The Vile Village and the latter books more dramatic. Another example of repetitiveness is that when someone says something, \"cried\" is often used as a descriptor, such as \"Violet cried, 'It wasn't us!'\"", "Lemony Snicket constantly defines words, even ones such as \"rickety\", \"blanched\" and \"simmered\". In defense, this is meant for the younger readers who probably do not have a large vocabulary.", "Handler appears to have taken this criticism seriously during development, in order to balance the story so younger readers know what is occurring, while at the same time, trying not to come off as too patronizing and condescending to older readers.", "In later books, definitions are moreso used in a fashion to describe the events that are unfolding, rather than the specific definition itself.", "Some claim and criticize that the books teach children to not trust adults and that it's useless to come to them for help.", "The series portrays young people (the Baudelaires, the Quagmires, Fiona) as being more sensible and open-minded than the often irrational adults, even going so far to include a nightmarish village run by 25 nonsensical elderly people (the Council of Elders), as well as Ishmael.", "However, another interpretation is that it teaches children to be wary of certain adults instead of all adults, and the idea of why blindly respecting and trusting someone, simply because they are older than you, can be a bad idea.", "A woman also once approached Daniel Handler and said, \"In one of your books, you teach that it is sometimes necessary to lie.\"[7]", "The books do not always portray \"honesty as the best policy\", showing how at times, not telling the truth is sometimes can be the better option, and why dishonesty can help.", "For example, the Baudelaires decide to build a trap for Esmé Squalor in order to rescue Sunny, but Quigley has a moral dilemma and decides to be honest.", "Esmé calls him an idiot for telling her they built a trap, and this begins a chain dangerous of events occur which almost leads to Sunny being thrown off a mountain to her death, because Quigley thought being honest is the \"right\" thing to do.", "The series contains elements of \"moral ambivalence\", often dismissing the idea of \"right\" and \"wrong\".", "For example, at the end of The Wide Window: Part Two, Klaus wonders if ditching Mr. Poe in order to catch a ride to Lucky Smells Lumbermill was the \"right\" thing to do.", "Violet replies that it does not really matter, what matters is what will happen to them.", "While the series features some developed characters, it has also been criticized for keeping some characters rather one note.", "Two developed villains are the Hook-Handed Man and White-Faced Women, who eventually change their ways and leave Olaf.", "In contrast, Esmé Squalor and Carmelita Spats are introduced as selfish and bratty and go through little character growth.", "However, one-note characters can be a positive thing, in the sense that they portray the truth that some people will never change.", "A Series of Unfortunate Events has come under criticism from both parents and some school districts for its dark themes.", "Upon its release, many were quick to deem the series as \"sick\" and \"demented\", due to the often overwhelming feelings of despair, children under constant threats of death and violence, people dying in gruesome ways, etc.", "This was especially true during the time when only books 1-4 were released, in which someone explicitly dies.", "The finale of book 5 is perhaps the first turning point of the series; while Duncan is being kidnapped, he shouts \"V.F.D.!\" which adds a heavy sense of mystery, and the series begins to introduce increasingly complex themes and heavier social commentary.", "Although book 4 had commentary about corruption in the workforce, the latter books contain social commentary on corruption in aspects like education (book 5), fashion and wealth (book 6), herd mentality (book 7), healthcare (book 8) and entertainment (book 9).", "Perhaps most controversial aspect was the suggested incest, referring to Olaf's attempt to marry his supposed distant cousin Violet in The Bad Beginning.", "Although his main motive is to gain the Baudelaire fortune and not sexual in nature, readers note that are suggestive lines.", "There is some low-level profanity used in the series. For example, \"damn\" and \"hell\" are said in The Reptile Room.", "Handler later commented that the word's use was \"precipitated by a long discussion of how one should never say this word, since only a villain would do so vile a thing!", "This is exactly the lily-liveredness of children's books that I can't stand.\"", "Since its release, access to the books have been banned and restricted in similar school districts; these include:", "- Katy ISD Elementary School in Katy, Texas, due to having \"violence/horror\"[8]", "- T.M. Clark Elementary in Portland, due to the extremely vague reason \"mysticism\"[8]", "- Decatur, Georgia, due to Count Olaf attempting to marry Violet[9][10]", "The books have drawn the ire and praise of fundamentalist Christians, some of whom believe the books to be Christian allegories and some of whom believe them to be long-winded insults against Christianity.", "Despite this, Handler, who is a secular humanist, and does not consider himself a religious person, claimed the books are not supposed to be Christian allegories or attacks on Christianity.[2][3]", "The Baudelaire family have been confirmed to be of Jewish descent, although Violet, Klaus and Sunny do not mention deities or \"God\", implying religious ambivalence.", "For example, when the Baudelaires encounter tough situations, they resort to brainstorming and using their wits, instead of prayer and begging a higher power for help.", "The End mentions the Baudelaires do not believe in magic:", "- \"The Baudelaires, as a rule, did not believe in magic... Like all people who have seen something of the world, the children had come across plenty of things they had been unable to explain, from the diabolical hypnotism techniques of Dr. Orwell to the way a girl named Fiona had broken Klaus's heart, but they had never been tempted to solve these mysteries with a supernatural explanation like magic.\"", "- Count Olaf has been seen as a parallel to Satan or some dark god-like figure. He is tall, has animalistic features that appear demonic, almost goat-like with his goatee and sideburns.", "He stalks the children mercilessly, is a psychopathic serial killer, and his eyes in his house make the children always seem like they are being watched.", "No matter where they go, he always seem to find them, implying omniscience. He is also involved with the secret society known as V.F.D.", "- In The Ersatz Elevator, the Baudelaires live at 667 Dark Avenue, which is one number away from 666.", "This may have been intended to foreshadow Esmé being evil, living one number away from a number viewed by many as being evil.", "- The Vile Village can be seen as a commentary on organized religion, cults and extremism, as it essentially contains a cult of old people who worship crows and want to burn people to death for not following their ways as part of their hive mind.", "- The Hostile Hospital can be seen as commentary on \"the power of prayer\", as the Volunteers Fighting Disease simply hope and tell the patients to feel better, but neglect actually giving them physical medicine like water and painkillers.", "- The End is often theorized to be an inversion of the Book of Genesis. For example, the Island is theorized to be a parallel to the Garden of Eden.", "Ishmael is theorized to be symbolic of God. During the story, Violet receives an apple which is a \"cure\" of a fatal disease from a snake, which could be interpreted as an allusion to Eve receiving the \"fruit of knowledge\" from the serpent.", "However, the islanders reject the apples, leading to their possible deaths.", "- There is a church mentioned in the series called the Cathedral of the Alleged Virgin, which is likely a satire of the concept of religion pushing beliefs as truth.", "When asked if A Series of Unfortunate Events is a \"world without God\", Handler replied, \"God is not a character in A Series of Unfortunate Events.", "The narrator mentions at one point that the characters often felt as if there was something powerful over them, which made no move to help them and was perhaps even laughing at their misfortune.", "But whether that person was God or the author is up for grabs. \"[3]", "A Series of Unfortunate Events consists of thirteen novels and and one epilogue chapter at the end of the series that is considered by Daniel Handler as a separate book.", "The series carries a unique feel, not only in content, but also in packaging.", "The original covers were made to look old fashioned, with Victorian designs throughout. They were originally released in paperback, but those have now become harder to find, with hardcovers becoming the standard for the series.", "Several hardcover box sets were released in the US. The first four box sets came with three books each, and were each referred to as \"A Box of Unfortunate Events.\"", "Books 1-3 were released as The Trouble Begins, books 4-6 were released as The Situation Worsens, books 1-6 were re-released as The Loathsome Library, books 7-9 were released as The Dilemma Deepens, and books 10-12 were released as The Gloom Looms.", "Shortly after publication of the last book, The End, the entire series was released in a box set called The Complete Wreck.", "The series's illustrator Brett Helquist returned to illustrate another release of the series in paperback form, made to mimic the penny dreadful--a common nineteenth-century British publication that was usually released in parts, each of which cost a penny.", "Books one, two, and three saw releases in this form, as well as secondary names: The Bad Beginning; or, Orphans!, The Reptile Room; or, Murder!, and The Wide Window; or, Disappearance!", "Penny Dreadful releases were never released for the remainder of the books.", "Numerous promotional items and merchandise has been released including calendars, buttons, dust covers, postcards, puzzles, board games and many more.", "An unofficial website focused on merchandise is here.", "There have been two major adaptations of A Series of Unfortunate Events: the Paramount film, and the Netflix series.", "While the film is not canon to the books, the TV series has debatable canonicity as Daniel Handler was involved with some of it, although he was taken off the development team, and many things in the TV series are different from the books.", "- Main article: Lemony Snicket's A Series of Unfortunate Events (film)", "The first three novels of the series, The Bad Beginning, The Reptile Room, and The Wide Window, were made into a film, entitled Lemony Snicket's A Series of Unfortunate Events, and starring Emily Browning, Liam Aiken, and Jim Carrey.", "The film was consequently adapted into a video game.", "The game is based primarily on the movie, which in turn is based on the plots of the first three books of the series:", "The Bad Beginning, The Reptile Room, and The Wide Window.", "Players take the roles of Violet, Klaus, and Sunny Baudelaire, solving puzzles, fighting villains and finding objects.", "- Main article: A Series of Unfortunate Events (TV series)", "On January 13, 2017, Netflix released a TV series based on the books.

Original scripted series climbed from 389 to 419 series in 2015.", "Based on a 6% year-to-year increase for the first six months of this year, the number will grow to 430-450 in 2016 and reach or slightly exceed 500 in 2017, he said.", "As can be expected, the growth is being driven by SVOD services, primarily Netflix, which currently has 71 adult, English-language scripted series, according to FX estimates, plus dozens of kids and foreign-language fare that is carried in the U.S.", "“When I pointed out the Peak TV phenomenon at the Summer TCA last year, I wrongly predicted that we’d hit the peak in 2015 or 2016,” Landgraf said.", "“It now seems clear that, at a minimum, the peak will be in calendar 2017–and there is enough inertial momentum here that we could well see the growth trend carrying over into the 2018 calendar year.", "Though I was wrong in my estimate of the timing—I don’t think I understood at this point last year that Netflix was going to try and compete with the entire MVPD system and all of its channels on a global basis rather than just, say, match the output of HBO— I WILL STILL stick by my prediction that we are going to hit a peak in the scripted series business within the next two and a half years- and then see a decline—by calendar ’19 at the latest.”", "“I’m NOT saying that I believe we are in a bubble which is going to pop, causing us to go from 500+ scripted series to half that number.", "Rather, I think we are ballooning into a condition of oversupply which will at some point slowly deflate, perhaps from 500+ shows to 400 or a little less than that.”", "Landgraf analyzed data on TV budgets and viewership to explain why the continuous growth is unsustainable.", "He said that the price for making and marketing an hour of television has gone up about 20% in the past 5 years, to $4-$5 million an hour.", "“You need a robust monetization to be profitable,” he said.", "He cited data that the top 20% of scripted series average 10.5 million viewers, the second 4.6 million, while the bottom two average 1.1 million and 380,000, respectively.", "“There is a really big, big difference,” Landgraf said. “You can pay for something in the first, second, and maybe third quintile (if you own it), but there just has to be a whole lot of shows that are losing a ton of money,” he said.", "Another reason that Netflix, the biggest driver of original series growth, would have to slow down — “They can’t double again and double again and again because the entire surface of the planet will be covered by Netflix shows in 20 years,” Landgraf quipped.", "Still, “there is more great TV than any time in history,” he acknowledged. However, “I also believe that there is so much U.S. television, we have lost much of the thread of a coherent, collective conversation about what is good, what is very good and what is great.”", "Landgraf also provided some info about FX and HBO’s programming budgets. “Our programming budget is approximately one-third of HBO’s and about one-sixth of Netflix’s,” he said.", "Since Netflix announced that it is spending $6 billion on original programming, that means that FX is spending about $1 billion and HBO about $3 billion.", "Landgraf touted the advantages of a “uniquely personal”, hands-on, detail-oriented approach to developing and producing TV shows that can only be done on a small scale (FX has 14 original series and the highest that it could go is 20-22, Landgraf said) vs. industrial-type production that focuses on volume.", "Addressing Netflix’s fast growing clout (The streaming service now offers more than 20% of the original scripted programming on U.S. TV), Landgraf spoke of Silicon Valley monopolies, citing companies with a dominant market position like Google.", "“I think it is particularly bad for storytellers and our culture if one company will be able to seize 40% of storytelling,” he said.", "While Landgraf has been critical of Netflix over the years, FX recently licensed The People v. OJ Simpson to the streaming giant.", "Landgraf praised Netflix for giving FX brand recognition for its programming, something he had complained about in the past.", "“Ultimately, running a business is a practical process as much as it is a philosophical one,” he said.", "“It was an unprecedented deal.” He noted that the sale made financial sense for the studios and profit participants behind the show."]}

On a day when the Apple Watch and other gear attracted massive attention, Plepler drew some of the biggest applause by announcing that HBO Now, the $15 a month, stand-alone SVOD service, would debut on Apple TV just in time for April's season five premiere of Game of Thrones.", "(Cablevision followed a week later with word its cable systems would also offer the service.)", "The ovation for HBO Now followed similar pomp around SVOD services known as \"OTTs\" for their ability to go \"over-the-top,\" circumventing distributors to connect directly with consumers.", "In fact, just about every network is in various stages of aggressive SVOD development. Showtime plans an offering close on HBO's heels; Nickelodeon plans a Noggin-branded library play; and NBCUniversal has a comedy service for the Jimmy Fallon generation on tap.", "(In a different part of the over-the-top universe, Apple itself is poised to become a virtual multichannel video programming distributor [MVPD], offering a number of channels without the television connection.", "Apple is supposedly assembling a \"skinny bundle\" of some 25 channels it will offer consumers for $30 to $40 a month—including broadcast networks like ABC, CBS, and Fox.", "Dish Network and others are already offering a Sling TV bundle of channels such as ESPN and HGTV for $20 a month.", "And Sony's PlayStation Vue has also entered the fray.)", "All of this eager positioning attests to the disruptive allure of SVOD among consumers. It's the sense that anyone with an iPad, an Internet connection, and a few bucks for a subscription can foil the bundle merchants at cable, satellite, and telecom companies charging rates of $100 or more per month.", "HBO's agenda-setting move, fast-tracked last fall, came despite the 43-year-old cable network's need to vigilantly maintain diplomatic ties with traditional distributors, whose greatest fear is that consumers will decide they no longer need them.", "(Though the fact that they control more than three-quarters of U.S. broadband service may explain why they could abide HBO Now.)", "\"This is a transformative moment for HBO,\" Plepler declared from the stage. Slight correction: These are transformative times, all right, but for the entire entertainment business.", "SVOD has gone from a first-adopter curiosity a couple of years ago to a high-stakes challenger of the traditional television business, at least in terms of perception and spending, if not yet fully on the bottom line.", "News about digitally delivered episodic content arrives from the major SVOD services at a dizzying pace (J.J. Abrams on Hulu!", "Woody Allen on Amazon Prime! A Tina Fey sitcom on Netflix!). Some of the biggest noise at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas in January was made by the old-line likes of CBS and Dish, which each touted stand-alone, over-the-top subscription services.", "A study by Nielsen last December found household SVOD penetration (defined as subscribing to one or more of the following—Netflix, Amazon Prime, or Hulu Plus) is at 40 percent of all U.S. households and climbing steadily even as traditional pay-TV penetration, currently around 84 percent, dropped less than 1 percent from 2013.", "Directors have certainly taken note, especially as high-budget scripted dramatic series have skyrocketed on SVOD platforms.", "A recent DGA study found that although the number of dramatic episodes produced for broadcast, basic cable, and pay-TV stayed fairly flat in 2014, compared with 2013, the number of such episodes produced for SVOD platforms nearly tripled, from 57 to 153.", "So, although the numbers are still small overall in comparison with more than 3,000 episodes on traditional broadcast and cable, the boom is real.", "But the numbers leave a lot of questions in their wake. Will it last? What is the impact on the creative community and the industry at large?", "If it is indeed a secular shift in content delivery, will it help directors in the long run? And furthermore, will the convenience and \"unbundled-ness\" of SVOD mean it will, as some suggest, gouge the traditional business to the point where the steady supply of episodic television directing gigs can't be supported at current levels?", "In search of elusive answers, first some quick stats: The big three SVOD providers took in about $5.1 billion in subscriber revenues in 2014 and will hit $8.8 billion by 2019, according to a report by Strategy Analytics.", "However, it should be pointed out that these figures are inflated to some degree since they include all Amazon Prime revenues, even though many Prime members sign up only for free shipping and watch no video.", "In any case, as a percentage of the total TV pie, it's still a small slice. And of course, SVOD income is limited to subscriptions only, while broadcast networks and basic cable reap tens of billions more from advertising and distribution fees—traditional TV's fabled \"dual revenue stream.\"", "Even so, the widely held narrative that is unstoppable—and not entirely inaccurate—is that consumers have embraced SVOD in a way that was not fully anticipated by traditional TV companies.", "Time Warner CEO Jeffrey Bewkes famously scoffed at the competitive threat of Netflix in 2010. \"It's a little bit like, is the Albanian army going to take over the world?\"", "he quipped. Cut to the present, when HBO's move to hasten its OTT plan is widely seen as an effort to blunt the incursion of Netflix, which has 39 million U.S. subscribers, ahead of HBO's 33 million.", "The other two major SVOD players are also gaining. Amazon has never disclosed exact Prime numbers except to say that it is in the \"tens of millions.\"", "Again, how many members actually watch video content isn't clear due to the fact that Amazon, like other SVOD platforms, isn't Nielsen-rated and discloses little about viewing patterns, preferring to mine the big data to help create targeted programming instead of promoting the aggregate numbers.", "Hulu Plus, the premium tier of the service jointly owned by 21st Century Fox, Disney, and NBCUniversal, now has more than 6 million subscribers.", "The creative community has also embraced SVOD providers simply for being dedicated to backing original content, following in a long line of cash-rich Hollywood arrivistes.", "Netflix is in the midst of a massive content push, aiming for 320 original hours in 2015 (at least 50 percent more than HBO), with big name properties including a multi-series licensing deal with Marvel Studios and a series of exclusive movies with Adam Sandler and the Duplass brothers.", "Amazon has mojo of late thanks to Transparent, Jill Soloway's DGA Award-winning series, plus its announced episodic deal with Allen.", "Hulu shuffled its management team in 2014 and has retooled with a major series from Abrams adapted from Stephen King's book 11/22/63.", "In addition to spending on original content, all three platforms have also emphasized fortifying their lineups with familiar, syndicated fare.", "A report from RBC Capital Markets projects the revenue from SVOD syndication deals to reach $6.8 billion this year, up from $5.2 billion last year, thanks to marquee pickups like Friends on Netflix, CSI on Hulu and much of HBO's back catalog on Amazon Prime.", "Although this could benefit directors in the short term, it could also have a negative impact over time.", "At this time, it's impossible to say if the residuals from licensing shows to SVOD ultimately will result in the same earnings per episode as from traditional sources like syndication, basic cable, and home video.", "In reaching its latest agreement with the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers, the DGA sought to ensure that income from high-budget dramatic series made for SVOD platforms would echo similarly budgeted cable and broadcast programs.", "For example, initial compensation rates for comparable programs are the same. In addition, the Guild developed a brand new residual formula for use on SVOD platforms, as well as formulas covering the potential future exploitation of original SVOD programs in other media.", "So if a made for SVOD program like Orange Is the New Black is \"reverse syndicated\" for basic cable reuse, residuals would be payable.", "As content news rattles around social media and viewers struggle to keep up with technology and what SVOD content can be viewed where, a reality check is in order.", "Numerous research studies do document a reluctance among millennials to spring for traditional cable, so-called cord-nevers and cord-cutters.", "Sanford C. Bernstein analyst Todd Juenger, one prominent and credible critic, has blamed SVOD adoption for ratings erosion on many ad-supported TV networks of late.", "\"SVOD is no longer incremental, it has become cannibalistic (especially in the summer, when linear TV is at its weakest),\" he wrote in a research report last fall.", "\"Viewers like SVOD because it offers programming on demand, without advertising and offers a pleasing interface and helpful recommendations,\" Juenger said.", "And yet, overall consumption of TV content remains at healthy levels—across all platforms, Americans are somehow watching an hour more of TV content per week than they did 10 years ago.", "Predictions in some quarters that subscribers to pay-TV bundles will eventually cut the cord en masse are not borne out in recent statistics.", "In its annual study of the top pay-TV providers, representing about 95 percent of the cable, satellite, and telecom market, Leichtman Research Group found they lost about 125,000 net video subscribers in 2014 (a tiny fraction of a percent), close to the 95,000 they lost in 2013.", "At the same time, it should be noted that not all SVOD content is necessarily luring viewers away from pay TV.", "There is the reality of a not-insignificant burn rate of new series on SVOD. Ratings are never released (since subscription numbers are the only things that matter) but heavily promoted series like Hemlock Grove on Netflix can disappear quickly.", "The renewal rate among original shows on cable is 48 percent and broadcast just 36 percent, but plenty of SVOD shows are one-and-done affairs.", "Amazon can, and did, suddenly kill a series (The After) created by Chris Carter of X-Files fame, never airing it, with little explanation.", "Although the dam is still holding, there is pervasive anxiety about leakage, in part because some of the content offerings of SVOD have cleared the high-quality bar of the current golden age of television.", "In today's wide open marketplace, Fridays, when most Netflix shows arrive in bulk, are now the time for appointment viewing as much as Sunday nights have been in the past for shows like The Sopranos, The Good Wife, Mad Men, and Homeland.", "The customs of the old three-network world have gone three-dimensional, with a multitude of places where compelling series can appear.", "\"The days of the 500-channel universe are over,\" CBS Chairman and CEO Leslie Moonves said at a recent investor conference.", "Instead of a bundle of hundreds of networks, the rush to appeal direct to consumer will continue. \"I think the floodgate is now open,\" he said.", "It remains to be seen, however, just how this new wave will affect directors in the long run."]}

Why did it take over a decade for TWTR to become sustainably profitable?", "Some of the answers to this question lie in TWTR’s own definition of its value proposition. Have a look at this extract from their S1 filing below:", "Extract 2: Twitter S1 filing, 2013.

I see four distinct yet correlated points which TWTR has embedded in its business model:", "Niche Platform: TWTR differentiates its platform from every other internet-based site, portal and application through its strength as a niche product.", "The key is in the experience - real time news, unfiltered opinions, quick information and intellectual interactions from all over the world based on a network you have created.", "Rich, Deep Base of Content: The collective content (forming the timeline) is enriched by the depth and quantity of its user base, unlike other portals where limited paid content is all that is shown to users.", "Powerful Search Results: TWTR has good algorithms. users can search for people, topics and trends and filter by location to find real-time content with which they want to engage.", "Open networking: Somewhat ironically, TWTR highlighted to us years ago what would later become Facebook’s competitive difference.", "Users can engage with media from other platforms (YouTube, Medium, Reddit) and embed these into their timelines to form the basis of interactions with people in their curated networks.", "How has all of the above translated into dollars and cents for TWTR’s shareholders? Have a look at an extract from TWTR’s 2012 financials below:", "Extract 3: Extract of key financial data. Source: Twitter S1 filing.", "In short, 7 years ago TWTR was a US$316m revenue business, far from profitability and grappling with spiraling costs.", "Despite being one of the most influential platforms in the world (Russia’s then-president Dmitry Medvedev visited their HQ in 2010)", "the company could not generate enough from ads to pay its bills. That $316m in revenue required $394m in costs and resulted in $79m in losses.", "Billboarding the Twitter Timeline: The Business Model", "TWTR has struggled to define its business model since inception. The past quarter, however, was its best-ever as it managed to generate just over US$900m in revenue for the 90 days from the start of September to the end of December 2018.", "However, given the company’s own Q1 2019 revenue guidance of less than US$800m, it seems the company views this performance as a lucky quarter.", "Considering the company is only 2 years younger than Facebook, and operates in the same space, why does Facebook produce almost 20x more revenue?", "Why have TWTR’s MAUs stagnated, and what does that mean for its ability to close the revenue gap with Facebook?", "Is TWTR past its prime as a business, despite its influence as a social media and political platform?", "TWTR makes its money from facilitating ads to its user base. The simple formula for success is to continuously attract more users onto the platform(s) and keep them engaged for longer so you can sell more ads.", "This is easier said than done. Twitter is my favourite social media platform, but not my favourite social media business.", "The company reported 321 million MAUs – and a back-of the envelope calculation translates this user base into revenue of around US$2.83 per user. 321 million users sounds good in that it’s almost the size of the US population.", "However, this number is still down from 330 million in Q4 2017 and down from 326 million in Q3 2018. In other words, people have left the platform year-on-year and quarter-on-quarter.", "That should mean less revenue from a smaller user base.", "However, to preserve the appearance of success TWTR has added a new metric that they want us to assess them by: the Monetizable Daily Active User (mDAU).", "“Monetizable DAU are Twitter users who log in and access Twitter on any given day through Twitter.com or our Twitter applications that are able to show ads.", "Our mDAU are not comparable to current disclosures from other companies, many of whom share a more expansive metric that includes people who are not seeing ads.", "We considered changing our disclosure to be comparable to other companies, but our goal was not to disclose just the largest daily active user number we could.”", "By this measure, TWTR gets to claim success. The company reported average mDAU of 126 million for Q4 2018, up from 115 million in Q4 2017 and up from 124 million in Q3 2017.", "Despite its best efforts to obfuscate the fact, TWTR is past its prime. Let’s assess the above below:", "1. TWTR is losing users but is getting better at showing ads to those who still engage on its platforms.", "However one might try to package it, growth in mDAU does not make up for loss in MAUs. TWTR is struggling to make its platform(s) ‘sticky’ and keep more of us on there for longer - and is now overcompensating by showing more ads to fewer people.", "2. TWTR wants to make a statement by marketing itself as ‘more transparent’ in its presentation of user numbers.", "However, Facebook reported stronger growth from a higher base – reporting 9% growth both in Daily Active Users (DAUs) and MAUs, with the numbers being 1.52 billion and 2.32 billion respectively.", "Transparency and user growth don't have to be mutually exclusive.", "TWTR now has four profitable quarters behind it, but it seems the only revenue growth channel left is to extract more dollars from fewer users.", "The company has done relatively well to add 106 million users since 2013, however that only amounts to 49% growth in more than 5 years.", "Where to next for the blue bird? I see two possible solutions, both of which have been suggested by analysts in the past:", "- Apple, Netflix and Spotify have all shown the value in building a subscription business on top of a platform.", "With a user experience as entrenched as that of TWTR, a nominal monthly fee of even US$1, or $12/yr, and would generate an additional US$3.85b for the company every year from its current MAU base.", "- Assuming that paying to access TWTR would cause 30% of users to leave the platform, the remaining 224.7million users would still add US$2.7b to the company’s top line if they chose to accept this subscription model.", "That extra cashflow would greatly assist TWTR in improving its algorithms and perhaps acquiring platforms in other spaces (podcast platforms seem to be the flavor of the month) and these could supplement TWTR’s online and offline value-add to the user base.", "For the stockholder who bought at the All Time High: A Buyout", "My personal view is that TWTR would unlock greater value as part of a greater media and entertainment group (an acquisition was once attempted by Disney).", "I see strong synergies between a hypothetical ‘Twisney’ tie-up along the following lines:", "- Disney + Twitter-Lite: Disney could unlock the user growth that TWTR so badly needs. With Disney’s appeal across various age groups and demographics, a ‘Twitter-lite’ platform for kids which would allow them to interact as they consume Disney content may draw younger users from all over the world onto the platform.", "Their real-time feedback could also feed into an algo that tells Disney what’s hot and what’s not, and this could be used to direct content production and marketing efforts.", "- ESPN + Twitter: A more focused TwESPN partnership could provide a stronger advertising channel for TWTR.", "A pay-per-view model for high-viewership sports games would allow TWTR to attract users by showing the sports they want to watch, whilst picking up valuable insights into users’ sports viewership consumption habits.", "TWTR could then package that data to gyms, sports apparel retailers, nutrition and health companies and sports teams to facilitate access to a captive audience.", "- Disney+: Integrating TWTR into DisneyPlus would give Disney the opportunity to tap into TWTR’s user base for subscription revenue whilst being able to pick up real-time feedback and comments to get an edge on Netflix.", "Now that we’ve highlighted the trouble with TWTR, the next step is to evaluate the numbers. The company is now more than 12 years old and is running out of excuses for lack of growth.", "Q4 2018 revenue was US$909m a more than 2x improvement on what it used to make in an entire year just over 6 years ago.", "With minimal revenue coming from its Data Licensing arm, there’s no question that TWTR makes its money from ads.", "The stable revenue growth and user base declines suggest to me that TWTR has limited pricing power, and advertisers can credibly threaten to move their business to Facebook, Snapchat, Amazon or Google.", "This also tells me that TWTR is not a global business in the true sense. The company’s algorithms, while good, have most of their effectiveness in the US + Canada region as well as in Japan, its second largest market.", "All of that adds up to mean that TWTR can’t create very deep/broad or highly accurate categories of buyers that advertisers can tap into to save on their marketing costs by selling us what they already know we want.", "The #fact is, unlike on Facebook, our retweets and likes don’t easily convert into dollars for the company.", "TWTR has historically struggled to get a firm grip on expenses. This is why profitability took over a decade, and more than 5 years after listing.", "However, to management’s credit, TWTR has managed to decrease costs from 120% of revenue in 2015 to 79% of revenue in 2018.", "Revenue has also grown from US$2.2b to just over US$3b over the same period, an increment of 37%. See Table 1 below:", "Table 1: TWTR Total Costs and Expenses vs Revenue: 2015 to 2018. Source: TWTR filings.", "Upon review of the distribution of costs and expenses, three interesting nuggets emerge as outlined below.", "The first is that the Cost of Sales for TWTR has increased by almost 50% over the last 4 years of its operations.", "Revenue has only increased by approximately 37% in that timeframe.", "Secondly, TWTR’s Research & Development (R&D) costs have decreased over the last few years, suggesting that there are no major product developments in scope.", "In the context of the user base declines, this does not bode well for revenue generation in an increasingly competitive market.", "Finally, within the overall cost base of US$2.4b, we see the traces of improving financial management but with no clear path to significant revenue growth to improve the cost-to-income metrics.", "Chart 1: Distribution of costs and expenses: 2015 – 2018. Numbers taken from TWTR annual reports", "Chart 2: Revenue and Income Trends, 2015 – 2018. Numbers taken from TWTR annual reports", "TWTR has grown revenue by 37%, income from operations has grown from -20% to 15% of revenue, whilst net income has grown from -23% to 8% of revenue.", "This leaves TWTR with very thin margins with which to reinvest in the business and compete in the platform-based advertising space.", "Again, this is portentous in the context of increasing competition as more and more platforms (Reddit, Facebook, Snap, Spotify, Pinterest) compete for the attention of at least one of our senses to generate advertising revenue.", "TWTR still has a lot to do to develop a track record of financial performance that will convince investors to go bullish on the stock again.", "The company also doesn't appear to have a sustainable moat or particularly good growth prospects in its highly competitive space for our attention.", "The management team has done well to improve the company from a negative position over the past couple of years, but not enough to to inspire confidence of strong returns on the stock over time.", "I love the platform and wish the company well but wouldn’t recommend the stock on what I know today.", "5yTwitter has definitely not managed to have the exponential and rapid growth in revenues in a short period of time, like Facebook.", "I definitely think they should be open to the Twitter and Disney partnership or Twitter and ESPN.

The world has changed significantly during this period.", "In 2001, the internet was still in its infancy; digitalisation was scarcely mentioned; and Kosslick wrote his first foreword for the Berlinale programme affected by the events of September 11 and the TV images of two collapsing towers.", "To have turned the Berlinale into one of the biggest public film festivals in the world, closely linked with the city and being capable of whipping it into a frenzy for eleven days once every year; to have positioned German film on the world cinema map once again and, with many new initiatives, to have made the Berlinale fit for the future – these are achievements that will endure.", "Kosslick has grounded the festival. Access, accessibility and the dismantling of barriers are merits connected to its open nature, as Ed Mesa wrote in Variety: “After succeeding former festival director Moritz de Hadeln 18 years ago, Kosslick sought to make the festival more accessible to the public.", "His folksy humor and cheerfulness lightened the event and charmed festgoers and celebrity guests alike.", "He also oversaw major changes, expansions and additions, many of which have been adopted by other leading festivals around the world” (February 4, 2019).", "At the end of May, Kosslick will hand over the direction of the Berlinale to his two successors, whose names were already revealed in June 2018: Carlo Chatrian has left his post at the Locarno Festival and, in 2020, will serve as the Berlinale’s artistic director while Mariette Rissenbeek will take over the management.", "The long-standing call for a dual leadership has thus been implemented.", "During his directorship, German film lay particularly close to Kosslick’s heart.

The Berlinale was the first big film festival to complete a comprehensive gender evaluation of its public programme as well as the composition of its management positions and committees.", "“The single biggest takeaway from Berlin 2019 – and perhaps Kosslick’s most lasting legacy as festival director – is that gender equality in the film industry is achievable.", "While Cannes and Venice equivocated and fumed – blaming society or structures beyond their control for the shocking lack of female representation in their competition lineups – Berlin, with typical German efficiency, just got things done” (Scott Roxborough, The Hollywood Reporter, February 17, 2019).", "The International Jury was also headed by a woman – Juliette Binoche. And, by signing the 5050x2020 pledge, Dieter Kosslick also formally confirmed to strive for more gender equality.", "By 2019 the Berlinale had already achieved gender parity in its management and selection committees.", "Meanwhile, the Retrospective boasted a female participation rate of 100 percent. With the title ”Self-Determined – Perspectives of Women Filmmakers”, it was dedicated to the artistic work of women in Germany on both sides of the Wall between 1969 and 1999.", "The importance of such retrospection was made clear by Susan Vahabzadeh: “It can of course be argued that, in an ideal world, there should be no difference between whether a film is directed by a woman or a man; however, in the world in which we live, men have unquestionably cultivated a male gaze throughout the 123 years of film history – and it rarely turns its attention to topics like abortion or the problems of single parents; it frequently looks at cleavages but never at the psychological effects of breast cancer” (Süddeutsche Zeitung, February 15, 2019).", "The question of women’s role in the film industry and in film was explored in detail throughout the different sections.", "The Forum, for example, focused on feminist video activism of the 1970s.

A catalyst for the conflict to be played out in public was Isabel Coixet’s Elisa y Marcela, a film that was produced by Netflix and selected for the Competition.", "The AG Kino (Guild of German Art-House Cinemas) reacted by appealing to the festival management to only show the film out of competition.", "But in keeping with the big festivals, the Berlinale took a clear position: Elisa y Marcela was screened in the Competition because Netflix had pledged to bring the film to cinemas in Spain.", "Nevertheless, the purists saw the survival of cinema as being under threat. It was about the safeguarding of existing standards versus accessibility.", "The positions were discussed quite ambivalently. Verena Lueken asked: “Should festivals, of all places, fetishise a mode of presentation which, outside of festivals, is restricted to a niche existence?”", "(Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung, February 16, 2019), something she wrote not without noting previous years and the development of the Berlinale.", "Under Kosslick’s aegis, the festival had already reacted, in 2006 at the latest, to the fact that screening practices would eventually change and had taken into account what the future might look like with the introduction of Forum Expanded.", "The section has always operated in the border areas between film and installation, cinema and museum, searching for the possibilities of different, alternative modes of reception in which special spaces beyond the cinema have always played a central role.", "In 2019, with the Betonhalle of the silent green Kulturquartier, Forum Expanded took over another one of these special locations that break open the idea of cinema as a rigidly defined architectural space and instead enquire about the nature of the images, the cinematographic, of which the big screen is only one manifestation among others.", "“Kosslick opened up the festival to the changes that film and cinema are experiencing. And he has made sure that there is an audience for what he is showing,” wrote Verena Lueken (ibid.).", "In view of the upheavals, the creation of Berlinale Series in 2015 was far-sighted. Series were exactly the format that dissolved both the aesthetic and economic boundaries between film and television and had carved a space for themselves in the gap between supposedly firmly entrenched distribution channels.", "By 2019, they were already established as the vanguard of new, innovative forms of storytelling – not least because of productions like Netflix’s House of Cards which was screened in Berlinale Special in 2014.", "The distinctions between cinema and television, big screen and small screen, art and supposed trash have long been dissolved on both the production and storytelling levels.", "And with the exploitation of new markets and target audiences, new presentation practices are constantly pushing into the field of supply and demand.", "Since 2017, the \"Berlinale Africa Hub\" has been tracing such new developments: “Half the population of sub-Saharan Africa is under 30 years old and watches audiovisual content on their smartphones and tablets,” stated EFM Director Mattijs Wouter Knol (Filmecho, February 9, 2019).", "Being fit for the future requires engaging with the altered conditions of consumption.", "Netflix et al advanced into a vacuum left by the film studios and traditional industry: “The other truth is, however, that increasingly more and even renowned directors are complaining that they cannot get their projects financed because the distributors are becoming ever more risk-averse.", "Even someone like Martin Scorsese has decided to make a passion project with Netflix” (Peter Zander, Berliner Morgenpost, February 13, 2019).", "The festival approached this issue with an open mind: Tendo Nagenda, the vice president of original films at Netflix, was invited to speak on a Berlinale Talents panel.", "But whether Netflix represents a great opportunity or a great danger for the future of filmmaking could not conclusively be settled there.", "Hopes and fears combined with each other in equal measure.", "Like Dieter Kosslick, Wieland Speck – Panorama head from 1992 to 2017 and subsequently consultant of the official programme – bid a last goodbye to the Berlinale in 2019.", "His final act was to curate, with his long-term colleague Andreas Struck, the Panorama 40 anniversary programme which brought the section’s spirit – or “soul”, as Speck put it – to the big screen.", "For Speck, the focus has always been on diversity: “I can move from entertainment to radical taboo-breakers, from experimental films to quite pleasing ones.", "We have exactly what the press, at times, call randomness; that is, diversity. To give diversity a distinct character is something which I believe we succeeded in over the years” (in conversation with Eckhard Roelcke, Deutschlandfunk Kultur, February 10, 2019).", "In retrospect, some of the core topics of the section became clear: the rupture caused by the spread of HIV in the 1980s; the cinematographic imagination and its power to change social realities; and, of course, the LGBT community that was close to the Panorama’s heart from the start.", "“The gay and lesbian community [...] has a lot to thank Wieland Speck for, not only because he retrieved queer film art from its niche but also because he recognised that cinema cannot be underestimated as a trigger of emancipation,” wrote Marcus Weingärtner in appreciation of Speck’s achievements (Der Tagesspiegel, February 7, 2019).", "Yet there are still more farewells: along with Dieter Kosslick, Thomas Hailer also left the Berlinale in 2019.", "Before he became Berlinale curator, Hailer led Generation from 2002 to 2008 and, with the introduction of the 14plus competition, developed the section into an extremely successful component of the festival.", "Maike Mia Höhne also celebrated her final year as curator of Berlinale Shorts.

journalists grudgingly acknowledging his success in transforming Berlin from a sleepy regional event to one of the world’s top five festivals with a film market second in size only to Cannes” (

Real Madrid are testament to the growing importance of revenue through commercial aspects, having established a global brand exploiting the aforementioned merchandising, sponsorship, pre-season tours and the increased desire of the global market to partner commercially with the biggest European clubs.", "Overall, the Money League continues to be dominated by clubs from the main five European leagues (Premier League in England, La Liga in Spain, Bundesliga in Germany, Ligue 1 in France and Serie A in Italy).", "Large clubs in more ‘niche’ European leagues, such as Celtic in Scotland and Ajax in the Netherlands, whilst dominating their domestic picture, pale into relative insignificance when held up against ‘the biggest’.", "The effect of this increasing dominance remains to be seen. As the biggest clubs and leagues get bigger, will opportunities (sporting, financial and commercial) for other countries, leagues and clubs decrease?", "On the other hand, perhaps the overall increased revenue throughout Europe will allow for further ‘piggybacking’ and an overall increase and development across the board.", "Real Madrid’s status as the current pre-eminent commercial exploiter is reflected in their social media presence, as they lead the market across Facebook, Instagram and Twitter.", "This conventional ‘Western’ lead is also reflected in China, with the Mailman Red Card Report concluding that the Madrid team are the top football team online in China, across Weibo and the developing Douyin and Toutiao platforms.", "The development of commercial positioning in China is focused more on the individual player – Cristiano Ronaldo’s move from Real to Juventus, for example, has led to the Italian club entering the Chinese market top 5 for the first time.", "The large Spanish exceptions aside (Real and Barcelona), the Premier League continues its relative dominance of the reports discussed, being announced as the number one league online.", "Despite the fact that the three players with the greatest Chinese media engagement (Ronaldo, Lionel Messi and Neymar) have no connection with the Premier League, it has shown a willingness to expand and embrace more innovative social media strategies in the region.", "For example, it is the first league to launch on Douyin and Toutiao – the Report emphasising the fact that “Douyin has become a major player in driving brand awareness in China”.", "The Premier League has been the first, and best, at recognising the movement away from the more traditional club website/Weibo strategy in China, and is reaping the rewards from a market ripe for commercial exploitation.", "Whilst the reports analysed here provide a useful point of reference for assessing the commercial growth and presence of football clubs, social media and turnover are only a couple of factors in assessment of the financial efficacy of clubs as businesses (club debts and profits are not considered, for example).", "As a commercial snapshot, however, they show the extraordinary growth of the sport over the last couple of decades, and the relentless rise and domination of football clubs as commercial enterprises, both locally and on a wider global scale.", "As clubs turn their eyes further east, more and more opportunities will open to them. Who will be the next global superstar, driving their team to ever greater commercial opportunity?", "Will the Premier League broadcast deal be reflected in other European leagues, leading to greater competition for the ‘league’ top spot?", "Will other sports come close to catching up with football in their drive for commercial and financial stability?", "It would be a fair observation to make that sports like rugby (union and league) would prefer first to expand into the untapped US market before looking east – something football achieved a decade ago.", "This is shown by the creation of Major League Rugby and the development of the World Sevens Series taking a particular interest in the USA and Canada, whilst Toronto Wolfpack are seeking to break into the entrenched rugby league heartlands.", "Even then, commercial expansion across the globe is not the primary focus for such sports. Similarly, football leads the sporting industry in expansion into West Africa, with a number of Premier League clubs widening their own footprint by entering into a series of country by country commercial deals.", "Will other sports achieve anything even remotely similar over the coming years and decades, when currently only the Olympics rivals football for West African brand exposure?", "MediaWrites will continue to monitor the developments with great interest – and how much the picture will have developed and changed this time next year is a source of great excitement."]}

And Iger rocked the Hollywood establishment in 2017 with his dogged pursuit of Rupert Murdoch’s 21st Century Fox entertainment empire.", "He was hunting for the kind of IP that can help drive Disney Plus and future platform offerings, and lend itself to exploitation through Disney’s well-oiled franchise machine.", "Now that the Fox acquisition is near the finish line, with a projected close by March, industry sources say pressure is mounting inside Disney’s film and TV units to grapple with the force of a number of headwinds at once.", "They’re tasked with stepping up their overall output — significantly in the case of its movie units — at a time when they’re also bracing for what will surely be a massive process of integrating the contingent of Fox executives who will make the transition.", "Layoffs of duplicative staffers are expected to reach into the hundreds, perhaps thousands. Adding still more drama, the end of the Fox merger limbo starts the beginning of a potential rivalry between Kevin Mayer, the Disney veteran overseeing the Direct-to-Consumer and International division, and Peter Rice, the long-serving Fox executive who is the incoming chairman of Walt Disney Television, to succeed Iger as CEO.", "A senior Disney TV executive described the atmosphere at the Burbank studio as “tense.”", "It’s become clear to Disney watchers that Iger — who says he plans to step down when his contract expires in 2021 — has staked part of his legacy on proving that the empire can strike back against Netflix and the upstarts that have so dramatically disrupted Hollywood’s old order.", "Insiders say the chief executive has been taking a strong hand in leading programming check-in meetings with the company’s various divisions.", "Questions about how it will manage the transition from traditional distribution models into the walled garden of direct-to-consumer services are so numerous that Disney has scheduled an Investor Day presentation on the topic for April 11.", "The company is also hoping to dazzle with a demo of the service and a sneak peek at some of the programming in the works.", "Wall Street sources say Disney will have to shed light on three key points in pitching the streaming strategy to investors: how much it will spend on content, how much traditional licensing revenue will be lost by keeping more of its content in-house, and when it expects the bottom of that investment cycle to come before a return to growth.", "“It’s going to be years until they start to recover their investment in streaming,” says Hal Vogel, veteran industry analyst.", "“They will be forgoing high profit margin revenues and moving into a very competitive arena with Netflix and Amazon and probably Apple.", "Investors are focused right now on the dream of seeing everybody move into streaming. But we need to know more about what the pain points are for these companies and how much they are willing to lose.”", "More details about Disney’s investment to date in its Direct-to-Consumer operations will be forthcoming on Feb. 5, when the conglom reports its fiscal first quarter earnings.", "For the first time, the company will break out financials for the Direct-to-Consumer and International division.", "Disney earlier this month disclosed that the unit recorded a loss for the first nine months of 2018 of $738 million in operating income on revenue of $3.4 billion, most of which came from Disney’s international channels.", "Disney is up to the huge challenges ahead, in the view of RBC Capital Markets senior media analyst Steven Cahall.", "He estimates the company will devote about $500 million to original programming for Disney Plus in 2019.", "“Disney spends more on content than anyone else globally. It has decades of experience in making excellent content, it has a huge balance sheet with low leverage and it’s a brand that’s known the world over,” Cahall wrote in December.", "RBC research pegs Disney as the biggest spender among media giants on content, with a projected $23.8 billion for 2019, or $16.4 billion excluding sports-related properties.", "Disney’s total spending to fill its pipeline amounts to 22% of the estimated $107 billion in global content spending among the largest media companies.", "AT&T and Netflix are next on the list with $14.3 billion and $14 billion, respectively, per RBC.", "With so much on the line, insiders are increasingly scrutinizing the programming plans for Disney Plus as well as the team assembled to execute the service.", "There’s little doubt that the streaming venture will rise or fall largely on the popularity of its original content.", "In that context, questions have been raised in the creative community about the absence (so far) of deeply experienced programming executives at the top of Disney Plus.", "Disney’s approach has come into sharp focus as its largest traditional competitors — NBCUniversal and WarnerMedia — in recent weeks have tapped veterans Bonnie Hammer and Kevin Reilly, respectively, to lead programming for streaming efforts that aren’t nearly as ambitious at the outset as those of Disney Plus.", "Ricky Strauss, who spent the past six years as head of film marketing for Disney, was named president of content and marketing for Disney Plus in June.", "Agnes Chu was tapped to oversee content shortly after Disney disclosed its intent to launch the service in August 2017.", "She’s a senior VP who was a story and franchise development executive at Walt Disney Imagineering. She worked as VP in the office of the chairman-CEO and was a close aide to Iger from 2013-16.", "Before that, she spent three years as director of daytime and current programming at ABC, where she supervised “General Hospital” and primetime comedies “Malibu Country” and “Don’t Trust the B—- in Apt. 23.”", "Leading the charge at the top is Mayer, with the Direct-to-Consumer and International division created last March to house Disney Plus and its eight-month-old counterpart ESPN Plus.", "Mayer had been head of corporate strategy and business development since 2005. He’s been Iger’s right hand on the studio acquisition spree — Pixar, Marvel, Lucasfilm and most recently 21st Century Fox — that turbo-charged Disney into the world’s largest media company.", "Strauss and Chu are each accomplished executives who are known to be well respected by their peers inside and outside Disney.", "They obviously have Iger’s vote of confidence. But there’s no disputing that neither has extensive experience in managing high-end TV series productions.", "Strauss served as head of production for Participant Media before Disney. Chu worked in documentary production before joining Disney in 2008 to develop digital content.", "Iger has been weighing in on plans for big-ticket projects such as “The Mandalorian,” the first-ever live-action “Star Wars” series, which is sure to be a big selling point for Disney Plus.", "While Disney has bluntly stated that its streaming service will not try to match Netflix in terms of sheer volume of originals, sources say Iger has of late pushed the team to stoke the development pipeline to ensure a steady stream of fresh content can land on Disney Plus in the months after its launch.", "At the same time, sources say Iger sees much of the creative spark for Disney Plus as coming from the creative teams behind the studio’s four content brands that will populate the service: Disney, Marvel, Lucasfilm and Pixar, as well as Fox’s main operating units, including FX, Fox Searchlight and National Geographic and its prestigious documentary vault.", "A source close to the situation says there was a belief that executives from backgrounds other than traditional primetime TV might be better suited to building a new-paradigm programming operation.", "Chu’s team has been augmented in recent months with the hiring of Sarah Shepard, formerly of Smokehouse Pictures, as VP of scripted content and Marvel alum Dan Silver as VP of unscripted.", "“We have the luxury of programming this product with programs from those brands or derived from those brands, which obviously creates a demand and gives us the ability to not necessarily be in the volume game, but to be in the quality game,” Iger told Wall Street analysts in August.", "Insiders say the thinking is that as a strictly VOD platform, the programming management needs of Disney Plus are different from that of a traditional network with a development and greenlighting hierarchy.", "And it has been emphasized that feeding strong content to Disney Plus is meant to be a holistic effort among all of the company’s content-producing units.", "Marvel, Lucasfilm and Pixar have long operated with a great deal of autonomy in plotting their film and TV projects, albeit with support from the Walt Disney Studios operation headed by Alan Horn and from network partners.", "On the series side, as development began to ramp up last year, there was confusion about how Disney Plus would handle dealmaking and the always-contentious issue of profit participation points for talent.", "Disney ultimately settled on a formula for “buying out” points up front — much as Netflix, Amazon and HBO do — because there will be no aftermarket sales of the titles to split among participants.", "Sources describe the Disney Plus formulas and pay scales as generous for Marvel- and “Star Wars”-branded productions — “They’re spending real money on those shows,” says one top TV agent — but that other productions are offering less lucrative deals than comparable projects would likely command at Netflix or Amazon.", "Others say the structure at Disney Plus has made it a little unwieldy to make deals for shows and also more difficult to pitch concepts and talent to the service.", "“Do you pitch Agnes? Do you pitch Jeph [Loeb, Marvel’s TV chief]? It’s not clear yet which door gets you in,” says another veteran agent.", "Original movies are slated to be a big part of the Disney Plus lineup. At first, industry sources say the message from the Disney Plus team last year was that it was looking for modestly budgeted movie concepts.", "Then came word that it is open to projects with a wider budget range of $20 million to $60 million. Sean Bailey, president of motion picture production for Disney Studios, is playing a major role in liaising with the imprints and helping to steer the movies strategy.", "Other projects are coming from the seasoned team at Disney Channels Worldwide, which has long produced telepics.", "Strategy adjustments and dealmaking hiccups are hardly unexpected for such an expansive start-up effort.", "Sources close to the situation point to the hiring earlier this month of Fox alum Joe Earley as exec VP of marketing and operations for Disney Plus as recognition that more heft was needed to prepare for the launch.", "Earley had a 21-year run at Fox Broadcasting, rising to chief operating officer for Fox Television Group.", "He spent the past three years as president of Gail Berman’s Jackal Group shepherding TV, film and legit productions.", "Earley will soon be joined under the larger Disney corporate umbrella by a host of former TV and film colleagues from 20th Century Fox.", "Walt Disney Television chairman Rice and Disney Television Studios and ABC Entertainment chairman Dana Walden, the Fox executives who will take on the top TV leadership roles at Disney (excluding ESPN), will be involved in feeding content to Disney Plus through their oversight of the combined ABC Studios and 20th Century Fox Television operations.", "Disney’s master plan for how Disney’s and Fox’s existing production units in film and TV will be integrated — or whether they will remain separate imprints — is still being sorted out.", "“There are a lot of [Disney and Fox executives] out there still waiting to see where they’re going to go,” notes a TV industry vet.", "Corporate integrations on the scale of Disney and 21st Century Fox are famously fraught with unexpected obstacles (think AOL-Time Warner).", "Political battles and turf wars are commonplace in any such melding of operations, particularly those with such distinctly different corporate cultures as Disney and Fox.", "The perception that Mayer and Rice are in a foot race to the CEO suite — rightly or wrongly, that’s the conventional wisdom in Hollywood — could add a wrinkle to the mandate for DTC/International and Walt Disney Television to work together in the enlarged Disney sandbox.", "Executives in Burbank and Century City are bracing for a post-merger roller-coaster ride. The industry is waiting to see how Disney marshals its brand firepower for the streaming age.", "Disney’s board of directors no doubt has its eye on how the Disney Plus launch process plays out across the company as it evaluates successor options for Iger.", "“It’s going to be Mr. Toad’s Wild Ride around here for a while,” says a longtime Disney insider."]}

First, it is not as if Netflix is counting on box office receipts: to point out that the company isn’t earning $700 million or $1.4 billion or whatever is even more of a moot point than the number of people that watched Bird Box.", "Secondly, and relatedly, Netflix is counting on subscription revenue. To that end, producing a piece of content that 58% of its subscriber base viewed in a single month is by definition a triumph (and yes, worth ~$700 million).", "Third, and most importantly, the success of Bird Box drives the virtuous cycle that Netflix has as an aggregator in multiple ways.", "Start with the most important side for an Aggregator — the demand side. Bird Box and other successful content does triple duty for Netflix:", "- For current customers, Bird Box provides two hours of entertainment and a pass into popular culture.", "- For prospective customers, Bird Box makes Netflix more attractive for the same price. Or, to look at it another way, it lowers Netflix’s customer acquisition cost.", "- For marginal customers, Bird Box is a reason to stay on the platform. It lowers Netflix’s customer retention cost.", "The latter two points are critical pieces of what makes an Aggregator an Aggregator; from Defining Aggregators:", "Once an aggregator has gained some number of end users, suppliers will come onto the aggregator’s platform on the aggregator’s terms, effectively commoditizing and modularizing themselves.", "Those additional suppliers then make the aggregator more attractive to more users, which in turn draws more suppliers, in a virtuous cycle.", "This means that for aggregators, customer acquisition costs decrease over time; marginal customers are attracted to the platform by virtue of the increasing number of suppliers.", "This further means that aggregators enjoy winner-take-all effects: since the value of an aggregator to end users is continually increasing it is exceedingly difficult for competitors to take away users or win new ones.", "This is in contrast to non-aggregator and non-platform companies that face increasing customer acquisition costs as their user base grows.", "That is because initial customers are often a perfect product-market fit; however, as that fit decreases, the surplus value from the product decreases as well and quickly turns negative.", "Generally speaking, any business that creates its customer value in-house is not an aggregator because eventually its customer acquisition costs will limit its growth potential.", "The question, then, is why do suppliers come onto Netflix’s platform?", "The first reason is that Netflix pays the most. From a supplier perspective that is certainly straightforward, but the question as to why Netflix can pay the most is an interesting one.", "- First, Netflix is selling content to the entire world. That means its customer base is larger than other content buyers, giving Netflix greater buying power", "- Second, because of the demand-side dynamics I just described, Netflix is not simply selling to today’s subscribers, but the subscribers it anticipates attracting over the next several years, giving Netflix greater buying power again.", "- Third, because Netflix is not monetizing any particular piece of content in isolation, but rather as part of an overall subscription offering, it can more easily absorb failures on one hand (its customers have other shows to watch), and capture excess value on the other (because the lifetime value of customers is far greater than a single movie ticket).", "This means that Netflix’s risk, relative to traditional distributors, is significantly biased towards the upside, justifying higher prices.", "Secondly, Netflix has long appealed to the other motivations a supplier might have, particularly creative control.", "What the success of Bird Box shows, though, is that Netflix is uniquely capable of driving an audience as well.", "Sure, the company spent money on marketing Bird Box, but the reality is that Bird Box was popular because it was on Netflix.", "That is what drove views, and what drove Bird Box into the popular consciousness, and while all suppliers like getting paid, artists in particular like to be seen.", "And so we have a virtuous cycle: Netflix’s control of demand draws suppliers, which increases demand, and so it goes.", "Between the Bird Box announcement and Netflix’s earnings (where the company announced similar stellar viewership numbers for a number of other shows) came one more piece of news: Netflix is raising the price on U.S. subscribers by $2/month; new subscribers will pay the new price immediately, while existing subscribers will be phased in over the next several months.", "CEO Reed Hastings said on the company’s earnings interview:3", "With respect to the price changes…you’ll see that impact over the course of the year, and what that means is that will obviously impact the rate of net addition growth in the first half of the year.", "But commensurately, you also see ASP domestically improve over the course of the year and that’s what we think will drive an acceleration in revenue growth over the course of 2019.", "And that’s what also we believe drive operating margin higher sequentially over the course of the year to enable us to hit that 13% target for the full year.", "One of the obvious challenges for Netflix, particularly in the United States, is saturation. The company has 60 million subscribers in the U.S., which as of 2017 had 126 million households; given widespread account sharing, the company’s penetration is almost certainly well over 50%.", "There is still room for growth — around 100 million households have traditional multichannel video programming (i.e. the cable bundle) — but by definition households without Netflix are either exceptionally hard to reach (which is why Netflix has partnered with MVPDs to sell the service) or exceptionally frugal.", "Raising the price will certainly further inhibit the latter with their presumably high price elasticity.", "At the same time, Netflix is clearly confident that the price elasticity of its existing customers is very low: the company does not appear to expect any undue churn, which is reasonable given that previous price increases went off without a hitch.", "More broadly, it speaks to the importance of understanding how it is that Bird Box and other Netflix original content affects demand:", "This is a graphical representation of the point I made above: existing customers are less price elastic, and marginal customers are more likely to stick around or sign up.", "Critically, this is a win for every part of the value chain: subscribers get more value, Netflix gets more revenue, and there is more money for suppliers.", "Much of this is obvious, at least at this point, but it is particularly noteworthy in the context of Netflix’s competitors.", "The traditional MVPD value chain, for example, has four participants: suppliers, networks, distributors (cable, satellite, or virtual), and end users.", "This made sense when the chief constraints were time and the need to actually run a cable into the back of an end user’s television, but it is a significant handicap in a world where there is no time constraint and where distribution is over the Internet.", "Consider the recent announcement from NBC; from CNBC:", "Comcast’s NBCUniversal plans to debut a free, ad-supported streaming service to anyone that subscribes to a traditional pay-TV service, including competitors such as Charter, AT&T, Cox and Dish, in the first quarter of 2020, the company announced Monday.", "For those that don’t subscribe to a pay-TV service, the streaming product, which will include 1,500 hours of NBC TV shows, such as SNL and Parks and Recreation, and hundreds of hours of Universal movies, will cost somewhere around $12 a month, a person familiar with the company’s plans told CNBC.", "The service will be run by Bonnie Hammer, the company announced Monday.", "This sounds suspiciously like TV Everywhere, the plan to allow MVPD subscribers to log into dedicated apps with their cable account.", "The problem is that the MVPD value chain ensured that TV Everywhere would be a complete mess:", "- Instead of there being one app, consumers had to download an app per network", "- Not all networks supported TV Everywhere, or did so inconsistently", "- Not all cable networks supported TV Everywhere, or did so inconsistently", "In short, TV Everywhere was an attempt to apply a value chain that was created around cable television to a fundamentally new paradigm, which introduced massive amounts of misalignment and inefficiency, most of which was borne by the end user.", "And oh, by the way, the old business model of advertising as well.", "Contrast that to Netflix which has created a value chain perfectly attuned to the streaming paradigm.", "Netflix’s integration of production and distribution also dramatically increases its flexibility and addressable markets when it comes to both supply and demand.", "On the demand side, as noted above, Netflix can reach users both all over the world as well as into the future.", "Just as importantly, on the supply side Netflix can accommodate all kinds of content on all kinds of deal terms.", "Our main goal is to make the best content. And we’ve said in previous quarters that that is a combination of several different business models depending on who owns the IP.", "So, what we’re going to do is make the best show and not be stuck on the business model, because the consumer really doesn’t understand that or we even want to spend any time thinking about it.", "So by way of example, last year, we had 140 different shows around the world that premiered on a network somewhere and on Netflix everywhere else in the world.", "Next year, it’s more to closer to 180. And these are combination of co-producing with local producers in other countries; it shows that then air on a network in that country and then premier on Netflix.", "But when I say co-production, I mean, we come in at the script stage, we come in at the first money stage, we’re involved creatively with the production of that show.", "Netflix has shows it owns completely, shows it own first-run rights to, hybrid shows like Hastings described, second-run shows — it runs the gamut.", "Critically, while some models are more profitable than others, all make the service more attractive to Netflix’s customers.", "This will be a particular challenge for a company like Disney: the company is staking a good portion of its future on its own streaming service driven by its own IP, but has not suggested a willingness to scale supply like Netflix has.", "That, by definition, will limit the company’s upside when it comes to consumer reach and also long-term pricing power.", "These two points are related: tighter integration in the middle of the value chain means more flexibility and modularity on the edges.", "Netflix knows this, which is why the company didn’t even bother labeling Comcast or Disney its competitors.", "From the company’s letter to investors (emphasis mine):", "In the US, we earn around 10% of television screen time and less than that of mobile screen time. In other countries, we earn a lower percentage of screen time due to lower penetration of our service.", "We earn consumer screen time, both mobile and television, away from a very broad set of competitors. We compete with (and lose to)", "Our growth is based on how good our experience is, compared to all the other screen time experiences from which consumers choose.", "Our focus is not on Disney+, Amazon or others, but on how we can improve our experience for our members.", "This is perhaps the biggest flex of all: Netflix is so confident in its position it is effectively stating that if customers choose to watch TV, they will choose Netflix.", "I wrote a follow-up to this article in this Daily Update.", "Bird Box premiered at the AFI Fest on November 12, 2018, and had a very limited theatrical release on December 14 ↩", "As an aside, Netflix’s “Earnings Interview”, in which one analyst is allowed to ask questions (as opposed to Q&A from a number of analysts), seems like an unnecessary attempt to control the narrative from a company that, as this optimistic analysis suggests, doesn’t seem to have anything to hide ↩"]}

In January 2012, a group of investors sued the company for loss of profits.", "Clearly, a bit of the company’s luster as a Silicon Valley darling has been lost, and Reed Hastings’s reputation as a strategically adept CEO has been damaged.", "The unfolding lawsuit will undoubtedly raise more questions about Hastings’s judgment and culpability.", "The company stumbled, and in the end the consequences may be serious. But when you take a deeper look — beyond the hype and recriminations — the implications for business strategy, particularly in the Internet era, are more nuanced.", "Reed Hastings and his team got some important things wrong in changing the Netflix strategy, but they also got a great deal right.", "The business split. They got this right. The natural boundaries between the physical (mail) and virtual (streaming) markets for pre-recorded movies are increasingly sharp, especially as the streaming market takes off.", "These two delivery models require distinct assets and capabilities to be successful, and each faces a very different group of competitors.", "Physical competitors include Blockbuster and Redbox, whereas virtual rivals include Amazon, Hulu, iTunes, LoveFilm, and cable TV companies.", "Netflix’s decision to split the businesses was the right one because it created focus and increased the company’s chances of being successful with distinctive business strategies tailored to different natural markets.", "To thrive, Netflix will have to find a way to execute well with these two bifurcated operating models under one corporate umbrella.", "As Hastings recently said, Netflix can expect to lose mail-only subscribers every quarter from now on.", "Thus, he and his team will be managing one business (DVDs by mail) for decline while growing its replacement (streaming) in the face of fierce competition from a new set of formidable rivals.", "This is one of the toughest challenges a company can have.", "Pricing. They got this right, too. Services that deliver discs by mail have different demand curves from those that stream video content, and they also have very different costs to serve their customers.", "That’s why different pricing schemes make sense. Netflix’s much-decried 60 percent price increase was assessed only on those who signed up for both mail and streaming.", "Most observers didn’t recognize this point. The net effective price increase, when applied to Netflix’s entire subscriber base, was closer to 20 percent.", "Before July 2011, Netflix had bundled streaming with its core delivery-by-mail service because it was a nascent market and the selection of available videos was limited.", "The market had not been ready for a stand-alone streaming-only business. During that period, Netflix subsidized the development of its streaming business by essentially giving it away to its DVD-by-mail subscribers.", "Later, though, with competition from the likes of Apple and Amazon, that would have to change.", "Of course, nobody likes a price increase, and even after the company finally adjusted its pricing model, there was still a lot of noise from the customer base.", "But, as the dust settles, it has turned out that Netflix lost less than 5 percent of its customers (800,000 out of a subscriber base of nearly 24 million).", "Adjusting its pricing was the right decision, and the company has notably stuck by that decision.", "Brand management. The company really didn’t think this through. Netflix chose to make explicit the distinction between its two business models by giving them separate brands — Qwikster for the original by-mail business and Netflix for the new streaming business — and requiring separate unlinked accounts.", "Netflix had built its brand on being an innovative, consumer-centric company that revolutionized the way movies were rented.", "It allowed people to move from the inconvenient bricks-and-mortar chain store model to one with online, assisted selection; home delivery of DVDs in an iconic red envelope; and, most importantly, no returns, no late fees, and no “library fine”–style guilt.", "The brand was built on those attributes, and it engendered significant loyalty among its subscriber base.", "The decision to change the original business brand name to Qwikster in one fell swoop was apparently based on the premise that the Netflix brand would be more valuable in the newer streaming space.", "But it was a misstep. The equally swift reversal of the decision might have controlled some of the damage, but there has probably been some permanent dilution of brand equity.", "In retrospect, it would have been wiser to find a way to brand both services as Netflix, or if a new brand was necessary, to apply it to the new service.", "Communications. Where do we start? After charting an unerring path for so long with consumers, it was surprising to see Netflix make so many fundamental mistakes on the communications front.", "Some will say that Netflix got its strategy wrong. Others will say the strategy was right but poorly implemented.", "Ultimately, the distinction doesn’t matter; missteps of this magnitude become strategic issues.", "In the meantime, the Netflix debacle offers some important lessons for strategists. First, timing is sometimes the hardest part of strategy to get right.", "Netflix likely judged correctly that its mail business was going to be cannibalized and ultimately replaced by streaming.", "But no one can really know for sure how fast that might happen. Moving too early can be disastrous, as Netflix learned, but moving too late can be even worse — as companies such as Kodak, Research in Motion, and Nokia have discovered.", "Another aspect of timing, the speed of change, is also difficult to master. Netflix sprang its new service on its customers too abruptly.", "Second, strategy should be based on how customers behave, not on what they say. Before Netflix announced its change, customers had posted many online messages about the value of switching to streaming.", "But talk is cheap. Netflix learned this when it began to implement the change, asking customers to switch to a new account if they wanted their videos by streaming instead of mail — and then customers balked.", "Third, when customers have an intense loyalty to a particular product (or service or brand), they become nearly as vested in the product as the company is.", "Coca-Cola Company learned this lesson the hard way in 1985, when it replaced its original flagship cola with a new cola.", "Many of Coke’s most loyal consumers were outraged by its unilateral decision to take away “their” product.", "Likewise, Netflix’s customers were outraged when the company took the Netflix name away from “their” original mail service.", "Finally, strategy has to be dynamic and iterative. Customer reaction to any change in a company’s value proposition is difficult to know a priori, even with the best market research.", "Having the agility to change your choices when new information comes to light is essential to strategy success.", "This type of agility, no matter what mistakes Netflix made, may save the company in the end. In fact, Netflix announced in January that in its latest quarter it had already replaced three-fourths of the subscribers who left last fall.", "Likewise, the stock has recovered much of the loss it sustained during the backlash.", "- Ken Favaro is a senior partner with Booz & Company based in New York.

Blockbuster went bankrupt in 2010 and Netflix is now a $28 billion dollar company, about ten times what Blockbuster was worth.", "Today, Hastings is widely hailed as a genius and Antioco is considered a fool. Yet that is far too facile an explanation.", "Antioco was, in fact, a very competent executive—many considered him a retail genius—with a long history of success.", "Yet for all his operational acumen, he failed to see that networks of unseen connections would bring about his downfall.", "Over the past 15 years, scientists have learned much about how these networks function and how his fate could have been avoided.", "When Hastings flew to Dallas and proposed his deal in 2000, Blockbuster sat atop the video rental industry.", "With thousands of retail locations, millions of customers, massive marketing budgets and efficient operations, it dominated the competition.", "So it’s not surprising that Antioco and his team balked at simply handing over the brand they had worked hard to build.", "Yet Blockbuster’s model had a weakness that wasn’t clear at the time. It earned an enormous amount of money by charging its customers late fees, which had become an important part of Blockbuster’s revenue model.", "The ugly truth—and the company’s achilles heel—was that the company’s profits were highly dependent on penalizing its patrons.", "At the same time, Netflix had certain advantages. By eschewing retail locations, it lowered costs and could afford to offer its customers far greater variety.", "Instead of charging to rent videos, it offered subscriptions, which made annoying late fees unnecessary.", "Customers could watch a video for as long as they wanted or return it and get a new one.", "Netflix proved to be a very disruptive innovation, because Blockbuster would have to alter its business model—and damage its profitability—in order to compete with the startup.", "Despite being a small, niche service at the time, it had the potential to upend Blockbuster’s well oiled machine.", "While Netflix’s model clearly had some compelling aspects, it also had some obvious disadvantages. Without retail locations, it was hard for people to find it.", "Moreover, because its customers received their videos by mail, the service was somewhat slow and cumbersome.", "People couldn’t just pick up a movie for the night on their way home.", "Still, customers loved the service and told their friends. Some were reluctant at first, they actually liked being able to browse movies at the store and pick one up at a moments notice, but others jumped right in.", "And as more of their friends raved about Netflix, the laggards tried it too, fell in love with it and convinced people they knew to give it a shot.", "Network scientists call this the threshold model of collective behavior. For any given idea, there are going to be people with varying levels of resistance.", "As those who are more willing begin to adopt the new concept, the more resistant ones become more likely to join in.", "Under the right conditions, a viral cascade can ensue.", "The best way to understand thresholds is to look at the diffusion of ideas model formulated by Everett Rogers in the 1960’s.", "While ideas usually take hold in small niches of innovators, they can often spread to early adopters, who are only slightly more resistant to join in.", "Once they’re on board, those in the early majority begin to feel comfortable giving it a try. As each threshold is past, the next group becomes more likely to adopt the new idea.", "Unfortunately, this effect is devilishly hard to quantify. Duncan Watts, a pioneer in network theory, is quick to point out that social dynamics tend to be idiosyncratic and it’s not always clear exactly where thresholds exist.", "Still, you can use conventional marketing analysis to evaluate whether an idea is spreading to new groups or just growing within a niche.", "It is not clear whether Antioco’s team did such an analysis or not, but by 2004—six years before the company went bankrupt—he sensed that Netflix had become a significant threat and sought to change his firm’s policies.", "Yet how he went about doing that sealed his, and ultimately Blockbuster’s, fate.", "Once John Antioco became convinced that Netflix, and to a lesser extent Redbox, was a threat, he used his authority as CEO—as well as the credibility he had earned by nearly doubling Blockbuster’s revenues during his tenure—to discontinue the late fees that annoyed customers and invest heavily into a digital platform to ensure the brand’s future.", "Antioco’s article in Harvard Business Review describes what happened next. While he convinced the board to back his plan, one of his lieutenants, Jim Keyes, led a rear guard action.", "He pointed out that the costs of Antioco’s changes — about $200 million to drop late fees and another $200 million to launch Blockbuster Online—were damaging profitability.", "Eventually, an activist investor, Carl Icahn, began to question Antioco’s leadership. Antioco lost the board’s confidence and was fired over a compensation dispute in 2005.", "Keyes was named CEO and immediately reversed Antioco’s changes in order to increase profitability. Blockbuster went bankrupt five years later.", "Keyes felt the company couldn’t afford to keep losing so much money, so we pulled the plug. To this day I don’t know what would have happened if we’d avoided the big blowup over Antioco’s bonus and he’d continued growing Total Access.", "So the inability to understand the networks that would determine his fate struck John Antioco twice. First, he failed to realize how quickly a niche idea could snowball into a viral cascade.", "Second, he failed to construct a network that could carry his ideas of change throughout his own organization.", "For all the excitement surrounding online social platforms such as Facebook and Twitter, we really haven’t scratched the surface on the networks we encounter in real life: The networks of consumers that make up our brands and industries as well as the organizational networks that determine how things get done—or don’t get done—in our enterprises.", "And it’s imperative that we start thinking about them more seriously. We need to stop acting as if there is a recipe for business—like a cake or a casserole—and start thinking in terms of how factors are connected.", "The structure of those unseen connections, their context and how they relate to our objectives increasingly makes the difference between success and failure.", "Unfortunately, there are no definitive answers. As Duncan Watts told me, “You have to test and learn as you’re going along, but if you understand how networks work and are willing to invest resources into researching the ones that affect your business, you can significantly improve decision making.”", "Watts points to recent research done at Facebook as an example how a well designed study can reveal much about how influence spreads through networks.", "He also notes that that digital trails left by emails and electronic calendars can be very useful for mapping organizational networks.", "Fortunately, we have far more tools today than Antioco did then.", "The irony is that Blockbuster failed because its leadership had built a well-oiled operational machine.", "It was a very tight network that could execute with extreme efficiency, but poorly suited to let in new information.", "Antioco’s fatal flaw wasn’t one of intelligence or capability, but a failure to understand the networks that would determine his fate."]}

Definitely, academia was a good way to go. Actually, I found myself pretty attracted to university life, in general.", "It was a good way to prolong that, but that’s not the way it played out.", "Brian: So the first few jobs when you came out of university, were they generally in, like, research labs and things like that?", "Neil: Yeah. I managed to overlap those in a fairly unusual way. I got my BSc at the University of Durham, and then I stayed on there to do a PhD.", "And once I finished the coursework, my professor ended up signing me to a summer internship at a lab in Palo Alto called Schlumberger Palo Alto Research.", "And it was very much doing work that was aligned with the computer vision and image processing research that I was doing at…well, had by then become the University of Aberdeen because my professor had moved.", "And so, I got to spend a summer, which turned into five years at Schlumberger, and I did eventually graduate.", "It took a little longer than it should’ve done, but I came out with my PhD eventually in, whenever that was, 1999.", "Neil: I came out eventually. Would’ve graduated in 1989 when Schlumberger dissolved their lab.", "Brian: But when you were at Schlumberger, that’s generally in the what, the mid-’80s, early ’80s?", "Neil: Yeah, 1984 for a bunch of years. That’s right, yeah.", "Neil: Schlumberger, of course, was an oil field services company, so then, in the ’80s, they were getting very deeply into computer and microelectronic stuff", "and so they bought a bunch of companies. And remember, they bought Fairchild. This was actually the Fairchild AI Lab, and, you know, it became a Schlumberger Palo Alto lab about the day before I joined, in fact.", "Brian: And I bring that up because, is it correct that you met Reed Hastings at Schlumberger?", "Neil: That’s correct, yeah. He was there in a different position, but we crossed paths from time to time.", "And that formed a connection that he would come to tap a little later on.", "Brian: Right. So moving forward a bit in time, can you tell me about Pure Software, what it was, and how you got involved in what you did there?", "Neil: Yeah. After the Schlumberger Lab had dissolved, people were spun out to all kinds of different companies, and I went to join [inaudible] Research Lab.", "And I was working on productizing some of my research, making a software tool, and Reed contacted me.", "He had built a prototype of a software checking and validation tool he thought might be useful. And he brought it over and I tried it out, and it was useful.", "It found a bunch of issues and challenges. And shortly afterwards, he invited me to join his new company and productize that offering.", "And then that was Pure Software and the tool was Purify, which was a C and C++ error checking tool.", "Brian: So to be clear, Reed founded Pure and was the CEO?", "Neil: Yes, it’s 1991. And Pure Software quickly became profitable on that [inaudible] tool Purify, and then we added a variety of additional tools.", "The software tool space was going through a phase of consolidation at that point, and so there were a bunch of different mergers.", "Oh, by the way, we became Pure Atria Software, and then we became Rational Software and a big suite of software development tools off of Rational, of which Purify was one, and that was kind of the story there.", "At that point, Reed moved on. I moved, temporarily, to Boston, which probably wasn’t my long-term future.", "And in that intervening year, Reed and a couple of other folk, Mark Randolph and a few folk, started putting Netflix together.", "And in 1998, he approached me about joining Netflix and moving the engineering effort there. And so we came and talked, and ended up…I joined Netflix in early 1999 when it was still a very nascent business and there were lots of things still to be figured out in the future.", "Brian: To the best of your recollection, I know it’s a long time ago, but do you remember what you thought of the idea of Netflix when you first heard about it?", "Neil: It clearly had some big ambitions, but at the time, the goal was to start building a business around shipping DVDs through the mail.", "And DVDs, you remember, were only just introduced, so there was a very small install base of DVD players in the country and the world.", "And shipping by email was an unusual proposition, to be sure, so it was quite a speculative venture.", "Brian: So when you do sign on, what is your job description, or what do you work on first? What do you join the company to do?", "Neil: My job description was VP of Internet Engineering. And the first mission, perhaps, was to solve the year 2000 problem, which was upon us at that time.", "And even though this was a brand new company, we were able to find a bunch of places where two digit year codes would’ve rolled over backwards and caused all kinds of trouble.", "In the end, 11 months later, we didn’t have a year 2000 problem, but it was certainly the very first thing dumped on my plate on day one.", "Brian: So the website, when you got there, had already been launched live to the public?", "Neil: Yes, it had. That’s right. At that point, it was a service offering transactions a la carte, rentals of DVDs for a period of a week or so.", "And we found it pretty difficult to get consumers to come back and have a second try. You know, shipping delay is a pretty serious impediment when you’re taking a day to four days to ship a disc each way.", "And so at that stage, the business was not tremendously successful.", "Brian: Well, right. I think we need to underline that. Everyone thinks of Netflix as this subscription service, but it was an a la carte rental service at the beginning.", "Do you remember what the thinking was that evolved into the subscription plan that people would remember?", "I’d like to lay just a little claim to credit for calling it the “Queue” which, of course, me as a Brit, that’s a very familiar word.", "Neil: Well, even before I joined, we were discussing how we could turn this into a recurring revenue model, which is what subscription is, effectively.", "And it became quickly apparent that we needed to get to that really quickly. We were able to get customers to come try Netflix, but to get them to come back again was difficult.", "And so, the key pieces that we needed to build were a model where people pay for a month of service and then they get to use it a number of times during that month.", "And secondly, the Queue was a super important piece of the puzzle because if you got consumers to build a list of the titles they were interested in, then you could automatically ship the next one when they returned the first one.", "And that was the key to providing a continuity of service and a value that made people engage.", "And so, I’d like to lay just a little claim to credit for calling it the “Queue” which, of course, me as a Brit, that’s a very familiar word.", "To people outside of Britain who are not computer scientists, queue is a pretty strange word, is it the Kway or the QU or what have you?", "Unfortunately, my technical terminology leaked through into the consumer space, which I’ve regretted for years and years, but it is kind of a humor", "Brian: Yeah. I mean, so the queue is obviously this… moving to subscription allows you to do the Queue, it allows you to collect information what people want to watch next and what they’re interested in, but it also gives you the great tagline of “No late fees.”", "Neil: That’s right, exactly, yes. I think I’ve got it the other way around. The Queue allowed us to go to subscription, not the other way around.", "Without a queue, we wouldn’t have had a subscription plan, but with a queue, we are able to eliminate late fees, to always have a DVD sitting on top of your TV ready to go, and you know, the rest was history at that point.", "The business began to grow and accumulate subscribers, and the revenue started [inaudible] looking great.", "We worked on the…I joined in ’99, we started work on subscription pretty quickly. And by the fall of ’99, we were out with the subscription plan.", "Brian: And you also—correct me if I’m wrong—but you also started working really early on things like personalization and algorithms to help recommend movies and things like that, right?", "Neil: That’s correct, yeah. You’ve gotta remember, again, that in 1999, the library of titles on DVD was measured in the dozens, not the thousands.", "But very quickly, it became apparent that giving people a tool to find the next interesting thing to watch was gonna be important for subscriber satisfaction, member satisfaction.", "But also, the habit was for people to come in and search for the newest release, and we would rush to the store and buy a whole lot of copies of the new release, whatever it was.", "“Das Boot” was one of them, was one of the first new releases after I joined, the…", "Neil: Yeah. Which was chiefly distinguished by the fact that they printed the Side 1/Side 2 on the wrong side of the disc, and it really wasn’t clear.", "So you put the thing in, and then the thing started right in the middle of a really intense [inaudible] charging scene with rivets popping off and explosions and…", "Brian: Wait a minute, why do I have a memory of that? Like, did I actually watch that DVD? You literally just rang a bell in my head.", "I feel like that happened to me. Anyway, sorry, go ahead.", "Neil: It probably did. And then about 10 minutes in, you realize, “No, this isn’t the start of the DVD.”", "And you pull it out, and then it’s, “Yeah, okay. Let’s flip it over [inaudible].” Oh, there was so much broken stuff in those days.", "Neil: Yeah. So we needed to figure out a way that we weren’t shipping the newest copies of the newest titles to our members and then having them come back and sit on the shelf and nobody else ever wanted to watch them.", "And so, the idea of recommending stuff that they might not immediately have in mind but which they wanted to see, maybe all the titles, historic titles, was gonna be an important piece to making the business sustainable.", "If we could rent each title 10 or 20 times, it would become a sustainable business. If we were buying a title for $20 and renting it for part of a subscription, it was not gonna float for very long.", "Brian: So let me just underline this again. So the Recommendation engine is obviously something to help users, you know, find movies they might wanna watch, but also on your side of it, it’s a solution to inventory issues and profitability issue?", "Neil: That’s correct, yeah. We called it the “percent new problem,” that if 80% of what we shipped out of the door was a brand new disc, then it clearly was gonna be very expensive to run this business.", "And the recommendations was a way to solve that in a win-win way.", "Brian: So I’m gonna just throw this in here real quick. Just, you know, like we said, you join in ’99, it’s the height of the dot com bubble, 2000, the bubble bursts.", "I know you can only speak for yourself, but you’re only there for about a year, maybe a year and a half, when the bubble bursts.", "You can only speak for yourself, but were you ever concerned that, “Oh, maybe we’re one of these dot com companies that are gonna go under, we’re not gonna make it?”", "Neil: Of course. You know, the world was pretty strange. A little anecdote that probably comes from a few months later, but that’s quite relevant…", "Neil: I feel like Reed and the management of Netflix had always had in mind building a sustainable business from the beginning and so, you know, hence their focus on solving the new disc shipping problem, even though all of our peer companies, at the time, were raising piles of cheap money and using it to fund growth and gaining eyeballs and market share at almost any cost.", "And I remember a board meeting where the board members were puzzled as to why we weren’t spending money faster and growing faster, as opposed to trying to solve the problems of making the thing profitable.", "And within months, that kinda turned on it’s head, and the fact that we had gotten reasonably close to profitability meant that we were able to raise one more round and eke that out.", "It was touch and go, but we were able to get through to profitability and growth, in spite of the fact that the market for internet businesses at that point had slipped to extremely negative.", "Brian: Well, and you were one of the first, or possibly the first internet company, to IPO after the bubble burst.", "Neil: Yeah. As with all of these things, there’s a good measure of luck that. Luck favors the prepared mind, the prepared business, and we were fortunate that we had approached it with kind of a sound business idea in mind.", "Brian: Before we get to what we came here to talk about, the streaming stuff, I wondered if you wanted to say a little bit about the competition with Blockbuster.", "I mean, this is one of those classic, you know, “Harvard Business School Disruption from the Internet” sort of stories.", "Blockbuster ignored you guys for a while, enough time for you to get traction. But once Blockbuster came online—again, from your perspective, speaking for yourself—like, how worried were you about competition from them and competition from Walmart and people like that?", "Neil: Blockbuster was really the third wave of competition. The first wave was Walmart, and the second wave was Amazon.", "So we kind of faced a showdown with the world’s biggest retailer, followed by the world’s biggest e-tailer, and then Blockbuster came in as the world’s biggest video renter.", "But by that time, we had learned, I think, the benefit and virtue of being extremely focused on our customers, on delivering value that they needed and required.", "And I think what we saw, with Walmart, was that they didn’t really have the same level of focus and attention.", "And while it spooked the public markets and the stock price was in the toilet for a while, the actual outcome really was never particularly in doubt.", "We were able to keep growing, and we were able to be successful competing against Walmart. And then Amazon, I think, a little more smartly, decided to compete outside the U.S. and they launched LoveFilm in the UK.", "Brian: Right. They never actually launched in the U.S. a DVD rental service.", "Neil: And then Blockbuster finally woke up that this was a potential threat to their business, and they proceeded to copy our model pretty much exactly and launched that out at a slightly lower price, and we ended up competing on price for a bit.", "They goaded us into— “Goaded” is perhaps the wrong word, they stimulated us into thinking about tiers of service.", "So we would offer a 1-disc, a 2-disc, and a 3-disc plan at different price points so that we could have a low price point compete.", "But at the end of the day, it’s fascinating, we had lots of meetings where we debated all the ways we could respond to the Blockbuster threat.", "And we charted all kinds of new projects in the niche [inaudible] that we were gonna do. And in the end, it amounted to a great deal of running around and not much outcome.", "The thing that really mattered was sticking to the core and delivering a great service and a better performance than Blockbuster was able to do.", "And so, I think the learning that we took away from that was it was more important to focus on our customers and being great at making a great business than worrying about what the competitors are up to.", "And, you know, eventually, as history shows, Blockbuster overextended themselves and went bankrupt. And you know, I think, in that case, it was responding a little too late and then not really being able to put enough effort and focus on it to catch up with the lead and the advantage that we had.", "So it sounds like a bit of a David and a Goliath story, but in the end of the day, I think it’s probably not that uncommon for the incumbent to fail to notice the challenger until it’s too late to effectively respond.", "So this is the story that you see repeated from time to time.", "Brian: Well, you know, it’s probably not that uncommon, but what I would say is uncommon is that…and this is gonna lead us into streaming… is that it’s around 2007 to 2009 that Blockbuster is really vanquished.", "And you guys have proven your model, and you’re on top. At that exact same moment is when you start to move into this new business model.", "So what I would say is rare is, you know, you would expect you guys would maybe rest on your laurels for a bit and say, “We won” and celebrate for a bit, but you’re immediately moving into this new business model.", "Neil: Yes, that’s correct. The interesting challenge here, of course, is it’s a pretty different business that serves the needs of a somewhat different customer base that doesn’t necessarily overlap with the first one.", "And I think we had learned from the Blockbuster experience that focus on your customers, your growth customers, your new customers, is an important thing.", "And so I think we pivoted pretty hard to really fit the attention and focus on the streaming business.", "Yes, initially, it was pretty nascent. We had to piggy back it on top of our DVD rental subscription business because we were unable to put together a library of sufficiently compelling content to be a standalone business.", "Brian: But you know what, you know what? Let’s…hold on. I apologize for cutting in here. Let’s get into streaming with two questions, first of all.", "When the company was conceived… You know, Reed has, several times, given this quote that he didn’t call the company DVD By Mail, he called it Netflix.", "Was the idea always, eventually, to do delivery of video over the internet?", "Neil: Sure. And when you look back at broadband plans and pricing back in ’99, 2000, 2001, that seemed like a pretty out-there suggestion.", "Then as the years went by, it became more and more practical until, by 2007, it was quite feasible. That was about the time that YouTube started out too, doing streaming, consumer-generated, user-generated video…", "Brian: I was gonna say, that was my second question. Was there some moment or catalyst, perhaps YouTube, that was the tipping point that caused you guys to say, “Okay, now is the moment to jump in and try to make streaming happen”?", "Neil: Actually, I would say it was concurrent, but no, we had started working on internet delivery actually a couple of years before, three years I think, before YouTube came on the scene, and it was a bit stop and start.", "And at the time, internet speeds were far too low and video compression was far too poor for a real-time delivery.", "And so we were looking at something much closer to the DVD model of trickle it down overnight and then have it stored on a disc on a box.", "So it became pretty clear that that was not gonna be a very interesting model. I’m not sure whether we were thinking about streaming before YouTube or YouTube helped us to think about that.", "It’s exactly the same time we gave up on the disc storage model and started to think about real-time delivery and streaming to customers as they were watching.", "Brian: And so, you’re thinking of set top boxes? I know, obviously, Roku sort of incubated inside Netflix.", "Were those some of the early projects that you’re talking about?", "Neil: No, it was long before Roku. It was in like, 2003, 2004, we started prototyping a box that… If you remember, TiVo was the hot thing about then, and that was a TV receiver with a disc drive.", "And we were working with some contract manufacturers who were building similar boxes, you know, with a video processor and a hard disc, and we were cobbling together some software to be able to work with a thing like that because that was clearly how we start in the wrong direction that doesn’t go anywhere.", "And then, in the height of competition with Blockbuster, we cancelled all of those projects in favor of just winning.", "And then when Blockbuster finally diminished as an existential threat, we were able to get back. And at that point, it was like, “Okay, well, we’ll skip those things, go straight to streaming.”", "Brian: Okay, so this is around…in 2007, I know, is when the first, I think, streaming products come to market.", "So when do you think that you start working on it in earnest?", "Neil: Oh, it was probably 2006, something like that, we kinda had a model and…", "Brian: There were so many other streaming experiments around that time, like MovieBeam, Movielink, you know, Unbox or something, I can’t even…there was dozens of ’em.", "And iTunes Video Rental starts to come out around the same time. So what is it that makes you guys wanna go into this crowded field that, seemingly, no one had had success with before?", "Neil: I don’t recall it being as crowded as you are painting now. It feels to me like a lot of those things were a bit later.", "There was the ill-fated Enron project to “stream across fiber networks that they would own and deploy”, which, in retrospect, seems awfully quaint.", "Of course, we all know what happened to Enron. But that was maybe the thing that I recall was being most present in our minds as we thought about streaming.", "Like, “What is this thing, and how can this possibly work? And the economics are just gonna be completely crazy.”", "Yeah, anyway. That was a novelty. As far as streaming was concerned, YouTube demonstrated the feasibility of the technology, and there wasn’t a lot that was… When iTunes came along, you’ll remember that it was a download model, it was not a streaming model.", "Neil: And for the first several years, you pressed a button and you waited several hours while the thing trickled down to your disc on your laptop or your device.", "Brian: You know what, you’re right because I’m thinking…", "Brian: I’m thinking of the Apple TV model, not the original iTunes model. You’re right about that.", "Neil: Yeah. Even the Apple TV model, when the Apple TV first came out, that was a… I think I’m right.", "It had a disc in it, you pressed a button and you waited and it might take 20 minutes to buffer enough to be able to start watching.", "Brian: Okay, so that’s a perfect entree into, what are the issues that you guys are having to deal with, you know, ranging from things like bandwidth, the technical issues of like audiovisual quality and things like that?", "So, in around 2006, you said, 2007, you’ve decided that you wanna do a streaming product. What are the roadblocks and what are the problems that you guys have to solve?", "Neil: Well, the good news is that there are a bunch of off-the-shelf pieces that we can assemble to make this feel more real.", "We were able to go to Windows Media Player, and that was a Windows app that played media from your machine.", "And we wrapped that in a…in a wrapper that basically managed the streaming, dynamically assembled a video file on your disc, and then Windows Media Player added to play the content.", "Windows Media Player also had Windows Media DRM that enabled us to satisfy studio requirements that this not be a vehicle for piracy, for a source of stolen copies, that we would protect the content that went out.", "And so were able to piggy back on top of that, and then we were able to leverage ACMI[SP] as a CBM. I think the key insight that we’ve had was that we chose to use HTTP to deliver a file, rather than to use RTP or one of these other streaming protocols.", "And we stayed away from all of the stuff that was being developed at the time in terms of smart streaming protocol, smart streaming engines, where the server was an integral part of delivering the content and where user firewalls and user networks had to be properly configured to listen to a new protocol.", "By sticking with HTTP, we were leveraging the basic capabilities that deliver a webpage in a way that would seamlessly work almost everywhere.", "So we put together those pieces, and I would say the technology that we built, there was a lot of tape and veiling wire and that was pretty tricky, but it was good enough to say, “This is an interesting possibility.”", "The flip side of this is that the content team was trying to assemble a library of content to stream, and that was extremely difficult because of the way video licensing works.", "That essentially, we’re competing with terrestrial broadcasters to acquire the rights to a title, and that can be pretty expensive, especially for a small business with just a handful of customers.", "And so, it was very difficult to get compelling content, certainly nothing that was new or current, it was all extreme, long-tail, deep catalog stuff at the time.", "And it was a good supplement to the DVD rental business. We would be able to provide people with something to watch if they happen to run out of DVDs at home, and they could at least click and watch.", "They could browse catalogs, pick something interesting, say, “That’s what I wanna see,” click the button, and have it start playing within a few seconds, and go through it.", "So it was a great technology demo with a great introduction to some of the challenges of building a content library, but it got us off the ground.", "Brian: Right. So that first product is, you know, on your computer desktop. How soon into that do you start to go out to other platforms?", "I think it was LG, maybe I’m wrong about that, was maybe the first consumer electronics partnership, but then, you know, things like Xbox, PS3, things like that.", "So do you start working on that right away because you realize, you know, only so many people are gonna watch on their desktop?", "Neil: The chronology here is that, almost as soon as we had launched we went into hardware, and we started to build the thing that became the Roku platform, the Roku box, way back in 2007, and put a lot of effort into that.", "Part-way through, I think, most of the way through that development effort, we also engaged with the Microsoft Xbox team, and we started working on an app for the Xbox 360.", "In the end, I think the… If I have it right, I think the Roku box was first out and it ended up being Roku, the standalone company, rather than the box from Netflix.", "And the reason for that is that we realized that we were going to want to work with all of the CE manufacturers and other partners.", "The Xbox project had demonstrated the appeal. And so, we thought it would be a lot easier if we didn’t have our own competing hardware solution in-house.", "And so, by selling up Roku as a standalone entity and freeing him up to go through competing streaming opportunities, we paved the path for working with Xbox, working with Sony PlayStation, and as you say, working with LG and Samsung.", "Brian: So that’s interesting. I just wanna underline that again. The reason you spin off Roku is because then you can be sort of a neutral partner to all of these other hardware manufacturers.", "“We’re not doing hardware in-house. We’re just giving you this platform, and you can put it on your hardware.”", "Brian: What’s the big break… Maybe that’s not what I wanna ask, but was Xbox and things like that, those were the first big breakthroughs, even before we get into the era of all these smart TVs that start coming out?", "Neil: Oh, for sure. Smart TVs were still way down the road. So we did the Xbox thing. It was an interesting quirk that…there were a bunch of things about the Xbox deal that were a little difficult.", "One of them was an exclusivity piece. And so, we did start working with Sony for their PlayStation platform, but Microsoft had a year of complete exclusivity, and so we didn’t get Sony until a year later.", "And then, the next year, they had an exclusivity on a game console app, and so we actually…we built a BD-Java application on a Blu-ray disc.", "Your listeners may not remember them, but Blu-rays had just about replaced DVDs by kind of the late 2000s.", "And the content protection scheme was based on actually having a full-out Java implementation that was able to execute Java code on the Blu-ray disc.", "And, in fact, it was that BD-Java that was the authoring environment for all of the menuing and setup and control for Blu-ray discs.", "And we actually, in an amazing effort, we were able to build a complete streaming player using the BD-Java and delivering it on a disc to Sony PlayStation.", "And so, for the second year, we actually had PlayStation streaming, but not from a [inaudible], but from a piece of code delivered on a plastic disc, which is an interesting irony.", "Brian: I think I remember that too, actually. What was…?", "Neil: Along the way, we took the software platform that we had developed before Roku was spun out, and we generalized that into an SEK[SP].", "I should put an asterisk on that, that generalization took years and is still ongoing at some level. But we were able to take that and deliver it to LG and Samsung.", "But not for smart TVs, it was for Blu-ray players at the time. Smart TVs were still a couple of years in the future, and Blu-ray players had…a process of it was fast enough to do streaming.", "And so, it was a credible place to go build a streaming app, and that’s what we did.", "Neil: Another thing you have to remember here is that the capabilities of the early Roku box and of the LG and Samsung players were somewhat limited.", "And so we didn’t actually build a…what I would call a “discovery and selection UI.” We leveraged the queue concept that all of our DVD members were familiar with, and we allowed you to build a list of the titles you might be interested in.", "And then the UI on the LG Blu-ray player or the Samsung Blu-ray player just basically showed one long list of titles, which were things that you had added to your streaming queue, streaming list.", "And so, it was a very, very simple-done user interface, but it was enough to get going and begin to make things happen.", "And it wasn’t until a couple of years later that we started to add a real choosing and selection…discovery and selection UI on top of that.", "Brian: And then that’s probably when you were into the smart TV era and things like that?", "There was a lot of skepticism at the time that the Wi-Fi would actually work for streaming, and it often didn’t.", "Neil: That’s right. And, you know, I’ll just say, we grew beyond LG and Samsung and pretty most of manufacturers of Blu-ray disc players, and then… The disc player and the TV are actually not that different when you dig inside.", "It’s a pretty similar chip inside. And soon as TVs started to add networking in meaningful numbers..and we pushed hard to have them add Wi-Fi.", "There was a lot of skepticism at the time that the Wi-Fi would actually work for streaming, and it often didn’t.", "It’s hard to imagine today, where Wi-Fi is super robust and generally works pretty well. But early Blu-ray players and smart TVs typically had a wired connection and no Wi-Fi, and you had to run a wire out to your TV, which was an unusual thing, for sure.", "But yeah, we got past that and eventually got good Wi-Fi in these boxes and made it work well.", "Brian: Well, I want to point out for the listeners an interesting parallel here, which I’m sure you’re aware of, but back in the DVD-by-mail days, Netflix grew by…", "As DVD is a technology that’s being adopted and people are buying DVD players for the first time, one strategy that Netflix used heavily was you get a new DVD player, inside the box comes these coupons to try out Netflix.", "So it’s almost serendipitous that, again, as this universe of devices starts to come out, as these smart TVs start to come out, you sort of pursue the same strategy of, “You’ve got this new $3,000 smart TV.", "What are you gonna do with it? Well, look, Netflix is there.”", "Neil: That’s right. You’ve kinda rewound the clock by a bunch of years. In fact, it was an innovation from the very earliest attempts to market the DVD service in early 2000, 2001, that we came up with the idea of… I shouldn’t say we, I wasn’t anything to do with marketing at that point.", "This was Leslie Kilgore and her predecessor, and they came up with the idea of, red tickets in the box were good for three or five DVD rentals.", "And then we had the painful problem, when we introduced streaming, of converting that into, you know, “It says three rentals.", "It actually means a month of free service”. And it was a little bit of hand waving for you to tell there’s a slight difference in the service we were trying to do, but it was obviously a better deal for consumers.", "And then, eventually, yes, that became end [SP] streaming, and the red ticket morphed into other things.", "And in many ways, we continue that same partner marketing plan of including some periods of free subscription in with the purchase of new devices, and that’s been a hugely effective vehicle.", "Brian: You know what, it occurs to me we do need to back up for a second. When you first launched streaming, what is the uptake, like, that you noticed?", "Like, how quickly do you see existing Netflix users using streaming?", "Neil: That’s a great question. I don’t have numbers at my fingertips, but it was pretty slow at first.", "This was a fringe activity that was relevant to eager consumers, early adopters, who had superior home networking and who had the technical savvy to be able to, you know, download our app or to go buy a Roku box or find a high-end DVD player which happened to have an app on it.", "And these are the things that took off slowly. And, you know, the content was not strong at first, it took a while to start building a strong content library.", "Brian: So the content library needs to catch up, the actual installed base of devices that can do the streaming needs to catch up, so it’s not an overnight thing.", "Neil: That’s right. And there was a lot of hard work that Reed and others went through in sort of selling the story on both sides.", "You know, to the hardware manufacturers, “This is gonna be huge, and you should work with us because it’s gonna be a really big piece.”", "And to the content owners that, “You should sell us content because we’re gonna be able to deliver it effectively.”", "And, you know, [inaudible] when we started, and so there was a lot of building the credibility on both sides of the business to make it go.", "Brian: Let’s go back to, also, some of the technical details. You know, famously, you guys start using AWS very early on.", "Just some of the… Once it does start to take off…we’ll fast forward to that. So once it starts to become a thing that, you know, a certain percentage of users are using and then it’s so popular it takes over a certain percentage of all internet traffic… So just the scaleability issues, the bandwidth issues, any of those things that you wanna go into or stories you wanna tell about that.", "Neil: Well, there was an interesting moment in the summer of, I think, 2008 when it was still primarily a DVD business, and the distinction in that is because, as a DVD business, the value delivered to consumers is through the DVDs they have at home.", "And if the website is not up, well, they can come back tomorrow and order a new disc for the next day, and it’s not an egregious failure.", "But at that point, streaming was beginning to become interesting, and we knew it was gonna be the future.", "Amazon had just launched AWS at the time and so we concluded, after a lot of discussion, that if we’re gonna rebuild for redundancy and failover, we should do it in the newest architecture that’s available and not try to build on our legacy stuff.", "At that point, we had a database hardware failure that corrupted the main database that we ran on, and it was an ugly mess.", "It took most of the day to get the consumer-facing website back live again, and it took several days to get our logistics system back up and going again.", "And I’d say a lot of people tore out a lot of hair and lost a lot of sleep during those three days. And it became very clear that, as a streaming business, that kind of downtime was not acceptable, that we needed to have a much higher availability, and that we were gonna need to re-architect our systems to have redundancy and failover and all of the things that are necessary for that kind of improved uptime.", "And we could look at building a duplicate data center and putting the Oracle and Java stuff in it, that we had at that point, or we could look to something completely different.", "Amazon had just launched AWS at the time and so we concluded, after a lot of discussion, that if we’re gonna rebuild for redundancy and failover, we should do it in the newest architecture that’s available and not try to build on our legacy stuff.", "And so, we chose to start from scratch and move our systems over to AWS piece by piece starting in 2008.", "And that was an odyssey that ended taking us about eight years…four years for the majority of it and eight years to clean up the last pieces and unplug our data center.", "And, yeah, lots of interesting stories along the way. The key one is that we recognized immediately that to do a fork of our legacy system into AWS was not gonna get us what we wanted, we needed to re-architect with the structure of AWS in mind.", "And we needed to switch to things like NoSQL databases, instead of trying to use bigger and bigger Oracle installations.", "And we needed to switch to a micro services architecture, instead of a sort of monolithic client server architecture attached to the Oracle database.", "And, in order to do that, we wondered about, “Do we try to build a selection of the complete service top to bottom and then bring that off in AWS?", "We can parallel with the current stuff and then shift customers over, a few at a time? Or instead, do we try to take this feature by feature and implement portions of our system in AWS, while leaving portions left back in the legacy architecture?”", "And it was that latter approach that we chose and I think it was the right decision. I think it got us a lot more experience with how to work with AWS and how to use the services, while deferring, kind of finishing up everything in order to get anything going at all.", "One of the implications, though, is that we spent months building scaffolding that was to real-time replication of our Oracle database in our legacy data center to the databases to the databases we were trying to use inside AWS that would copy data backward and forward in various different ways.", "We called this phase the “Phase of Roman Rising.” Certainly, we had a lot of challenges and frustrations with keeping that scaffolding robust and stable.", "But in the end, it enabled us to move page by page and feature by feature from the legacy data center into AWS and gradually build and gain confidence with, “This is the right way to go” and then move faster and faster until it was all done.", "So it’s a…a critical moment there right after…actually, it was right before the iPhone 3 launched. iPhone 3, you’ll recall, was the first iPhone that had third-party apps available.", "And Apple had instructed[SP] us to build a streaming app for the iPhone 3, and in true Apple form, they had only given us about a month’s notice of what they wanted us to do.", "And so, we rushed to build the iPhone app. The app was actually pretty easy, but what would it talk to?", "We needed to build capabilities to serve user interface and the streaming content to the iPhone. And we debated extensively for a couple of days, and then we decided that, really, the only way forward here was to build this in AWS.", "We didn’t have time to build a backup first in our old legacy data center, and so were faced with a big launch of the Apple WWDC, predicated on our new AWS architecture working well.", "And it was certainly a bit of a nail biting moment for us, but it was a success and it gave us great confidence that AWS was the right way forward.", "And from then on, everything new we built was AWS only.", "Brian: That was actually gonna be one of my questions because here you guys are originally trying to build for set top devices, for TVs, and things like that.", "So did the whole mobile viewing and, you know, the app economy, did that all kind of take you by surprise a bit?", "Neil: I think it was pretty clear that these are gonna be good devices, but certainly the idea that the iPhone was gonna have third-party apps on it was… well, [inaudible] wasn’t obvious until it was, you know, kind of made public.", "Neil: I’m trying to remember the timing here. There was a tablet, too, and I think maybe it was the tablet that was… You know, the first iPad was the first device that we got onto, and then the iPhone followed a few months later.", "Brian: I mean, because…was it even obvious to you guys that people would want to stream over a tiny screen, the handheld screen?", "Neil: It still might not be obvious! There’s some differences in behavior in how people use the small screen versus the big screen.", "Neil: Oh, if you’re watching on a TV, you tend to ignore the phone. If you’re watching on the phone, the phone call comes in, you get interrupted, and so, you know, we end up with shorter viewing sessions.", "I think that somewhat influences the kind of content, just content that people watch on phones it’s content that’s easy to stop and start.", "And then, nowadays, of course, we’ve…you know, fast forward many years into the future, we’ve implemented downloading on phones.", "And so, you know, people are now taking it with them on planes and on trains and on long commutes and in parts of the world where there isn’t a, you know, stable home connection sometimes.", "So, you know, certainly, the world and the environment has changed a bunch and the phone is a nice complement to a smart TV, it’s a way to watch content.", "Brian: One more technical question and then we’ll try to bring it into the present day a bit. You guys, I feel like, have always been like really at the forefront of pushing…so you got streaming to work in a big way.", "You were the first ones to really, you know, crack that nut, but you were always pushing like audiovisual standards as well, like, you know, pushing HD and then moving into 4K.", "And so, was that always a goal as well, where it’s not just enough to get people movies on demand, we have to get them movies that are as high-quality as they could get from any piece of content?", "Neil: I would say it was, in many ways, a reaction to YouTube being seen as lower quality video.", "Neil: I think that we… We worried about being tarred with the same brush that, you know, Netflix streaming is an inferior brush.", "So we wanted to get out in front and say, “No, we can deliver the best quality AV. We can beat DVDs. We can beat Blu-ray.", "We can be first to market with 4K. We can be a leader with high dynamic range.” The big advantage of delivering over the internet is that you don’t have to upgrade an entire infrastructure in order to be able to deliver a new format.", "And so, we’ve been able to be pushing the lead in a lot of these things. And it’s been kinda fun working with…now, of course, we’re into original content…so working with the big-name producers and directors to put this together in the highest-quality formats available.", "Brian: Well, before we get to the original content era, I have to ask about Quickster. We don’t have to spend an hour on it or even two minutes, but just whatever you wanna say about the thinking going into that, but maybe more importantly, the lesson that you guys learned from that experience.", "Neil: Yeah, that’s a great question. In the Blockbuster fight, we had learned the importance of focusing on new customers and the future.", "At at that point, we were a business that was delivering DVDs and streaming on the same subscription, and we were charging $8 for the DVDs and $10 for the combined plan.", "And we were spending probably comparable amounts of money licensing streaming content as we were buying DVDs.", "And so, clearly, an $8 plus $2 didn’t work, we needed to start to collect revenue for the streaming plan that was commensurate with the quality of the content that was available, but by this time was much much better.", "And so, we needed to separate it into two plans and let people choose either DVD or streaming or both and charge a real amount of money for the streaming.", "We were so eager not to make the mistake that most businesses do of ignoring the new business in favor of the legacy business that we were a bit too bold and a bit too eager to make the switch over, and so we kind of spinned into it.", "And we certainly…at this point, [inaudible] bunch of customers with some heavy-handed pricing stuff where we could’ve done somewhat better, I think, by looking to the future customer and being a bit more generous with the pre-existing customer, the customer who got us where we were going.", "But in the end, I look at the Quickster episode, not as a disaster that we not only avoided, but as a critical business transition, a discontinuity that we needed to go through that was gonna be painful, no matter how we did it.", "We didn’t do it perfectly, but we survived and we did accomplish the mission of ending up with a team that was dedicated and focused on streaming and so was able to grow the streaming business.", "And today, dvd.com is a separate division in a separate building. They’re focused on the DVD customers, doing very nicely, and the streaming business is focused on the streaming customers.", "And because they’re different and non-overlapping, minimally overlapping, I should say, we’re able to build the features and capabilities relevant for each side and it’s successful.", "I think, had we not gone through some of the pain of the Quickster period that we might not even be here today at all.", "Brian: So maybe you, you know, modern business theory says you should disrupt yourself, but maybe you guys just did it a little too aggressively.", "I think the piece that many people miss [about Qwikster] is that it was a transition that needed to happen.", "Neil: Yeah, that’s a pretty fair assessment. We were certainly intent on disrupting ourselves, and we did it rather nicely.", "We could’ve been more sophisticated about it, but I think the piece that many people miss is that it was a transition that needed to happen.", "If we hadn’t have done it or if we’d been to timid about it, you know, we probably wouldn’t be where we are today.", "Brian: So again, to bring us into the modern-day era, in the DVD rental era by mail, you buy the physical discs and you can rent them out time and again to people.", "But into the streaming era, it’s a completely different ballgame, you have to acquire the rights to stream content.", "And so early on, because everyone thinks that this is an experiment, maybe even you guys think it’s an experiment, it’s not super expensive to get these rights.", "But then, as the streaming takes off and, as we talked about with the Quickster, you’re seeing this is the business going forward, that becomes more expensive, and then that’s the reason why you realize you need to go into creating your own content right?", "Neil: Yeah. I’m gonna have to put a big caveat on this, that my role as the technology guy, Chief Product Officer, by this point, the technology really had relatively little to do with the content.", "Neil: Ted Sarandos is the architect of the content stuff, so he’s the guy who you should probably do a follow-up episode with and…at some point in the future.", "Brian: Well, obviously, we’d love to, but you know what, let me tee it up, though. I actually was doing that to tee it up to a technical question, which is that, you know, we talked… Early on you were coming up with recommendations and things like that and you guys used personalization and data very early on to help the business.", "But from the technical standpoint, once you get into streaming, you have loads more data about what people are actually watching, about what they’re actually interested in.", "So maybe talk about that, about how once you’re you in the streaming era, like, what you can learn about user behavior potentially transforms what Netflix can do.", "Neil: Yeah, that’s a great point. The recommendation stuff we started out with in 1999 and through the DVD era was…it was important, but it was kind of the sweetener on top of the system.", "We didn’t have great feedback as to what people had watched and enjoyed. We knew what we’d sent them, we had hard data on which discs we’d sent, but we didn’t know which discs they’d actually watched and which ones they’d enjoyed.", "And so, right from 1999, 2000, we built the star bar, the five-star thing that’s become such a popular internet meme, because we needed to collect data, “This is a terrible movie” “This is a wonderful movie” and “This is an okay movie” to be able to feed back.", "And we collected a lot of that. I think we probably collected 5 million ratings a day, but still relatively small, compared to the shipping volume.", "And if people didn’t give us ratings, then it was very hard to predict accurately for them.", "But with streaming, you actually have much better data. You see which titles people really engage with and which ones they watched a few minutes of and then turned off again.", "And so, that quality enjoyment data is actually probably better than the star data. The star data tends to be viewed as, “Well, this is a high-quality movie, whether or not I enjoyed it,” you know.", "So maybe it rates production value and sort of perceived value of the story rather than enjoyment value…", "Brian: Like, you might give, say, I don’t know, “King’s Speech” five stars because you know it won Best Picture, but maybe you didn’t really like it", "and maybe you didn’t even finish it. But now, with streaming, you can see, “Oh, they would tell us it’s five stars, but they stopped after 1:20.”", "Neil: Exactly. And the two examples from the era that I like to use for that, you know, “Schindler’s List” and “Hotel Rwanda,” both really good movies, but not necessarily what you wanna watch tonight.", "You know, really dark, deep, provocative, thought-provoking things, but you know, “Tonight, I just want something that I can lean back to and enjoy.”", "And so yeah, the streaming feeling data sort of gives us that enjoyment factor, which is much more valuable, and it gives us complete coverage too.", "And so, we’re able to use that pretty effectively to drive suggestions and recommendations.", "more than 80% of everything that people watch on Netflix is influenced, to some degree, by the personal information that we’ve brought to bear.", "The search feature on our system drives a small amount of viewing, it’s in the teens percent, I think.", "And search itself has a little bit of recommendations and suggestions built in. It’s designed to [inaudible] you, if you’ve got a small number of titles presented, then we know, roughly, what you might be aiming for.", "But everything that’s not search has a strong component of personalization and predicted enjoyment built in.", "And so, it’s true to say that more than 80% of everything that people watch on Netflix is influenced, to some degree, by the personal information that we’ve brought to bear.", "And that delivers a lot of value for our members and a lot of value for us, in terms of making Netflix just the key place, the place that people come back to every night.", "Brian: Well, and also helps you figure out, now that you are producing your own content, what would be the content to produce that your users would actually want to view.", "Neil: Sure, but there’s an assumption there that I wanna challenge. We don’t write stories by data. Stories have to be organic and intact, and so we trust a producer or a team to craft an interesting story.", "But we are able to take the outlines, the pitch, the casting choices, the various decisions that go around that and plug that in to get an idea of who’s gonna be interested, which helps us to know if this is an economically feasible project.", "And so, using the data to make funding decisions is a different game than using the data to tune the story, which we don’t do.", "Brian: One more question and then I’ll let you go. You’ve been so generous with your time. I saw you give a talk where you discussed how, not only are you…you know, everything’s in the cloud, you’re delivering content streaming.", "But as part of the production process, as you’re producing content, you’re also using some of this cloud technology and these cloud services to help streamline production as well?", "Neil: Yeah. You know, there’s an aside that I have to make here [inaudible] an introduction. Everything’s in the cloud except our CDN.", "OpenConnect is another important piece of the story that we haven’t talked about at all.", "Brian: And we should say, CDN is Content Delivery Network. Sorry, go ahead.", "Neil: That’s correct. So to make streaming work effectively, you don’t want to be streaming… Particularly, we’re streaming to 192 and a half countries around the world, the half is Ukraine without Crimea.", "You gotta get the content close to the subscriber, you don’t want it [inaudible 01:05:35] on the fiber optic pipes under the ocean.", "You know, the kinds of volumes we do that doesn’t work. And so, we have content servers all over the world in thousands of locations, in many cases, actually installed into ISP’s infrastructure and they write it…they", "[inaudible] in their system so that there’s a minimum amount of “internet structural backbone” that’s the first [inaudible].", "And we put a lot of effort into building very small, very power-efficient, exceedingly effective delivery devices that can stream, you know, most of 100 Gigabytes a second out of a relatively small footprint.", "And the stack of the listings installed in an IX or an ISP’s infrastructure is really key to delivery, and that’s been an important piece of building to the scale we’ve got today.", "So I certainly wanna mention the team that’s been working hard on that because that’s an important piece of the story.", "If you’ll remind me your real question, I think just close out on the right topic…", "Brian: That I saw you mention that you’re using things like the cloud and things like that on the production side, so that it’s easier for your actual, you know, original productions to do things more efficiently.", "Neil: Got it, right. So yes, we are producing this year 400 original titles for, I think, 1,000-plus hours of content, and that makes us one of the bigger production studios in the world.", "And, of course, there’s lots of opportunity for IT to support an operation like making a series or making a movie, all the way from the planning stages, where we’re receiving pitches and scripts and we’re soliciting opinions and getting feedback, and where we’re making decisions and working through legal contracts and planning and scheduling and booking casts and sets and renting equipment and delivering it to the locations.", "All of this stuff is an opportunity for IT to make it more efficient, more effective. And then, into the production phase, where we wanna be able to capture the daily shoots, bring them home so people maybe in another country be able to see the daily takes and see what’s going on, through to the editing.", "We subtitle in 20-something languages, 23 or 25, I think. We [inaudible 01:08:38] languages, and so the localization and the post-production work.", "So all this process in an area where, rather than acquire or license the conventional tooling to do this stuff, it’s an area where we’ve chosen to invest in building cloud-based technology.", "And the vision that I’ve tried to bring to life here, and so still a few years from being anything like tangible yet, is that there’s kind of a dashboard of a production that a director or a producer can carry around on their mobile device.", "And they can see yesterday’s tapes and today’s scripts and the planning for tomorrow, and they can make sure that everything’s lined up, and they can look to see what did they do last year in the previous season", "and then what’s going on on this other side. And, you know, it’s the dashboard that brings the data from all the phases of the current production and all the acquired knowledge from all the other productions that we’ve done in a way that provides us with…that will provide us, when it’s fully realized, an amazing tool for efficient production of original content.", "And so, I think that’s a really exciting possibility that we’re investing in heavily at the moment.", "Brian: Well, Neil, I believe you are leaving Netflix in July, is it?", "Brian: So my last question is really simple, and if it’s too personal, you can be vague. But what are your plans for life post-Netflix?", "Neil: I’ve been continuously employed since I was 16 or 17 years old, and I’m gonna take a bunch of months, maybe a year or two, to just go through the things that appeal.", "Travel, I’m a big outdoors person, I love to bike and kayak and climb mountains. And I’m gonna be doing all of those things here in my home in California and around the world, and that’s gonna be fun.", "I’m expecting, though, that at some point, I’ll wanna get back into building something. And I find, at this point, there are sort of three areas that are particularly appealing to me, the area of precision medicine, so", "healthcare augmented by technology and big data and machine learning. The area of education, I think that learning is going through a big transformation, and we need to make it much more effective and affordable and available.", "And then alternative energy, I feel like the opportunity to apply technology to solving some of the climate crisis problems is a good one too.", "So those three areas are particularly appealing to me. I don’t know if I’ll find something that’s compelling and where I can make a difference, but that’s something I’d like to imagine is in my future.", "Brian: Yeah, well, good luck if you do one or maybe all three of those things. But Neil Hunt, thank you so much for coming on the show, giving us just a wonderful background history of Netflix, of the streaming product.", "But also, thank you for sharing a really, really fascinating career.", "Neil: Well, thank you for the opportunity. And I would be remiss if I didn’t note that there’s about 2,000 people here now at Netflix and [inaudible 00:12:33] who’ve worked with me and around me and on my team and on my care teams over the past 18 years that I’ve been at Netflix.", "And it’s been an extraordinary experience, and I really I’m very fortunate to have worked with so many smart and sharp people.", "And that’s been great, so I thank them all as well. You know who you all are, if you’re listening to this.", "[…] Netflix’s response to these problems was reflective of how the management was focused on building a sustainable business model, as opposed to growing up too fast.", "Instead of focusing on building a huge content library the company instead optimized their DVD-on-mail solution for their existing library.", "This business decision was what helped the company survive the crash that followed the dot com bubble.", "[…] Fascinating InternetHistory podcast examining the history of Netflix provided by Chief Product Officer Neil Hunt who interestingly is stepping down in July after 18 years at the company during which he oversaw their move into SVOD powered by AWS: […]"]}

Me and me living under a rock or just that, like this history of Netflix is not told that both red box and Roku come out of Netflix like it's crazy.", "They've had more spin-offs than they have their own acquisitions. I think they've only ever acquired one company.", "I know what their first was. I don't know if there were other ones after that. And the, their first was quite recent, but the Roku thing.", "Just one more note on this. I tried to do a bunch of research to figure out when they spun it out, what did the ownership structure look like?", "You're totally not living under a rock cause I looked through the entire Roku and a couple times it mentions Netflix as.", "Obviously they have a large dependency on Netflix is business. It mentions in two places a lease like that they shared with Netflix in the sort of early days, but it doesn't mention anything about like Netflix is part of the founding story of the company.", "Uh, Reed Hastings nor Netflix appears on the cap table, uh, when they're going public of sort of major shareholders, which is interesting because Netflix invested $6 million when they spun it off.", "But I wonder if they've just been diluted so much. Well, one other thing that's $6 million. I tried to find more information on that to figure out like if there was a valuation on the company, if they, what it looked like a, there is a form D filed on Edgar, which is the SCCs website that you can go to that shows an investment.", "It doesn't name Netflix or just names, Reed Hastings.

You get to read half the previous page and half of the next page while you're looking at this document and scrolling through it.", "So it's like one of these things that's like, you really have to scour to find anything. And then you can't find that much other than the fact that it was killed and spun out.", "Amazing. And this is now a, you know, billion and a half dollar market cap, public company. Crazy. So.", "That's the story of the dentist, of the one half of the streaming business for Netflix, which is the distribution getting, getting, you know, content into people's homes.", "But, but it turns out the other half of the streaming business, the content side. Quite frankly proves to be the harder half over the coming years, or at least the more capital intensive half.", "So unlike DVD rental that Ben was addressing in the followup in the beginning of the show at the top of the episode, unlike DVD rental, there's no first sale doctrine here, so to stream.", "Content will be it, you know, shows or films to people via service.

In October, 2008 with starters to get all of their content for $25 million.", "So this is TV shows, movies, their back catalog, everything that they have the rights to. Um, uh, stars quickly comes to regret that, but it's only a two year attempt to stars to stars actually own the rights to all those movies that they're putting on their sort of like.", "Hi hundreds cable channels. So I believe the way this works, this is, I'm mostly conjecturing here, but I'm recalling my old days as a media TMT investment banker.", "Uh, around this time, I believe the way it works is that stars had negotiated with the, with the content production company, but Disney Fox, you know, whoever NBC who had originally made the movies and TV shows, um, they had acquired the rights to show them on cable.", "And I believe.

Once again, just like we saw with Netflix in part one, this is like instant product market fit. So you know, everybody who, uh, has is any inkling of watching video on a, you know, computer or mobile devices or emerging any screen at this point.", "So, you know, mostly millennials and younger, but, um, but lots of other people too.", "I mean, YouTube has been around for several years at this point. They just go nuts. And this is drives tons of signups for Netflix.", "Even during the recession. It's an a way better product. I mean like why would you, the old paradigm is you only want a video when it's on TV.", "You know when you, what you want is on versus you can watch it whenever you want, wherever you want.", "Like that's a no brainer. Customer value prop there. And I remember in the summer of 2008. Previous to that I wasn't able to do Netflix's, what do they call it, like instant watch or watch now feature?", "I think it was instant cue. You had your regular Netflix queue for DVDs, and then the instant queue was your queue of what you wanted to watch, you know, lined up, uh, via streaming and you're so right.", "Yeah. And, and you could only, it only worked on windows because like, they just hadn't. They hadn't gotten around to building the sort of Mac client for it yet.", "And then when they did, you had to like use, I can't remember what browser it was, but only worked at one browser and you needed silver light.", "The way that this works today and the way that it used to work, it was just the cloogy iest way that you could imagine trying to, like, it would take 15 minutes to get the video sort of set up on your computer so you could watch it.", "This was the only reason I had silver light installed on my computers.", "Wow. How quickly we forget. This is, you know, 2009, 2010. Netflix is just, but they've beaten blockbuster at this point.", "Yes, they're competing with Redbox, but like, they're the only game in town when it comes to streaming.", "They're having a Bonanza just adding subscribers, uh, like there's no tomorrow. And so much so that by 2010, uh, Ben gave the stat that, uh, today Netflix is still 15% of all us internet traffic.", "Back then in 2010, they were 20% of all us internet traffic. Oh, wow. Internet guru. Yeah. I assume, uh, well think about how much more streaming video there is now versus in 2010.", "Um, right. Yeah. It probably wasn't 68% of the internet or what, 58% of the internet then. Yeah. I mean, of course there was YouTube, much smaller than one state, but you know, there was no, uh, there was no Amazon prime streaming.", "There was no Facebook video. There was no Snapchat, there was no Instagram, nothing infrastructure wise.", "There also wasn't gigabit to the home. Then. Yup. Yup, yup. And Netflix already knew this was the future.", "This is like not just the future. This is now. So they realize they need to sign up as much content as possible and just keep this, keep this train running.", "So they're willing, the content companies are also seeing this and saying, Oh wow, we can extract a lot of dollars out of Netflix.", "Netflix says, we're happy to pay dollars. We've got subscribers coming out the wazoo. They sign in 2010 a remember their first deal was started.", "$800 million deal, five year deal with epics, epi X. Now epics was a joint venture between paramount, um, which is part of a Viacom.", "Lionsgate paramount was the, the film, uh, studio of Viacom, lion's gate, independent and MGM, which were.", "The two remaining major independent film studios. So they get all of their content, all the back catalog, all the new content that's coming out.", "And MGM, at the time, I remember I was working, uh, on wall street. They were facing bankruptcy, and so they desperately needed this cash.", "Um, and it was this Netflix deal that, uh, between epics, like really. Keeps a lot of these companies alive through the recession.", "Everyone else sees this, and they started coming back to stars and NBC come back.", "They'd demand much more money and Netflix realizes they need to get really smart. So they spin up a whole content acquisition department and they start spending a lot of money acquiring all this content.", "So there's, there's foreshadowing there. Netflix spending a lot of money on content. Okay. All right.", "It's coming back. But a quick, real quick detour about the media industry. So all of these content production companies, the media industry has been around for a hundred years.", "In the U S there has been tons of consolidation. They are either. Under the same parent company in the case of like time Warner, um, or, or, or very closely tied to the cable companies to the distribution, like content and distribution are all within the same house, if not directly, then at least they're, they're in bed together also going on as a, as a result of this cord cutting starts becoming a thing.", "Consumers are saying like, man, I'm getting so much great content from Netflix, from YouTube, from streaming, and it's the recession and you know, cash is tight.", "Do I really need to be paying 100 bucks a month for my. Cable subscription. So see, you've got the content side of the house, then you're saying is like very incentivize to do these deals, but the distribution side of the house is like, wait a minute, this is the thing.", "Accelerating our death. Can I, can we have a conversation for a minute? Yeah, exactly. So they, the distribution side of the house, the cable companies, they start getting very protective versus Netflix.", "Now what do the cable companies also own most of in the U S they own the broadband pipes too. People's homes, the most people in the U S at this point in time, and, and really still to this day, I would assume, are getting their internet connections in their homes that they're using the stream from their cable company, from time Warner cable, from Comcast, from whatever, from their cable modem.", "Quick side note, do you know about fast.com? Vaguely, but so forever. I use speed test.net to test my sort of upload and download Netflix.", "Was having all these issues through all the net neutrality stuff where as you're about to suggest the pipes did not like them because they were taking up most of the bandwidth but not paying anything special to be on them.", "So Netflix was getting throttled. So what did they do? They created fast.com and put it on the same IP block and on the same CDNs as their content.", "So then they were, they ran a big campaign and encouraged users, by the way, fast.com is a great way to check your upload and download it as far as sort of like simpler and lighter than speed test.", "Um. They encourage consumers, Hey, if you ever feel like, gosh, it might, why is my Netflix slow? Go to fast.com.", "Um, and, and compare that against however fast do you think your internet should be? And you'll get a, a reading of, uh, you know, uh, what your ISP is actually treating us as in terms of upload and download speed.", "Interesting. Well, of course then what you are referencing here is throttling the cable companies. The, the.", "I SPS, they start throttling Netflix because it's a competitive threat to their whole business model.", "So what does Netflix do? Reed Hastings is like, I can play politics. I know how this works.", "Remember back to part one. Uh, and his day is on the California board of education. He starts a PAC, a political action committee, uh, called, uh, not to support a particular political candidate.", "It's called Flix pack. Uh, and it's to lobby the FCC. To set up net neutrality rules. So if you, we all go back in the time machine a little bit here and start remembering, when did net neutrality start becoming a thing?", "When did we first start hearing about this? It was in 2010 and it was because of this and it was because of Netflix that really, uh, remember all these campaigns about like, you know, net neutrality and stop SOPA and all, all this stuff.", "Like who's behind it? David, some of us, some of us wrote a big. 40 page thesis paper on network neutrality in 2007 so like, you know, hipster net neutrality, you were just ahead of the curve.", "I was, it's the only time in my life I can ever claim that. And I remembered these big, huge, huge fights.", "And then finally at the end of end of 2010, Netflix wins and the FCC approves rules, essentially preventing ISP from, from blocking content that's under attack again today.", "I don't know actually the details of the latest FCC ruling.", "Um. This year or last year in the Trump administration, uh, I believe reversed a lot of this. This is one of those things I followed.", "And then the rest of the world's news got so insane that I lost the thread. Yeah. Yeah. Me too. I cannot speak authoritatively on this anymore.", "Anyway. Um, so 2010. Basically, it goes really well for Netflix.", "They're spending a lot of money, but they're, they're growing hugely. 2011 also starts on a very positive note.", "They finally launched international expansion. Now international was hard to do with the DVD rental business cause you needed, you know, basically cooperation of the national.", "Post office and all this infrastructure and everything.", "Um, but streaming, you know, it's just, it's just bits. It's not Adams. And it turns out a lot of the world speaks English too.", "And watches us, made a Hollywood, uh, video content. So first they expand first in Canada, naturally.", "And then before the end of the year in Mexico and Latin America. Um, and this becomes a huge, huge growth driver for them over the subsequent, throughout the 2010s.", "Now, international is a, a bigger business for Netflix. Then there, then their us business. Um, so all going well, they're still kind of on the top of the world here.", "And this is 2011, 2011. Yup. I don't think. We talked about the chaos monkey and the last show, correct?", "No, I don't know. We didn't even talk about the cat.", "Smokey. Go for it. Alright, so this is the, the time that Netflix decides we're fully now an internet company in a bigger way.", "You know that we're a streaming company, and so we need to be world-class at technology. And anybody that has that watches Netflix today sort of knows, like it is remarkably Bulletproof.", "Like that. It kind of always works. And how is that? Well, Netflix invented something that you can find on get hub now that's part of a larger suite of software that's open source in 2011 called the chaos monkey.", "And what the chaos monkey in its original incarnation did was it was a software package that you would turn on on the server and sort of on your, on your whole infrastructure, and it would just start pinging around all the different.", "You know, internals of your system and just kill random processes at will. It was literally a chaos monkey.", "Yeah. And, and what it would do, and the, the philosophy behind the whole thing was what better way to prevent failure than to always be failing and be able to construct systems that are extremely resilient and sort of fail gracefully instead of failing in a catastrophic manner.", "And so some of the original things that they did were. The experience could degrade where the resolution would get worse, or where your recommendations weren't available or your profile wasn't available, but you could always do the number one thing that people want to watch on Netflix, which is search for a thing and then watch it.", "And it's just crazy, impressive mentality that, you know, back in 2011, they're pioneering sort of like a, uh, it's actually, it's used in a ton of companies now.", "There's that book famously named chaos monkeys, about, uh, about Silicon Valley in general. It's sort of a brilliant infrastructure decision and just show the, uh, the sort of level of talent and the engineering department there.", "They still run it now like nine to five or something, so they don't have to wake people up in the middle of the night because the chaos monkey tip something over that that you know, was still sensitive.", "It's very, it's very humane, humane chaos monkey. That's well an apt analogy for what's about to happen here.", "I feel like this is also the story of the. Business side of the Netflix house, which is like, there's a chaos monkey running a monk, and they keep shooting themselves in various body parts, but managed to persevere, uh, at our very, very robust, uh, as a business.", "So summer 2011. Now this is when the dominoes start to tip the other way.", "They make an announcement. So again, we're now a couple of years into this streaming business. It's again, instant product, market fit.", "People love it. It's 20% of the internet. They know this is the future. So up until this point. Everybody who was a Netflix subscriber to the DVD rental business just got the streaming baked into it.", "Like you just subscribed to Netflix. It's just one product. It's like prime. We're just going to throw stuff in to sweeten the off.", "Exactly. Summer 2011 they change the pricing structure or they, they issue a press release and there are a couple of, there are few things in this press release.", "What gets all the attention is they come out, they build this as a price cut.", "It's anything but in reality. Come on. Don't, don't bury the lead like PR role number one. If you're about to announce something that consumers hate, do not make the title bet.", "You're accusing me of burying the lead. No, the lead comes later. Second separate press release. But yes.", "Yeah, no, totally. I'm saying, yeah, that Netflix, that press release hardcore Barry.", "Yeah. This is a gunshot wound. Self-inflicted number one. So what did they do? They changed the pricing.", "Their pricing tiers too, so they now have three options. You can subscribe to just DVD rentals, and they build that as a price cut.", "So cheaper than what just subscribing to Netflix was before. You can subscribe to the greater usage is on the streaming side, right?", "You can subscribe to just streaming. Four also cheaper than the price of the old bundled Netflix plan.", "Or you can have the bundle, you can have both. And that goes up, uh, I think like 20% of price or 20 or 25% or something like that.", "People reacted very negatively to this quote unquote price cut. Um, so negatively, they lose a million subscribers basically, instantly.", "Now they've grown a lot, so it's not like, you know, we're losing a million subscribers back in. Part one was like losing, you know, 20% of their business.", "Um. But still like it's the stock price takes a beating. It's still very significant people. People are very upset.", "My father was one of them, and I don't know if he still listens to the show, but I distinctly remember him like boycotted Netflix for a year or two before he signed back up and it was furious about this.", "Again, this is the recession like. It's just so tone deaf. Like people loved Netflix, like people were losing their jobs and cutting the cord on their cable company, but keeping Netflix because this was like their, you know, their happiness.", "Like it was like one of the most high, whatever the, you know, those brand ratings that they do.", "Netflix was like up there with Apple and Amazon and like the very, very best. Best brands in America, and this just did huge damage.", "People felt betrayed. Their stock plummeted too. I mean, I think Netflix has always sort of been valued on their subscriber growth and actually more recently really on sort of what their projected subscriber growth will be next quarter.", "Um, and this was to, to have a down quarter where they actually lost subscribers. It was like, what, the only time this had happened in the past is what we saw in part one when, when blockbuster launched a total access.", "So what are they going to do. Hastings has a plan. Of course. Now we should know, I forgot to mention earlier, um, at the end of 2010 also something, you know, long time coming foreshadow that we knew happened, but sad for Netflix.", "They're great hero. Barry McCarthy, uh, retires and leaves the company. He decided not to leave his friends in the knife fight against blockbuster, or I'm sorry, against Amazon when they thought that Amazon was coming in.", "And so, uh. Now. Now, now they're safe. So he can leave. He leaves and, uh, he takes some time.", "He becomes an investor with TCV and, um, then does his short stint at Clinkle and then joined Spotify, uh, as, as we talked about in that episode.", "But back to Netflix. So there's no, no, Barry McCarthy Reed, you know, he has a plan to address this issue.", "He thinks that the way to do it is, you know, he knows the future.", "It's the public that doesn't get it. They don't get that streaming is the future. He is going to open their eyes to this.", "He just needs to push harder in that first press release. They about the price. Cut, quote unquote. They got so much negative reaction kind of at the end.", "He said, you know, and this is a precursor to, we are going to spin off the DVD rental as a separate business.", "Eventually he decides that the way to fix all of this is explained that this is really part of the bigger strategy and to do this spin off and execute, executed and show America like the path.", "Forward. So he decides the way he's going to do this. So the plan is that they're spinning off the DVD rental business into Quickster and a longtime Netflix, um, executive who we didn't talk about in the last episode, Andy Rendez, who ran, um, I believe ran all DVD operations.", "He's going to be the CEO now, now of Quickster. Yeah. And he'd been there for like 12 years or something.", "He'd been there for a long, long, long time. How are they going to do this? They're going to do what?", "You know all the hip kids are doing these days. They're gonna make a a video and they're going to post it on YouTube and it'll go viral and everybody will understand, you know, the vision it's going to be, this is like the seven 11 dude at blockbuster coming back and we're like, the kids, they're going to come, they're going to eat pizza.", "The blockbuster stores. It was, it was, it party on the block. Uh, uh, rock the block. Rock the block.", "This is the rock, the block moment for Netflix. They're going to post a viral video on YouTube. Well, they make a video, um, read and, and uh, and Andy, they, they make a video and it does go viral, uh, in September, 2011, uh, winning hashtag winning.", "Um, but it goes viral for the wrong reasons. We will link to this video in the show notes. Still on the Netflix YouTube channel.", "I think this might be the most painful thing I've ever. Yeah, it's still there. So I thought it would be, you know, on YouTube, somebody else, and many people have mirrored it", "It's still on the Netflix account. This is amazing. They're proud. They're proud. Oh my God. This is the one of the most painful videos I've ever watched in my life.", "Imagine the least Lake cool, most fake, like corporate like dad thing you could ever imagine and then multiply by 10 that's this.", "It is a three and a half minute video. The two of them basically like, it's like scripted, so like they're trying to be hip and cool.", "They're like patio furniture outside the Netflix headquarters and Reed is wearing like a, like a teal like shirt", "and he's got his goatee and like most people never seen read in person at this point.", "Listeners, if. If this is ever us and like we are, we become like tone deaf, like, well, maybe we are already, please write us emails.", "Please acquire an fm@gmail.com don't worry if we do something like this, I wouldn't be worried about getting feedback because within like days of this getting posted read on his personal blog, he gets 30,000.", "Comments on his blog. Basically just trashing him for like how bad this is. So Saturday night live, they, it's, so, this goes so viral.", "They parody the video on Saturday night live. They've, uh, Fred Armisen, the, um, uh, you know, the Portlandia guy, he's Andy I think, and I forget who does, uh, does read.", "And it's just like, it's so funny, you know, the stock price got crushed. The first press release this time.", "It gets crushed. Even for Lincoln, Netflix and Quickster basically become the laughing stock of the internet.", "Um, Hey, a lot of their big bets pay off. A lot of them don't, but they take big bets. They take, they take big bets.", "This is when they really should have thought through it a little more. Before the July press release, they were trading at $305 a share.", "After the Quickster announcement, they're down to $65 this year, so they lose Lake. Was that 80% of their value as a company in like a couple of months here.", "And the Quickster thing itself, like part of it is a big part is the way they announced this and how this went down.", "It's also just like, it's half-baked, like this is not a good product. This is not well executed. This is not well thought through.", "So customers. When they announced they spin off and do it. You have to have a separate account on Quickster and Netflix.", "Separate customer service, like separate company, man, what do you expect? Yeah, talk about like a terrible experience.", "And this is, this is like the kicker here. Netflix didn't. Even grab the Quickster Twitter handle. So there was some dude out there who had the Quickster Twitter handle and a fairly, he was like a pot-smoking like soccer player guy.", "And he's like, just start trolling Netflix and his like publicly extorting them and you know, so bad, so bad.", "What is the net of this? What, what all happens within one month. It was September. When they do this, ill advised YouTube video announcing quick stare.", "Within a month, they cancel Quickstart. They completely unwind the whole company.", "Andy, uh, rented, you know, the, the 12 year next Netflix veteran who'd been tapped to CEO, like, he's gone, he resigns, he leaves the company, uh, everybody, you know, like half the people who had gone over to Quickster, they get laid off.", "They're gone. Like, they just completely like, I mean, this is one thing about Netflix and, and, and read is like, they make.", "Big decisions. They make them confidently and um, you know, if they're the wrong thing, then they pull the plug.", "So they pulled the plug on quick stair. Another bad thing for Netflix. Oh, well, bad thing at the time.", "I think good thing in the long term happens for them in 2011. Amazon. They didn't launch the Netflix competitor and the DVD streaming and the DVD rental era.", "They launched the Netflix streaming competitor, Amazon instant video, and they get into the streaming game and then early in 2012 they also do a deal with epics, the joint venture that Netflix had done a deal with spend.", "I think about the same amount of money, about a billion dollars, get all the same content.", "And so now, not only has Netflix just shot themselves, you know, in multiple body parts with this Quickster thing.", "Now they have Amazon out there, which is offering Amazon instant video bundled with prime. If you're a prime subscriber already, like Netflix is like, Oh yeah, you were paying for Netflix.", "Amazon's like, Oh, great. Have it phrase entire company's value prop for free. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Dude.", "Yeah. Sweetens are offering a little bit. Yeah, here you go. So. The net result of this is 2012 is a tough, tough year for Netflix.", "I didn't go back and verify every quarter, but I believe they missed their subscriber targets every quarter of the year.", "Um, the stock price is totally languishing, uh, still around the $60 a share. You know, one thing they do start in 2012, though, that, uh, is a name no one will recognize, but foreshadows everything to come is a Netflix produced their very first show called Lillehammer.", "Um, I don't think it does vary. I mean, I don't never seen it. Um, I've never watched it. Yeah. Yeah.", "But a harbinger of good things to come. Uh, but one more bad thing in 2012 this is, let's go back to the back.", "Let's go back to the bad stuff. Let's keep ripping on Netflix. It'll just make their rise so much better.", "This was another unbelievable thing that, uh. I, I again, I didn't know about the first part in part one", "and I didn't know about the second part here. You cannot make this stuff up. Even if you did a Netflix special, Carl Icahn who comes in to, you know, the stock price is languishing by the end of 2012 who returns but acquired supervillain.", "He's like, Barry McCarthy's gone. Great buy, take another. Go at this one, take another. Go at this one.", "He is back in the movie business. Game. He announces that he has accumulated a 10% equity stake in Netflix on the public markets.", "Uh, I believe this is October, 2012 and, uh, you know, he's going to start getting involved.", "I love how this happens too, like in, in public companies, you can just slowly buy and buy and buy and buy, and then, you know, you don't want to announce that you're buying, so it'll move the stock price and then like, suddenly you just say, Hey guys.", "You may not know this, but through various sources, I have a 10th of your company.", "Yeah. Incredible. You know, he thinks that, that really what Netflix should do, you know, they've been so much service management here, you know, the, uh, but it's, there's so much value in streaming is the future they met, represents strategic value.", "They should sell themselves to a media company or, or to another tech company.", "Do you know if he held, like, is he still a major Netflix shareholder? He held until 2015 and then he announced in 2015 that he had a liquidated his whole stake.", "I believe it was. About halfway through 2015 he made a ton of money, a ton of money. But the only, I guess, good thing for, um, people who dislike, uh, Carl, like, uh, uh, if you're, if you're on the superhero side of the house here, is he misses out on like a ton of gains still.", "And like, he believed in 2015 that like Amazon was gonna crush them and well then that hasn't happened.", "So he missed out on the majority of gains that he could've had. But 2012 despite all this bad stuff that happens, Netflix now, like there, they've really been the only player in this huge new market of streaming for the last, you know, at this point, three plus years.", "They started figuring a couple of things out there that nobody else has figured out yet. Uh, and this is really what, what saves the company.", "They realize that they start to see it, seeing the data for the, how people are streaming. They're doing two things that were not.", "So like when somebody sits down to start streaming, Netflix. They stream for a long time and if they're watching like a TV series or something, they watched it episode after episode and up until this point, the media content industry operated on this assumption.", "I remember this of like appointment viewing, you know, like, you know, people tuned in at 8:00 PM on, you know, Wednesday to watch the latest episode of mad men or whatever.", "And like with linear television, that is still what works. All the top shows on linear TV are still exactly that.", "And actually most of them are alive. It's just all sit around these like standalone, like half an hour or one hour, like get your face and then tune in next week.", "They want to watch the whole thing all at once. And related to that, the other thing that they figure it out is unlike the DVD rental business, the content that really works in streaming is television shows, not films, not, not these self-contained, you know, two to three hour.", "Films, but like really, really long form episodic content that people can binge watch television at this point.", "This, they're kind of like the, you know, the little sibling of the, of the media world. Like it was the big blockbuster movies that everybody wanted to make.", "Yeah. So this brings back an interesting and classic acquired fashion, jumping forward to tech themes.", "Um, and we'll pull it back, but this brings back something that I think we talked about in the Marvel episode that is, there's been a trend, I'm going to get the numbers wrong, but if you look at like in 1985 out of the top 25 movies, the number that were sequels, there was like three.", "And if in 2015 it was the exact opposite, like 22 were either sequels or some form of unoriginal IP. So you have this trend going on where Hollywood is spending more and more money on films.", "So because they're spending $100 million plus on every single production. They're taking less risks. So they want more sort of sure things that are reusing IP, um, from, you know, children's stories or, or, or bringing back movies from the eighties and nineties.", "So the experimentation needs to go somewhere. It's kind of the same thing as like startups, like the, the sort of the lean startup where, where do you sort of prototype whether IP is good or not.", "So it sort of opens up the opportunity for this golden era of, of television or golden era of, of, you know, TV shows that attracts really top notch.", "Both writers, directors, actors, and it really blows the doors wide open for some of the best people in the business who don't want to be part of Aquaman.", "Seven to go and do something creative and original. And Netflix is sort of the place where you could actually facilitate that format.", "Ben, you referenced Lillehammer in in 2012 you know, the one probably in and of itself wasn't that much of a bright spot, but that was what, you know, the sign that Netflix had finally kind of figured this out.", "What they'd learned from their customers was, Hey, we, we need to pump more. You know, episodic series based, quote unquote television content into the streaming platform.", "So they make Lillehammer they released it in 2012 and then in 2013 they do two things. One, they bring back, I remember when this happened, even though I wasn't a fan of the show, but it was just such a big deal.", "They bring back arrested development. Yeah. It was worse but better. Like it was more complex and crazy than the original development.", "But like somehow it just, it didn't quite have the magic, but it was good enough that like you got your fix of, of what you felt like you'd been missing is a good example of giving people what they want, you know, for this new platform.", "And then the other thing they do, they, they debut in early 2013 is their first real big swing at content.", "House of cards, and this was just such a seminal moment. I did some research on this because I remember at the time, I. Binge watched the whole first and second seasons pretty aggressively.", "I remember at the time reading about it and just thinking like, wow, this is so special. This company spent $100 million across these first two seasons.", "And I remember looking it up at the time and I just sort of went back now to double check all of that and see like what a big bet that was.", "So this isn't early 2013 in 2012, the company had $290 million of cash on hand.", "And they had committed 100 million. To creating just this two seasons of this one show. A few more stats on this.", "So like the, even the total current assets, including their entire content library, prepaid content, short term investments, all of that was just over 2 billion.", "Now if you go to today, like they have $3 billion in cash alone, close to $9 billion in total assets, you know, you can sort of see how they're investing so much in content, but like they created a cultural moment.", "Around, Oh my God, Kevin Spacey and this incredibly high production value thing just dropped on Netflix.", "Yeah, well, and it's crazy. Like they, I mean, one, as we've seen time and time and time again with this company, when they swing, they swing hard.", "But this was one, unlike the Quickster debacle, like this was so informed, like of course they couldn't know.", "What was going to happen with house of cards, but it was informed by all the advantages they had.", "So they knew, you know, Kevin Spacey, we've learned a lot more about Kevin Spacey since 2013 but at the time he was this like actor that everybody kind of knew about him, but nobody, he wasn't like a box office draw.", "Like there wasn't, if you had a blockbuster movie coming out, you didn't want to cast it.", "Case in point, you didn't want to cast Kevin's, but you know, he's not Leonardo DiCaprio here. Capex was great.", "Donate it. Maybe there's less of us that that loved it, but it was great. Well, he didn't have mass appeal to the traditional Hollywood movie studios.", "However, Netflix saw that people, cause they had all the data on what people were watching that once people watched a Kevin Spacey streamed the Kevin Spacey movie, they tended to go find all the other movies that.", "He had been watch them and they're like, okay, there's something going on here. And then house of cards had been a British show, uh, that they readapted to the U S and the British show was on Netflix and they were like, man, nobody knows about this thing.", "But like, people love it when people start watching it.", "They get totally hooked. And then they'd been jet. So what do they do when they release house of cards?", "They release, I believe this is the first time this has ever happened. They released all 13 episodes of the season all at once.", "People in the content industry are like, why aren't you doing this? You're completely upending the model.", "Like, you know, you're not gonna like you're gonna miss the ability to draw out this whole thing over a period of time, like completely like huge win for Netflix.", "It was David Fincher too, right? He directed it or wrote it. Yeah, I think something like that. And this one, he was, he was super hot at the time cause he had just done the social network and the girl with the dragon tattoo.", "Yup. That's right. That's right. Huge win with house of cards in early 2013 subscriptions pour in because again, this is the first time there's like this.", "Kayla w water cooler moment. Everybody in America is talking about house of cards and you can get the whole season and binge watch it all at once and people are doing this and like, the only way you can do that is if you subscribe to Netflix.", "So subscriptions pour in, the stock goes back up for the first time, over $200 remember it was $300 before the whole Quickster debacle.", "So they're finally like getting back up, and then they followed their, they realize this is gonna work.", "So then this is the beginning of going all in on this content acquisition and production strategy.", "Later in the year, they do a deal with Marvel before Marvel gets acquired by Disney to create episodic TV content around Marvel superheroes.", "This is like Daredevil and, um, was it Luke cage and all the stuff you see on Netflix, uh, this is where all this comes from.", "In 2014, they realize, man, we've got this, like this, this flywheel effect here, where the more.", "Great original content that we have original and exclusive content that leads to more subscribers. The more subscribers we get, the more financial ability we have to invest in original and acquired exclusive content.", "How can we start accelerating this flywheel even more. We can do this with the debt capital like this is we've a very predictable subscription based business.", "If we can forecast our subscriber growth accurately, and Ben, you alluded to this about subscriber growth becoming the big thing for Netflix.", "We should be able to raise debt ahead of this and use that debt to invest in content, which we will know will drive subscriptions.", "So 2014 they basically changed their whole capital market strategy.", "They'd been. You know, like most tech companies at this point, no debt, completely equity financed and cashflow positive.", "They start raising debt and investing it into content to the point where now today they have over $8 billion in debt.", "And for folks that sort of don't deal in the equity versus debt world, this is the perfect thing to take debt for us, a company like it because it's non-dilutive capital, so nobody's equity is getting pushed down.", "The people who are issuing you debt are very happy to give it because you can provide them. Incredibly high certainty about what your ability to repeatedly sort of generate cash on cash returns from you investing that that again, the magic of subscription based businesses that we've talked about on inquired, like, you know what?", "Your revenues and cash flows are going to be. Yeah. And to like way over simplify it. I mean, if you know that you have a 10% interest rate on that debt, but you know that by spending that to accelerate your flywheel, you can get 20% per year.", "It's like, how much debt can we have? You know? So they start slowly.", "They do a, I believe, a $400 million bond deal in, uh, 2014. And then they start getting bigger and bigger to the point where their most recent bond deal that I think they did this month in October, 2018 was $2 billion in, and they have 8 billion in total debt outstanding.", "You know, which is a huge amount for a tech company.", "But, but again, based on the cashflow dynamics and the subscription dynamics of this business, as long as they are for.", "Can accurately forecast subscriber growth. Yeah, it can work. I mean, unless there's some, if there's some competitive thing, I mean, as we saw with Tesla, like if there's something that materially changes David, to go back to your thing from the, uh, the LP show, the going sideways and sort of explaining what that is, when you rack up a lot of debt with a belief that you're going to have very predictable cash flows, and then there's something structural that changes in the industry, that's when you can open yourself up to a world of hurt.", "So that's sort of the only reason why you wouldn't want to just keep stacking it. The danger of, uh, of debt.", "So far, though, it's worked really, really well. So, you know, to wrap things up and get us, get us to today, um, summer of 2014 as they're investing heavily into this strategy, they passed 50 million global subscribers, uh, 36 million in the U S 14 million internationally.", "Then in, in 2016 in January, they make a big announcement at CES, uh, that they are launching. Worldwide in 150 countries, I believe literally every country except mainland China, uh, North Korea and one or two others, um, Crimea, Crimea, and Syria.", "And of course, it's all, you know, English-based they haven't actually translated Netflix into all these languages yet, although they, they start that project and now I believe they have translated into many of these languages.", "The past 75 million subscribers globally during the year in 2016, they released 126 original. Films and TV shows series more than any other content company out there, period.", "Any other cable channel or, or, or network. Now actually, I don't know if that includes like the, I believe it's less than the big conglomerates like Disney as a whole or Viacom as a whole.", "Um, but if any one like division, like Netflix is the largest single content production company. And then the irony of ironies is.", "In 2016 they actually do finally successfully execute the spin off with Quickster. They just don't call it Quickster dvd.com", "if you go to dvd.com that is the DVD rental business for Netflix, so you can no longer subscribe to the online DVD rental.", "Uh, via Netflix, you now have to go to this separate company, separate login, dvd.com. But is it a separate company like it's different shareholders?", "Uh, it is a, it is a dvd.com quote, a Netflix company. So I believe it is 100% owned by Netflix and it a wholly owned subsidiary and it has something like, they do like 120 million in revenue a year and like 60 million.", "Profit or like, you know, cashflow. So nice, you know, classic growth stock, right? Value, stock, value stock, um, and,", "and, you know, things just keep going from there. So this year in 2018, they passed $100 billion market cap.", "There've been several stock splits, uh, over the last few years. So the stock prices isn't quite the same, but.", "Now, you know, in October, 2018, um, you know, they just announced earnings and they now have just under 60 million us subscribers.", "So if you go on a household basis, uh, assume there are a hundred ish million us households, that's 60% of the U S market, larger than any cable company in America, Comcast, time Warner, you know.", "Uh, what have you, charter in 137 million subscribers worldwide, uh, which is just incredible. If you look at that sort of third quarter announcement and sort of play forward what it's going to be by the end of the year, they're going to do close to $15 billion in revenue this year and over a billion in net income or profit.", "And I think this will be their first year that they, that they do $1 billion in net net income. Yeah.", "One of my other favorite stats on catching us up to today. In the first half of 2018, the stock doubled.", "So I think that was something like $70 billion of market cap were created. Like $70 billion market cap companies don't double in six months.", "Not that a stock prices necessarily. Exactly. Value creation, but um, yeah, pretty. It's pretty impressive.", "One, this is, you know, maybe something to get into here in, in tech themes that. It's probably the right moment to transition into it.", "You know, for years, people have been talking about the Fang stocks and, and loving Netflix in with, um, it with Facebook, with Amazon, with Google.", "Uh, but Netflix is actually much for, for most of the last few years, and even today, much, much smaller than those companies.", "And, you know, I think that's how you can get such a, you know, a doubling in market cap is, you know, they're only quote unquote, I think about $130 billion.", "Market cap company, you know, compare that to the, you know, 500 million, a billion to trillion dollar market caps of the other Fang companies.", "Another interesting data point about them being smaller. I was surprised to learn they only had 5,500 employees where if you look at someone like an Amazon who has, you know, eight X the market cap, but they have a hundred X, the employees compared to the other Fang stocks, they have remarkably few employees for their valuation.", "Cause you look at Microsoft that has 130 Amazon has over 600,000 Apple is 132,000 including retail. You know, even Facebook's over 30,000 Google at 85 I mean there's, there's no one that's down in this sort of like sub 10,000 employee category.", "I sort of wonder two things. One, is it because their product offering is so simple that most of the sort of product and engineering work that you would typically have big teams on it as is a lot of sort of infrastructure and that they've really paired down the product line to be pretty streamlined.", "But I also wonder. A lot of these people that are working on these productions, I mean those aren't employees.", "You sort of staff up those productions and staff. I'm down on sort of a contract basis, or are we like ankles deep into a, into the water of tech themes.", "I mean, at this point, we're two and a half hours into history of Netflix. I think we can get into tech.", "There was a great tweet awhile ago. It was from one of John Gruber's, like three and a half hour podcasts on the talk show that was like, I can't remember the last time, I wasn't listening to the talk show.", "It's like we hope to not quite get there, but we do actually have a pretty good meaty tech themes part.", "Cause I think whereas the last episode was really more narrative. This one, there's a lot of good analysis to be done on on Netflix, and so I'll start with some of the more sort of like.", "Uh, things that are interesting to point out, but not crazy analytical.", "So one of them is, there's a great business insider page, and we'll, we'll link to this in the show notes that shows the evolution of the homepage over the years.", "I was thinking about it, it seems very obvious to go to Netflix now and just start watching. Like that's what you do.", "But they had to do a ton of education over the years, both on the sort of innovative DVD model. Um, and then on this crazy idea that you could stream movies over the internet on your computer.", "And for many years they're in the awkward middle. The, the homepage was like this cluttered mess to explain how to do all this.", "So there was like one half of, it was like one, two, three. Like we will mail you a DVD, you will watch it, you will put it in this envelope, you will mail it back.", "And these like infographics of how to do that because that, that was confusing. And then on top it was like, or.", "Instant, like click here, then download Silverlight.", "And there's this big hairy explanation to consumers to tell people what they did. And today you go to netflix.com you don't have any options.", "Like they've done a tremendous job, number one, doing what they needed to do to be sort of really messy, to educate people on what are these paradigms that we're basing our company around.", "But then also once they've sort of hit critical mass and this this tipping point where now they can be incredibly simple.", "And there's a bunch of stuff that they've cut over time that has been really like, it's crazy. Looking at the Netflix today and thinking about the Netflix that that was.", "So the things that they've done that have been less over time.", "You know, DVDs are this subsidiary. They spun out this at top box. They said no to vending machines. They deprecate it.", "A lot of these things that were brands, so like search on their site used to be flexed finder and their algorithm used to be cinematic and they like they were, it was all about having all these like branded things that they were telling you about themselves.", "They in 2013 or something, launched this very advanced social feature where you would connect your Facebook and then it would make recommendations.", "Based on things that your friends liked. They've completely cut that. And the only thing you can do with Facebook anymore is login with Facebook.", "I mean, it really reminds me of the time, the, the Steve jobs coming back to Apple and pointing out the product matrix and saying like, we're getting rid of three quarters of this.", "Netflix never really changed leaderships, but sort of spiritually, they had this moment where. The public now knew what they did, and they could sort of drop all of the posturing and all of the education and just be, we deliver this thing that has an incredible value prop and perfect product market fit, and that's all we do.", "The one that that just sparked was, um, we didn't really talk about Amazon, uh, and, and the history and facts other than mentioned that, you know, they launched a, what instant video that became prime video.", "I think all that, that really did. Everybody was so terrified of it. Uh, and in 2012, that was part of why it was such a bad year for Netflix and the stock price.", "In a market that is growing so big and growing so fast as streaming, like the streaming market is, is displacing the cable.", "All the video content consumption, uh, you know, in America that is a way bigger market than the DVD rental business.", "So like in a smaller market, like still very large, yet smaller market, like the DVD rental business, blockbuster and Netflix fighting it out, like eventually became like a, a, you know, a fight to the death.", "But. Still, even though these companies are so big, Amazon video, Amazon's video division and Netflix, like the market is so big, they are just helping one another.", "Amazon launching even like an essentially free version of Netflix is just helping Netflix grow right now I think.", "And likewise, Netflix is just helping Amazon video grow because they're each adding like their own exclusive content.", "Uh, and, and people are like, well, you know, I really wanna like, I want to watch men in the high castle and I want to watch house of cards.", "So like, I'm just going to subscribe to both and like, they're educating the market, you know, both ways.", "So interesting to think about myself in that situation. Like I'm subscribed to Netflix because that's where I go to watch stuff.", "I'm subscribed to Amazon because of course I'm gonna subscribe to prime, other than like, the, the exclusives, I really just haven't gone there to watch stuff.", "And I don't know, I think lots of our listeners probably are like, I watch all my stuff there. But for whatever reason, like Netflix is the default for me, and it's only when I hit the wall.", "If I can't find anything, do I go over to Amazon? I'm not sure I would pay for Amazon if it wasn't bundled into my prime subscription.", "Well, it'll be interesting to see. I mean, we're going to hit, people have been forecasting this, but it hasn't seemed to happen yet.", "Hit subscription fatigue where it's like, look, I'm not going to do my HBO now and Netflix and Amazon and Disney.", "Effing plus, um, like I, you know, I think we'll have to see, uh, we'll have to see where that lands and see what people's comfort number is.", "But it's interesting, like to this point, like it hasn't, I don't think any of these companies, I've heard of one another.", "Amazon is definitely behind in subscribers. I think the, in the same research report that said that Amazon, that Netflix was 15% of internet traffic, the amount that you can attribute to a.", "Prime video I think is like, or Amazon video at all. It's like less than a third of that. Interesting.", "The, the other quick tech theme that we talk about all the time on this show, um, but that this, uh, highlighted for me, uh, which Dan Hill on the latest LP episode talked about.", "If you make something that people love, it can kind of overcome all sins, right?", "Like Netflix kept screwing up so many times about the, you know, product wise, all the stuff you were just talking about, like the whole Quickster thing.", "But like at the end of the day, like. People loved the fact that they could, you know, binge watch all 13 episodes of house of cards.", "Of course, they're going to tell their friends and if you can make something that people love, that they will tell their friends about, like that is a recipe for success.", "You know, despite many other failures along the way. All right, drifting toward business model. The magic of zero distribution costs and particularly when you don't have a rev share in place, is, you know, worth talking about here where this is, you know, if you compare Netflix to like a Spotify, for example, Netflix licenses all of this content upfront or creates it so they don't even have any licensing fee.", "They just sort of create it and take all the risk, um, or spend to create all that risk. So then all the marginal revenue goes to them, but you know, they, they have.", "High capital costs, high operational costs, very high fixed cost to create this content, but like little, little marginal cost.", "So then the game for them becomes like, okay, how much can we blow it out?", "Uh, once we have this thing, how can we get the maximum utilization out of that asset? This. Kind of dives into two points that, uh, Ben Thompson of Stratec or he talks about these and they're fantastic points.", "And I'd say he talks about them so often and makes them so well that we would be remiss not to sort of credit him with this thinking when we talk about it.", "You know, now that Netflix has this huge subscriber base as a sort of mentioned, how big can we blow it out?", "They can dump 100 million into things like house of cards without batting an eyelash. Since the cost of producing a show is spread across a massive amount of subscribers.", "So there's. Strategy to produce a broad set of shows for a broad audience is the winning strategy in this market.", "And compare that against what HBO was thinking a few years ago, and some others have done this too, of we want to produce amazingly well produced content that really hits home for a narrow audience.", "You just can't amortize the cost of that across nearly as many people. And so. Over time. Like you just can't afford to spend to create the best content cause you just don't have as many people to deliver it to.", "You know, you can find yourself between a rock and a hard place if you're not thinking about the same thing that Netflix is thinking about, which is more subscribers to sort of reduce the per person cost of producing expensive content.", "For sure. That is a winning strategy. They've also done both right lower, like there's a tons of niche, like Netflix produced niche content on Netflix.", "Uh, they just don't spend that much money on, like, I feel like they're really good analytically at understanding like what is the ROI in terms of, uh, either new subscriber growth or subscriber retention that we're going to get for this piece of content.", "And for something like house of cards that's going to be so broad based in reach, like.", "They can spend $100 million for something like a documentary on. Um, uh, there's actually a pretty good league documentary on, um, like the roots of hip hop on a Netflix that I watched on a plane once and like, you know, great, lots of people should watch it, right?", "You know, like they did the math on how much they could invest in that. There's also a pretty bad documentary on Vince Carter called the Carter effect.", "They make all kinds of, might've watch that late one night. Oh, well, okay. So I'll throw out a little counter argument to that.", "So the thing that drives new subscriber growth for them is hit shows.", "So when they have a corridor that tons and tons and tons of people come and sign up for Netflix, it's because they have an orange is the new black that draws in all the people.", "You know, Netflix is strategy has, has been to stay away from sports and live and things like that, that are not evergreen content.", "Even though they, they want to create evergreen content and they amass this really rich catalog. There is a little devil in the details that is, people that sign up that quarter are probably signing up because they have this new hit piece of content that, that everybody's coming for.", "And so, uh, I think your point still stands that they'll spend a bunch of money on the big splashy thing", "and then they'll just spend a little bit of money producing sort of the long tail of niche based stuff to make sure they satisfy all the different niches on their, their platform.", "But I felt it would be a failure not to point that out. Okay. I have another one that I've been like almost talking about that I wanna.", "I wanna actually hit, and this is another good Stratec worry thing. So Netflix has flywheel, so they focus on this content that's relatively evergreen, staying away from live.", "So the more capital that they amass, either through debt or equity or earnings, the more content they can license or produce.", "Which then makes the product better for users. So more users come to pay and then kind of feeds back into that cycle of the more capital they IMS.", "So then theoretically. They have this thing going on where the product actually gets better because the catalog gets richer.", "So either they can charge more money over a time, or they can keep their prices the same and reduce marketing costs to reach people that would have been reticent to pay for a worst product.", "But now that the product is amazing because it has all this content, we can actually start to like really saturate the far edges while keeping the price point the same for people that previously wouldn't have wanted it that bad.", "A lot of things about how they've structurally set up the business, enable them to create this virtuous cycle and succeed more as they scale instead of less as they scale.", "Because I think for a lot of businesses like cost of acquiring a customer goes up over time because you've already hit all your best customers and gotten them, and then you have to spend more, but they just have this amazing characteristic where the product gets better.", "It's funny, I hadn't quite thought about this, but it's a little bit like. Uber, right? Like there, there are a few of these businesses out there that are truly special, where you actually have a period in your growth curve where your customer acquisition cost goes down a now, and I don't know, I haven't done the analysis or math to know if this, uh, what you're saying is true about Netflix, but I, but it makes sense at least, uh, intellectually, like Uber got to a point, I believe it's now.", "Probably their incremental cost of customer acquisition at this point is probably going up. But there was a point where it went down massively because the service improved so much with density and ubiquity of adoption.", "Um, I think it's a tipping point. Like if you think about Uber, it's like it needs to get sufficiently good so that there's a ride within three minutes", "and then I kind of don't care how many drivers are on the platform after that.", "But Netflix may not have this. Sort of point of inversion where it's like literally always more content is better.", "Interesting. Yeah. But there's probably diminishing returns on that too. Actually. That's a pretty interesting framework to think about.", "A marketplace or aggregator or platform businesses.", "When is it that they don't have that good enough? Sort of like a point where the more you operate, the more valuable you get indefinitely instead of with diminishing returns.", "One more point to make here, which is kind of just an interesting thing to know about the company. Over the last three years, Netflix has grown as subscriber base.", "By 30% year over year, give or take like 1% basically every year they're, they're growing 30% interestingly, they're, they're basically the, the company is extremely data-driven about when to do marketing spend and sort of when they feel it's a good idea to go and spend on customers.", "So I think a lot of this stuff we're, we're sort of talking about is, is true in the abstract, like the product getting more valuable over time.", "A new big hits drawing people in. But Netflix, based on their earnings reports, appears to care about growing 30% year over the year and then flexing different levers to get there.", "So sometimes they spend more money on content, which for other companies you to sort of think about as product investment.", "And sometimes they. Yeah. And sometimes they spend more money on marketing. And I think it's probably, I would imagine the way that it kind of works is like when they feel like they have an opportunity to create a superstar show, they go hard into it.", "If it works and they're going to hit their 30% growth and they don't need to do an enormous amount of marketing spend.", "If it doesn't, then they need to do more marketing spend to bring people onto the platform. Um, it's just kind of an interesting way to think about driving the business.", "And since that's. Been so constant. It's sort of clear, uh, what levers they're moving to accomplish what end.", "I'm so glad we took like all of this time to dive into Netflix.", "Like I at least did not understand this company. Or its history at all before diving in here, despite how nominally ubiquitous it is in Silicon Valley.", "One last thing I also assumed before really like diving in and looking at market caps, that they were much bigger than they are because people talk about them in as a thing stock and like what are the things, stocks.", "Those is great. Yet another thing we'll link to in the show notes, a great tweet today by a Benedict Evans at Andreessen Horowitz with a graph showing on the X axis.", "Revenue on the Y axis, revenue growth, and sort of plotting all these companies like Apple, Amazon, Google, Facebook.", "They're sort of understandably at least way far to the right in terms of total revenue and also growing pretty quickly.", "Netflix is like way smaller in terms of revenue then than these other companies. And also not like they have less growth, revenue growth and Facebook does less than Amazon does.", "Like we talk about them like they're, this. You know they're one of those five, but it's kind of arbitrary and that's the, that's the point at Ben is making thinking again, if I were to put my old media TMT investment banker hat back on, I think maybe the justification with that is that is is back to just the, like the stability and predictability of subscription based businesses.", "Like the thing about Netflix is like. They know, you know, they know what their revenues going to be to the extent that they understand their churn rates and their gross subscriber ads turn.", "And then best net subscriber, you know, growth or losses a well and can forecast that accurately. Like that is an incredibly stable and predictable business.", "And that has value in terms of valuation versus like a, you know, an Amazon, well, prime is a part of it, but like you're just buying stuff on Amazon.", "Like you may buy more, you may buy less. So, you know, like, or you know, Facebook advertisers may advertise more or may advertise less.", "Same for Google, or Apple may create a hit product, may not.", "You know, there's just a more inherent unpredictability there. Yeah. It still feels arbitrary. Sure. Well, that's why we're no longer investment bankers.", "Is there something worth greening in here. So we talked about grading the spinoff of the DVD business just to have something degrade.", "I mean like, it's really like, what if they didn't. Yeah. What if they didn't? I mean, of course it was the right thing to do.", "The future was streaming the DVD rental business online DVD rental business was going to go the way of the offline DVD rental business of blockbuster.", "Like that market is, it still exists, but was shrinking.", "Of course, they had to transition the company. They just executed it terribly the first time and then executed it the right way the second time where they just didn't talk about it.", "I would say like, um, a for strategy F for execution, like F minus for execution. But, uh, I dunno, what's, what's your take?", "The only thing that I have on sort of execution is like, do you group timing into execution? Because I think they couldn't.", "They couldn't have done it quietly when they did it. And the question is, should they have done it a different way at the time?", "Probably. But how much better could you have done it, or, you know, was it, was it pressing?", "Did it need to be done then, or could it wait three years? Yeah, no, there was no reason to do it then other than Reed Hastings feeling like he, you know, wanted to be, you know, push America and, and the public into his vision of the future, which was correct.", "It was just, you know, he's just sort of waited a couple of years.", "Which gets into, I know we're past tech themes, but like Steve jobs and Apple do this all the time and they take shit for it", "and then it's fine. Like they pulled the floppy drive out of the iMac and they pulled the headphone Jack off the phone and like, you know, you could argue that was a little too early, but.", "Apple usually gets these things right though. Like when they pulled the headphone Jack, like they released AirPods, you know, it's like, here's a better alternative.", "The thing is when, when the Quickster when they did Quickster streaming wasn't better. Yeah, it was better on some dimensions, but a lot of the content wasn't available, you know?", "And so like, it wasn't quite there that it was just . Obviously better on all dimensions to go to the new thing in Apple toes.", "This line for sure, but like, but they present you with the, like here, if you buy this, if you buy the AirPods they're amazing.", "They're way better. Yeah, that's good point. Carve outs, carve outs mine real quick.", "I believe on the Zappos episode with Alford Lin, uh, we did a carve out of Justin O. Burns, um, Google versus Apple maps.", "Uh, deep analysis. You remembering what carve outs were on what episodes? Yeah, man, we go deep sea level.", "Uh, he did an awesome follow up this month, um, on the new Apple maps. And is it, uh, is it now better than Google maps?", "Spoiler alert.

It lowers Netflix’s customer retention cost.", "Of course Ben Thompson was not really talking about accounting, but he was making a great point about the inadequacy of conventional accounting techniques for many of the current tech giants (for more on this subject read Harvard Business Review’s articles here and here).", "This is why I think Netflix would be better to present its numbers with a more aggressive amortisation of content cost.", "It would not affect the share price and would reassure cynics like us that they weren’t trying to be cute with their accounting.", "We are comfortable with our arithmetic and readers can easily replicate our calculations, but we are confused about motive.", "Usually, companies have a reason for accounting gymnastics and that appears to be missing here.", "But lets say that we are correct and that Netflix is being aggressive in its content accounting and that its accounts should reflect a much higher amortisation if its policy were being correctly implemented.", "Indeed, as we mentioned at the start of this article, looking back at its accounting for DVD purchases, we believe that Netflix has been aggressive in its accounting for some time.", "If we are correct, then there is a more important issue, and that is one of trust. Netflix tried to represent itself as more profitable and more cash generative than reality in the DVD era.", "What if that continued today? That would be puzzling but it could undermine investor faith.

But what gives the show its “oomph,” what I think is at the heart of its allure, is the moment during each episode where we all look at each other and say, “Gee, did that really happen?”", "For the most part, these are characters who are still alive, if extremely crusty, and who have certainly been major public figures my whole adult life.", "And so that does create an inherent fascination even when the stakes are nearly invisible to the naked eye.", "Every second little Prince Charles appears on screen is ripe with agony knowing the life of misery that awaits him on the road to becoming one of the world’s most sad-sack public figures and still not even being king when he turns 70 years old.", "But mostly, it’s re-discovering things that happened decades ago, but took place before most of us were born and so were long forgotten in the mists of time as the image of Queen Elizabeth congealed into that completely unremarkable human who waves and wears those obligatory funny British hats the country forces women of certain economic rank to wear.", "And despite that, the show indeed manages to make many of them, if not epically important to the tides of history, utterly interesting because these things may have actually occurred in the real world.", "Intriguing, but also problematic if you’re writing this show.

Fans don’t want to just be transported by a fictionalized account of royalty.", "They want to know that events unfolded as they appear on the screen, otherwise, the story loses a fair bit of emotional punch.", "Take the Season 2 episode where the Kennedys visit Buckingham Palace.

This does a disservice to the thousands of women who rely on Essure for their reproductive health, as it may encourage them to pursue risky and unnecessary surgery to remove the device.", "Notably, the film's only reference to scientific data regarding Essure is the 2018 Bouillon study published in the Journal of the American Medical Association (\"JAMA\"), which its producers cite out of context and portray in its least favorable light.", "Taken as a whole, the study actually undermines the central premise of the film's representation of Essure.", "The independently funded research compared women with Essure to those who had tubal ligation surgery, the only other method of permanent birth control, and found that many of the concerns described in the film with regard to Essure -- pain (analgesic use) and hysterectomy -- were lower in Essure patients than in tubal ligation patients at both one and three years post procedure.", "The authors of the study concluded: \"These findings do not support increased medical risks associated with hysteroscopic sterilization [e.g., Essure].\"", "The decision by the filmmakers to exclude highly relevant conclusions from a study they cited, apparently because they conflict with their desired narrative, do raise serious concerns about the objectivity and accuracy of the movie.", "The totality of scientific evidence, which was not discussed in the film, includes 40 published studies involving approximately 200,000 women over two decades, and demonstrates the safety and efficacy of Essure, which has remained consistent over time.", "The FDA also has not changed its conclusion that Essure's benefits outweigh any potential risks.", "Most of the movie's focus on Essure is told not through science, but rather through the stories of women who reported concerns about the device.", "Bayer takes any concerns regarding its medicines and devices seriously. Still, it is notable that not a single woman who is satisfied with Essure is included in the film.", "This omission is important because in the Phase II and Pivotal trials at follow up time points of three, six, 12, 18, 24, 36, 48, and 60 months, at least 99% of women were reported to have rated comfort of wearing the Essure inserts as \"good\" or \"excellent.\"", "In the Pivotal trial, at least 97% of women were reported to be \"somewhat\" to \"very satisfied\" at all visits through five years.", "This is summarized in FDA's executive summary prepared in advance of the 2015 Advisory Committee.", "No discussion of the movie and Essure should ignore the issue of removal, which most women featured in the film discuss.", "The film provides no balance on this important topic.

And a disclaimer: Yes, we know “Marco Polo” is a fictionalized dramatization of historical events and does not follow historical records to the letter.", "Ahmad, the chief antagonist of “Marco Polo” season 2 on Netflix, is a great, layered character.", "At the end of season 1, it was revealed that Ahmad, played by Mahesh Jadu, has been plotting to take down Kublai Khan for a long time, even as he sat beside the Great Khan in his court at Karakorum.", "During season 2 he made his big move against Kublai, helping coordinate rebellions both from within the Empire and outside it, fomenting an uprising amongst the remnants of the Song Dynasty and setting up an alliance between Kaidu and Crusaders from the West — and pulling a coup independent of all that.", "It was quite a plan, but ultimately failed — as season 2 closed, Ahmad could be found hanging at the gate of Karakorum.", "Ahmad did what he did in a bid for revenge — the Mongols sacked his hometown when he was a boy, and Ahmad himself was very fortunate to even survive and thrive under the care of Kublai and Empress Chabi.", "Like all things on “Marco Polo,” Ahmad’s story is rooted in history, though the idea that he hated Kublai and wanted to destroy everything he’d built isn’t really supported by the facts.", "Still, history does treat Ahmad Fanakati as a villainous character. Here’s what we know about him.", "Ahmad was from Fanakat (thus the name), a long-since-destroyed town in present-day Uzbekistan. Fanakat is thought to have been destroyed when the Mongols invaded the area in the mid-13th century, though it was rebuilt in the late 14th century and given the new name Shahrukhiya.", "His activities until adulthood are unclear, but at some point he became a member of the court under the Mongol Empress Jamui.", "By the mid-1260s he had become an important financial figure in the empire, thanks to his relationship with Empress Chabi.", "In 1270, he took charge of the finances of the entire Empire under a newly formed financial administration, the Shengshu Sheng.", "Ahmad then built a completely new financial system for the Mongol Empire, one that was considered very harsh by the Empire’s non-Mongol subjects.", "So Ahmad became a hated figure — but being positioned so highly made him untouchable.", "Ahmad was ambitious, and used his power to have his say in other facets of the government, including placing his own people (friends and Han Chinese allies) in high positions as well.", "Over the next decade or so Ahmad managed to really piss off a bunch of other highly placed Mongol officials — including Prince Zhenjin (called Jingim on “Marco Polo”).", "After Empress Chabi died in 1281, Ahmad’s fortunes took a turn for the worse as his chief patron was no longer there to protect him.", "“The Travels of Marco Polo” provides an account of Ahmad’s career and assassination. Polo describes Ahmad as corrupt and oppressive, as well as an embezzler.", "He says that after Ahmad’s death, Kublai ordered all Ahmad’s riches transferred to the treasury, stockpile that was shockingly large.", "Polo attributed Ahmad’s assassination to Chinese military commanders Chenchu and Vanchu, whom he said were hoping to use Ahmad’s death to spark a larger rebellion against the Mongol occupation of China.", "In a nice nod to this account on the show, it was Chinese character Mei Lin, formerly of the Song, who landed the killing blow against Ahmad.", "But these portrayals may not be all that accurate — history, after all, seems to have largely been written by the Chinese, who hated him.", "Plus, that Ahmad held real power in the Empire despite not being Mongol didn’t do him any favors. In any case, the “Jami’ al-tawarikh,” a historical record compiled by the Persian historian Rasha-al-Din Hamadani in the early 14th century, paints Ahmad as an innovative mind whose totally revamped financial system is credited with facilitating the Mongolian Empire’s success in southern China.", "So as far as we know, Ahmad Fanakati was not a schemer plotting the downfall of Kublai Khan, but instead just a bureaucrat — maybe a corrupt one, though almost certainly a layered character regardless.", "Which is still fun, just not as dramatic as the depiction we saw in season 2 of “Marco Polo.”"]}

The 120-mile canal, a commercial shipping hub connecting the Mediterranean and Red Seas, was crucial to English economic interests, particularly since it facilitated the all-important flow of oil.", "Originally opened in 1869, it had been jointly controlled by Britain and France—even after Egypt gained independence in 1922.", "The British were loathe to lose it, and the international influence it signaled.", "While it initially appeared that French and British forces joined the Israelis two days after their incursion, it was later revealed that the three powers had met and planned the attack altogether.", "This crisis put a significant strain on the relationship between these three countries and the United States.", "President Dwight D. Eisenhower was upset with the British, in particular, for not keeping the U.S. informed about their intentions.", "The U.S. threatened all three nations with economic sanctions if they persisted in their attack, and the United Nations passed a resolution calling for a cease-fire.", "The threats worked. The British and French forces withdrew by December; with Israel finally bowing to U.S. pressure in March 1957.", "This crisis was not only seen as a complete failure, one that weakened the influence of Britain and France worldwide, but it was also a turning point in the career of Conservative Prime Minister Anthony Eden, who resigned two months later.", "While his official reason was “ill health,” it has long been assumed the worldwide humiliation he suffered due to his mishandling of the Suez Crisis was the real impetus behind his decision.", "In season two of The Crown, the Queen makes her displeasure with Prime Minister Eden quite clear. But did Queen Elizabeth really disapprove of the prime minister’s handling of the crisis?", "The communication between prime ministers and monarchs are kept secret, but in Victor Rothwell’s book, “Anthony Eden: A Political Biography,” Eden is quoted as saying that he “would not claim she [the queen] was pro-Suez.”", "Lord Altrincham, later known as John Grigg when he disclaimed his title in 1963, was a writer and British politician.", "He jumped into the spotlight in August 1957 when he published a scathing article in his own paper, National and English Review, of Queen Elizabeth II.", "He specifically criticized her public persona and voice, calling her style of speaking “a pain in the neck” and saying she came off as “a priggish schoolgirl.”", "Some of his critiques of her were steeped in sexism, and reminiscent of the criticism many women leaders face today, but they also reflected a growing sentiment amongst British citizens: The monarch was stuck in the past.", "The world around the royal family was changing, and it was time for them to catch up.", "Did Altrincham actually get punched in the face? Yes, except it was a slap. The incident occurred when Altrincham was leaving a television interview.", "It was 64-year-old Philip Kinghorn Burbidge, an ex-soldier and member of the League of Empire Loyalists, who jumped forward to “defend the Queen.”", "He was fined 1 pound and told the court, “Due to the scurrilous attack by Lord Altrincham, I felt it was up to decent Britons to show some resentment.”", "We may never know if Altrincham actually had a private meeting with the Queen herself, as shown in The Crown, since her communications are mostly kept private.", "But we do know two of his recommendations for the Queen were implemented later that year. First, the Queen televised her yearly Christmas message for the first time ever.", "While the address was a tradition that was started by George V in 1932, the people never had a view into the Queen’s home before.", "This served to “humanize” the Queen and provide the public with a glimpse into her family environs. Secondly, the debutante balls normally reserved for Britain’s upper class were made into “garden parties” which included a much larger invitee list spanning many classes.", "Did Altrincham have a lasting effect on the monarchy? In the book, “Monarch: The Life and Reign of Elizabeth II,” author Robert Lacey states, “Thirty years later, in the course of a political meeting at Eton, Charteris (one of the Queen’s private secretaries) told Altrincham, ‘You did great service to the monarchy and I’m glad to say so publicly.’ ”", "Edward VIII became King of England after the death of his father, George V. He ruled for less than a year, abdicating the throne in 1936 in order to marry Wallis Simpson, an American divorcée.", "At the time, the Church of the England—which is led by the monarch—did not allow divorces. Therefore, King Edward VIII had a choice: love or the crown?", "He chose love, taking on the title of Duke of Windsor.", "The relationship between the Duke of Windsor and his royal family has been at the center of many plot lines in The Crown.", "What might have seemed like petty family feuds and a complicated love story, however, is actually much more pernicious, filled with pro-Nazi sympathies and ties to Hitler.", "In October 1937, the Duke and Duchess of Windsor visited Hitler at Berchtesgaden, where Hitler had been vacationing since the 1920s.", "According to biographer Frances Donaldson, in her book “Edward VIII”, the Duke gave Hitler full Nazi salutes during his visit.", "While some say this trip was more to receive support for Edward and his wife, the Duke’s actions speak louder than hypotheses.", "Just after the war, American diplomats uncovered 400 tons of German diplomatic papers, at Marburg Castle.", "Named the Marburg files, they included a cache of documents damaging to the royal family called the “Windsor File”—some 60 documents (letters, telegrams and other papers) written by people working around the Duke, including German agents, during the war.", "Among these documents are details of the Nazis-devised plan “Operation Willi,” where the Germans would gain control of Britain and overthrow the monarchy, returning the Duke to the throne.", "The Germans viewed the Duke, who was perceived to be ambivalent about the war, as a better ally than his successor King George VI.", "In order to get the Duke on their side, German agents tried to manipulate the ostracized royal, even attempting to convince the Duke that his brother, King George, had plans to assassinate him.", "The documents were leaked to the British government, which tried to suppress them.", "When WWII started, the Duke was made a major-general in France; but Winston Churchill, aware of Edward’s pro-Nazi sentiments, sent him to be the governor of the Bahamas.", "But the Duke and Duchess of Windsor did not comply right away, instead spending time in Lisbon and Madrid—during which time the Nazis devised “Operation Willi.”", "In the end, the Duke ended up in the Bahamas and the Nazis never succeeded in overthrowing the crown.", "In 1946, Britain, France and the United States agreed to work together to process the Marburg files, appointing top historians from each country to oversee the project.", "Despite British efforts to continue to hide the truth, Americans released the documents in 1957.", "The Controversy of Prince Philip (Episode 9: Paterfamilias)", "Much of season two of The Crown dives into the personal life of Prince Philip, examining his past and present demons.", "Shown as a cheating, partying womanizer, Philip in real life was linked to numerous women—including two dancers—but neither the Prince nor the women have ever confirmed their relations.", "The controversy swirling around the Prince doesn’t stop there. When Philip was just 18 months old, his family fled Greece after the monarchy toppled.", "In 1930, when he was 9 years old and away at Cheam School in Britain, his mother suffered a nervous breakdown, all his sisters married within 6 months of each other (two marrying high-ranking Nazi officials) and his father ran away to Monaco with his mistress.", "When Prince Philip was asked about this time, he replied, “It’s simply what happened. The family broke up.", "My mother was ill, my sisters were married, my father was in the south of France. I just had to get on with it.", "It was Philip’s sister Theodora who put him in school under the guidance of Kurt Hahn, an education specialist who had been her father-in-law’s personal secretary.", "When Hahn—who was Jewish— left Germany after being arrested for protesting the Nazis, he established a new school in Scotland: Gordonstoun.", "It was here that Prince Philip would endure 7 a.m. wake ups, cold showers, barefoot runs and other grueling tasks.", "Later, Philip would send Prince Charles to this same school. The “self-discipline” regiment shaped Prince Philip but proved horrifying for Prince Charles, who once called this school, “Colditz in kilts,” referring to a WWII POW camp.", "While Prince Philip, age 16, was still at Gordonstoun, his sister Cecilie died tragically in a plane crash.", "At her funeral in Germany, he marched next to men in Nazi uniforms. Philip has never confirmed the family’s Nazi ties, but none of his sisters were invited to his 1947 royal wedding to Queen Elizabeth.", "In the book “Royals and the Reich,” Philip told author Jonathan Petropolous that his family was jealous of Jewish people for their financial success, but he didn’t recall specific Nazi connections."]}

It was created by NASA physician William Randolph Lovelace, who developed the physical and psychological tests used to select NASA’s first seven male astronauts for Project Mercury.", "The women completed physical and psychological tests, but before they could complete the training, the privately funded program was cancelled.", "In the Netflix documentary, one of the female pilots says NASA had “no need for women astronauts.” The space agency “didn’t want this program, pure and simple,” says Jackie Lovelace Johnson, Lovelace’s daughter.", "The documentary doesn’t provide NASA’s take, or feature interviews with historians. Directors David Sington and Heather Walsh tell the story through sit-down interviews with some of the Mercury 13 women and their relatives.", "The doc also leaves unclear why exactly one of the women, famous pilot Jacqueline Cochran, eventually testified against the program when the case was brought before Congress in 1962.", "To answer these questions, and get more context, I spoke with Margaret Weitekamp, a historian at the Smithsonian National Air and Space Museum, and author of the book", "Right Stuff, Wrong Sex: America’s First Women in Space Program. Weitekamp hadn’t seen the documentary when I talked to her, but she did tell me right away that the women shouldn’t be called the Mercury 13.", "The following interview has been edited for brevity and clarity.", "The term was invented as a catchy title in the 1990s by a television producer, but I found that it confuses the history by suggesting that the women were a part of a NASA program attached to Project Mercury, or that they gathered as a group in some way in the 1960s.", "In fact, the group never gathered until the 1990s, by which time two of the 13 had already died. I think it’s even more remarkable that these talented women pilots did so well on early medical testing, alone or in pairs, and not with the benefit of going through as a group.", "So I tend to talk about the Lovelace’s Woman in Space Program, which is what Dr. Lovelace called it, or about the First Lady Astronaut Trainees, after the way Jerrie Cobb [one of the pilots] referred to their group in her letters.", "The decision to choose the first astronaut candidates from the ranks of military-trained jet test pilots meant they were drawing from a candidate pool that could only include men.", "Women had been banned from military flying after the end of the Women Airforce Service Pilots (WASP) in 1944.", "That was a civilian program of over a thousand women that was run during the Second World War as a way of relieving male pilots for combat roles during the war, by having well-trained women pilots take over domestic flying, ferrying aircraft, towing targets, training, transporting aircraft from place to place.", "The highly successful program was disbanded in 1944 as the war was wrapping up. As the opportunities for flying in combat were shrinking, at the same time, there were more male pilots available for flying roles.", "And so they ended the Women Airforce Service Pilots and gave those jobs back to male pilots. That, for women in aviation, is a significant change because it’s really only at the end of the Second World War and into the 1950s that jet planes come into use first in the military.", "So women had very little access to that new technology.", "Lovelace was a medical doctor who had done the physical testing for NASA in the selection of the Mercury astronauts, who were announced in April of 1959.", "Before any human being had flown into space, he was very curious about what would be coming. He was envisioning huge orbiting space stations that would be able to do reconnaissance, that would do science research.", "And he’s thinking that if you’re going to have a large orbiting space station with dozens of people on it, that would normally — in that kind of military setting — include women as secretaries, telephone operators, laboratory assistants, nurses.", "So he was very curious about whether women could physically withstand the forces that would be necessary for them to participate in spaceflight.", "He ran a privately funded project at his foundation in Albuquerque, New Mexico, and invited 25 different women pilots to come out and take the same tests he had given with his team to the Project Mercury candidates, to see how women would do.", "The Netflix documentary makes it seem as if the program was secret. Is that true? NASA didn’t know about it at all?", "The program was privately run and privately financed, which meant that at least initially, not many people knew about it.", "But pretty quickly, it was relatively well-publicized. There were articles about Jerrie Cobb in LIFE magazine.", "There was an article about the project in McCall’s, a women’s magazine. It appeared on the cover of Parade magazine.", "So it may not have been very well-known, but it certainly was not a secret program.", "The documentary says the women performed better than the men. Is that accurate?", "Yes, the data show that is true. There was an Army pulmonologist, Kathy Ryan, who a few years ago did a very good piece in a physiology journal where she looked back at the test results that had been recorded for the Lovelace women as well as the Mercury astronaut candidates, and showed that especially in cardiopulmonary function, the women on average did better than the men.", "And we know that from the 1950s on, statistically, women did better in isolation tests and in sensory-deprivation tests than men did.", "That had been shown in British studies, Canadian studies, American studies. The idea that women could be included in spaceflight had been a popular discussion both in medical circles and in general popular culture in the late 1950s.", "Why was Lovelace’s Woman in Space Program cancelled? Did NASA shut it down?", "NASA didn’t start it. NASA didn’t shut it down. What happened was, the privately funded tests Lovelace did got canceled, because he had run through all the tests he could do at his own private facilities.", "He was hoping to start a new phase of tests that would use the Navy medical facilities in Pensacola, Florida.", "And there was no requirement for such tests from the military, in a military sense of a requirement, where you create a program to do things and then allocate funds to do that.", "There was no military program or government program that was going to use women astronauts, and therefore they withdrew the favor of being able to use the facilities.", "In my opinion, what really ended the chance that at this early moment in the human spaceflight program, there might have been some experimentation and the inclusion of a woman, was Kennedy’s decision to go to the Moon.", "On May 25th, 1961, Kennedy gets up before a joint session of Congress and says, “We will send a man to the Moon and return him safely to the Earth before the end of the decade.”", "And that policy decision about the next step in human spaceflight was made very early. The United States had only had one human spaceflight, the suborbital flight of Alan Shepard, only 15 minutes of practical human spaceflight experience, and Kennedy is saying they’re gonna go a quarter of a million miles to the Moon and back, and land and walk around.", "That really streamlines the decisions being made within NASA about the directions for human spaceflight.", "The moment when someone might have been able to be persuaded to do the experiments of seeing how a woman would fare flying in space really ends with that decision to streamline the space program toward the Moon landing.", "They had one goal that didn’t include the social experimentation of flying a woman, and they were then legitimately concerned about the political ramifications of having any flights that seemed off of the lunar focus.", "Certainly they worried a lot about, if anything happened to a woman on a flight, whether that would end all human spaceflight programs.", "In the Netflix documentary, some interviewees say NASA didn’t want the program, or to see women in space at all.", "Is that accurate? Does it overstate the conspiratorial image?", "I think the story gets told in two different ways: as a door shut in the face of these women, or a door briefly opened for them.", "And I think in the larger history on women’s accomplishments that require physicality and moving into traditionally masculine realms, you see a lot of beginnings of programs, or beginnings of opportunities for women, and then that rolls back, and then it comes back again 15 years later.", "I’ve been fascinated by this story of a privately funded women’s astronaut testing project, because it was a moment when some people, who were highly recognized and had great reputations in the medical community, took women seriously as medical subjects in an era when that just wasn’t done.", "Most pharmaceutical research, until very recently, excluded women. Most medical experiments would have excluded women, because the medical profession worried that women’s monthly cycles made them unreliable test subjects.", "For the doctor who NASA trusted with its physical testing to be looking at women not as flawed men, but perhaps as astronaut candidates who could even be more physically suitable than men were — that’s a remarkable opening of a door in the very early 1960s.", "There just wasn’t the support yet that would have helped them keep it open. The women’s organizations that might have advocated for these women simply didn’t exist yet.", "Who was Jacqueline Cochran, and what role did she play in the program?", "Cochran is a fascinating historical character, in that she was great friends with Randy Lovelace. She was a contemporary pilot of Amelia Earhart, she was a record-setting pilot in her own right, and married to one of the richest men in America, Floyd Odlum.", "So she had access to great resources. She had actually been the head of the Women Airforce Service Pilots during the Second World War.", "So she is the funder for Lovelace’s Woman in Space Program. At the end, she actually testified against the women at the house subcommittee hearing.", "“there’s a slow evolving story of women struggling to have their capabilities recognized.”", "It’s not written down anywhere. She never wrote down exactly, “This is why I did that.” My conclusion as a historian is that she hoped that the program could be revived in a different form under NASA’s auspices, and that she would be the head of that, the way she had been the head of the Women Airforce Service Pilots during the Second World War.", "I think as a politically astute person, she saw that the project as done by Lovelace was not going to go forward in any real way in that moment in the early 1960s, and she worked behind the scenes throughout the 1960s to try to influence NASA to start a women’s program.", "She did an extended term as a consultant to the agency, and was very pleased with the association with such a powerful agency.", "Why is it important to know about these trailblazing women?", "The history of women’s ongoing struggle for recognition — intellectually, politically, socially, culturally — is rooted in the understanding of women’s capabilities.", "And this is an important first look at women as physically capable. I think that when we look at the ways women are still struggling to be recognized, in boardrooms or in the Supreme Court, or the White House, or in Congress, there’s a slowly evolving story of women struggling to have their capabilities recognized.", "And this is an important early episode where someone took women and their bodies seriously, as capable."]}

That being said, the heart or hand alone can’t do calculus, and require the brain to guide higher-order behaviors which may prove useful in an increasingly complex environment.", "It’s tempting to think that delegation fulfills this role within human organizations, that it’s analogous to the biological coordination above.", "But if we dig a bit deeper, we realize that’s not the case. Even in the calculus example, the brain has never explicitly declared writing to be the responsibility of the hand.", "No, the relationship emerged over time as a function of advantageously coordinated behaviors given environmental pressures.", "So long as one acknowledges evolution, it would seem that the same organizing principle must hold true for the relationships between all other parts of the body, at every scale, given that they were defined by precisely the same processes.", "What might we say about such an organizing principle?

The functional and structural relationships between biological sub-components emerge from the tension between each part’s desire to pursue its specific needs — its freedoms — and the benefits conferred to the whole by coordinating its actions with the needs of larger groups — its responsibilities.", "To survive, an organism (or organization) must respond at every level of being to changing environmental pressures over time.", "And to the extent its parts can balance their freedoms and responsibilities, their intentions in tension, both the whole and its parts will thrive.", "So it is that some things are increased by being diminished, and others are diminished by being increased.", "We now return, full circle, to the patterns of subjective thought with which we began the previous section.", "In light of our discussion concerning the emergence of cooperative biological structures, we see more clearly the forces guiding relationships between individuals, teams, and other groups within organizations.", "To the extent these parts of the whole pursue both their freedoms and responsibilities in the world, they must also decide how to act.", "But the requirement of action poses a problem: to act one must decide what matters; action mandates the prioritization of specific information and the exclusion of all else from current consideration.", "But what allows a person — or group of people — to discern the difference between signal and noise, to set a course of action when faced with infinite information?", "Evolution solves this problem using heuristics. For simplicity’s sake, one may think of heuristics as mental shortcuts.", "Cognitive psychology reveals that we use these mental shortcuts constantly. Most of the time we act without thinking; instead we rely upon an unconscious track record of prior actions and outcomes given similar situations.", "For example, we rarely ponder the task of placing one foot in front of the other, nor do we contemplate how to pick up a glass of water to take a sip.", "These processes have become automatic. And like these automatic processes, much of the work we do each day also runs on autopilot.", "For example, how often do you consciously think before checking your email? Much of what your brain does, when you think about it, is search for new ways to not think about it.", "It does so for two main reasons. First, evaluating all potentially relevant pieces of information takes an absurd amount of time.", "In other words, most of our overly-philosophical ancestors likely ended their careers as lion-food. Second, conscious thought and deliberation use more energy.", "So unless your thoughts produce value for you or your group (ideally both), you’re wasting resources.", "Both of these evolutionary truths apply equally to organizations within the economy. If you’re too slow, your competition will eat you.", "If you waste too many resources, you’ll run out of money and fail. Given the stark consequences of wasting conscious attention, it proves advantageous to develop the habit of ignoring as much information as possible, while focusing one’s conscious energy upon what matters.", "But what does this look like in an organization within which most decisions and actions remain explicit?", "Both the Tao and Netflix’s culture of freedom and responsibility provide similar answers. The process of evaluating connected opposites in tension narrows the domain of possibilities to only those at the intersection of relevant information and pragmatic solutions.", "As one discusses a problem — with either oneself or a group — the framework of freedom and responsibility provides continuous constraints while also leading to new ideas.", "It’s amazing how few solutions allow for the maintenance of present and future freedom of action while remaining responsible to the obligations of the employee, of the team, and of the company.", "Furthermore, because the conversation resembles a process of unfolding discovery, it’s less likely that individuals will take offense to the exclusion of their ideas or monopolize credit for the end-result.", "Within the context of Taoist freedom and responsibility, conversations diverge and converge, cyclically, casting off irrelevant information and eventually settling upon robust solutions.", "I like to visualize this process as planets orbiting the star of Tao, whose opposing forces of freedom and responsibility attract that which is both relevant and possible.", "Furthermore this gravitational attraction determines the system’s structure over time. Extending the metaphor, planets represent solved problems, brought into a stable orbit.", "As the system moves through the economic universe of potential problems, the vast majority will pass by, probed by the Tao’s gravity but lacking the properties required by this specific system.", "Some might compromise freedom, others might be irresponsible. A small portion of problems, however, are both solvable and relevant within the cultural framework; it’s these that gain the system’s attention — its attraction — until they too are solved and may settle into orbit with fellow solved problems.", "Occasionally cosmic interlopers play the role of black swan: disruptive asteroids and comets which explode prior solutions into a constellation of new internal problems, though they also free previously unavailable resources.", "In this conceptual cosmos, as in our own, we must pay attention; but survival depends just as much — or perhaps even more — upon knowing what to ignore.", "“A man with outward courage dares to die; a man with inner courage dares to live.”", "So far, we’ve shown how intention in tension encourages the emergence of healthy organizational structure and function.", "We’ve also seen that conscious action — otherwise known as creation — requires focused attention and the filtering of irrelevant information — less euphemistically put: exclusion.", "But to sustain health while responding to an ever-changing landscape, an organization must do more than develop valuable structures and take action: it must understand how to transform itself without destroying itself.", "And because transformation includes both creation and destruction, it must prevent this creative destruction from escaping beyond the boundaries of the desired transformation.", "This Promethean task is, quite literally, playing with fire; and to play with fire requires courage. But not just any courage will do.", "To play with fire sustainably requires the courage that flows from wisdom.", "Furthermore, how might this courageous wisdom allow an organization to repeatedly navigate transformations that to outsiders appear all but magical?", "For example, in the year 2000 it was by no means obvious that an online lessor of DVDs would transform itself into one of the most technologically advanced companies of the 21st century.", "And again, in 2012 it was by no means obvious that by 2017 a video streaming service would create its own media empire and outcompete the world’s largest studios for talent.", "None of this was obvious, but it certainly required courage. And that courage flowed from organizational wisdom.", "All of which begs the question: from where does such wisdom flow?", "The lazy answer is, of course, experience. Elders who would seek to extort status from mere existence push this idea, and find themselves resented by those with fewer years and more to show for each.", "Such charlatans are not wise, nor are they courageous, and few will follow them across the transformational tightrope once, let alone repeatedly.", "While helpful, experience alone does not generate wisdom. Here again, we may look to the Tao. To gain wisdom, one must first embrace the fundamental constant of transformation itself.", "Though this may sound easy, it’s anything but. Most — if not all — acknowledge the conceptual necessity of transformation.", "Obviously everyone wants to believe they’re prepared for transformation, but when the foreboding seas of meaningful change beckon, most cling fearfully to the shores of the known.", "Few make the painful sacrifices necessary to set sail. Conversely, wisdom also requires avoiding the opposing pathology of transformation for its own sake.", "This pathology often hides its uninformed disdain for all prior structure behind the mask of good will, and its forward-fixation belies an unhealthy attraction to the destructive spirits which hide behind creative facades.", "Therefore wisdom is born of the struggle between that which must change and that which must remain. So long as one maintains this balance in the face of adversity, wisdom grows within.", "In English, “Tao” translates to the “Way”, or “Path”, a concept that maps well to the definition of wisdom above.", "Walking this middle path of transformation harmonizes one’s own evolution with that of their surroundings.", "And the longer one maintains this harmony — the further one walks in wisdom — the less one will experience fear when initiating necessary transformations or rejecting the unnecessary.", "In shedding this fear one discovers courage. It’s this distinct form of courage, derived from wisdom and unique to every individual and organization, that contains and harnesses the volatile engine of creative destruction.", "“My words are very easy to know, and very easy to practice; but there is no one in the world who is able to know and able to practice them”", "As alluded to in the paradoxical quote above, it proves difficult to practice an evolving pattern of behavior while also attempting to know it explicitly.", "The moment one begins to codify successful patterns of past behavior into words and rules, the problems of present and future begin to slip through the cracks.", "Herein lies the primary weakness of most company slogans: once uttered they begin to die, eventually laid to rest as inert shells of their former selves — unable to animate action or inspire direction.", "Therefore, when shaping culture with language, one must surmount the challenge of encapsulating its vital essence without inadvertently killing it in its cradle.", "Luckily we stand at the terminus of a rich cultural tapestry, woven across millennia. Countless generations of ancestors have torn hard-fought wisdom from the hands of the gods, and it’s our obligation — our responsibility — to carry forth that existential value.", "If we wish to revitalize the old and empower the new we must connect our ancient wisdom to present challenges, taking the time to look back while moving ever-faster forward.", "It’s no mere concept; when implemented correctly one feels the reverberations of historical wisdom in their bones.", "Echoing within our nature, one senses its power as fellow humans self-organize to solve complex challenges in ways previously considered impossible.", "When nourished it emerges, layer upon layer, upward from the tension within the individual’s mind and outward as an immaterial force, invisibly guiding the whole of humanity.", "As we generate ever more information and seek the guidance of increasingly deterministic analytical tools, we amplify the risk of imbalance.", "We amplify this risk at our peril, as individuals, teams, companies, and cultures more generally. Hyper-analytic shortsightedness remains shortsighted, and by failing to understand the invisible cultural forces connecting us we jeopardize the potential within all we encounter.", "In an increasingly connected world, we must embrace strategies to help us to navigate the challenges of exploding complexity.", "And though many strategies will — and should — remain forward-focused, we cannot afford to forget the power of the wisdom we already possess.", "Discovering echoes of Taoism within Netflix’s cultural paradigm of freedom and responsibility presents one such example, but more exist.", "Their unlimited potential increasingly lies unharnessed beneath a crust of technologically empowered arrogance, and yearns to be unearthed by those with the courage and wisdom to look back before blindly moving forward.", "But with such powers unearthed and harnessed — with past wisdom and future potential in balance — I know of nothing that can stop the Human Spirit from fulfilling its awe-inspiring potential, from ascending to its divine purpose in the universe.", "If these ideas resonate with you, I’d appreciate your willingness to spread the message however you see fit.", "This isn’t my day job, though I’d like it to be.

Context is defined as something to embrace, and includes strategy, objectives, clearly defined roles, knowledge of the stakes and transparency around decision-making.", "This is opposed to control, meaning top-down decision-making, management approval, and valuing planning over results – all of which should be avoided, and are increasingly being shunned thanks to strategic decisions like flexible hours policies.", "The company’s values include the expectation that employees will “keep [Netflix] nimble by minimising complexity and finding time to simplify”.", "By trusting employees in this way, Netflix benefits from a strategic agility that extends throughout the company’s structure.", "A great strategy is worthless if it’s not implemented correctly. Organisations with agile capabilities are more likely to succeed in implementing their strategic initiatives.", "Data from Brightline Initiative’s survey shows that leading companies are often faster and more effective at the following three tasks: reallocating funding in strategy implementation initiatives; reallocating personnel in implementation initiatives; and adjusting strategy when implementation reveals new risks or opportunities.", "Organisations use many different projects and programmes to deliver their strategic goals. Therefore, adopting one single approach or set of practices to deal with diverse, complex and dynamic programmes will put the organisation at risk.", "The solution: consider a wide range of delivery approaches.", "Take Volkswagen, for example. As part of its overarching goals for strategy, the company recognised that some aspects of its operations required agility, while in other areas there was a need for established processes.", "As such, different strategic approaches have been taken in each aspect of its operations. The key, according to the Brightline Initiative survey, is that “those in charge of strategy implementation keep everyone headed towards a common destination”.", "The ideal solution relies on the organisation’s ability to effectively choose and use the right delivery approach for its strategy.", "It can be predictive, iterative, incremental, agile or hybrid. According to the Project Management Institute’s 2018 Pulse of the Profession report, Success in Disruptive Times: “Success starts with the right approach to support project delivery.", "Organisations will continue to use more than one project management approach and combine different techniques to cope with their own distinct challenges.", "Regardless of the approach used, organisations that use some type of formal project management approach are more successful in meeting their goals, within budget and on time.”", "Organisational ambidexterity is the ability of an entity to successfully operate in the present, but also to anticipate what operational changes might be needed in the future.", "To achieve strategic agility in today’s business environment, organisations need to create different structures to adapt to various circumstances.", "Brightline Initiative’s principles focus on this adaptability and highlight the importance of “inspiring and assigning the right people to get the job done”.", "Given the diverse set of programmes organisations run simultaneously, they must assign the right people to each initiative and develop the structures to run the business day-to-day and change things when necessary.", "Take Bosch, for example. In its 2017 annual report, the company stated that it would restructure departments to build “cross-functional purpose teams”.", "In practice, this means entire departments made up of small teams bringing together experts from completely different disciplines, such as engineering, marketing and logistics.", "Volkswagen, meanwhile, is adopting a ‘two-speed model’, where some facets of the business will focus on proven – and sometimes slower – processes that lead to reliable products.", "In other areas, where the organisation will require faster processes, the firm is adopting agile structures.", "To truly achieve structural ambidexterity and successfully deliver strategies regardless of the environment in which the business operates, leaders need to constantly promote and nurture team engagement and cross-business cooperation.", "It’s critical to govern transparently to engender trust and enhance cooperation, as supported by Brightline’s principles.", "Strategic agility does not exist in isolation. It must be thought of as a combination of a culture of trust, the right delivery capabilities, and an ambidextrous structure to help teams work faster and more effectively in varied conditions."]}

Highlights of Financial Results for the 1st Quarter", "Consolidated sales for the first quarter of the fiscal year ending March 2019 increased by 1.9% YoY to 1,221.7 billion yen.", "For consolidated operating income, even though mobile communications revenue fell by 11.2 billion yen due to a temporary drop in revenue as a result of new price plans, increased value-added ARPA revenues and the Business and Global Services segments, resulting in 288.9 billion yen (+7.4 billion yen YoY, 2.6% increase).", "For the consolidated operating income in the annual plan, this represents strong progress at 28.3% of the target.", "In the domestic telecom business, the number of subscribers has increased significantly for both KDDI's \"au Pitatto Plan,\" which enables customers with low data usage to have rates with great value, and the \"au Flat Plan,\" which is exceeded for customers who use large amounts of data, and total subscribers passed 8 million on May 31.", "Also, the au price plan satisfaction* for the one year since the launch of the new rate plans has continued to improve.", "Looking ahead, with our \"au Flat Plan 25 Netflix Pack\" as a start, KDDI will continue to offer new experience value that exceeds customer expectations and that goes beyond simple price plans.", "With the result of these initiatives also having a positive effect, the au churn rate for the first quarter was 0.71% (0.2 percentage point drop YoY).", "In life design businesses, the au Economic Zone gross merchandise value was 561.0 billion yen (32.8% increase YoY), au Economic Zone sales were 144.0 billion yen (21.0% increase YoY), value-added ARPA was 660 yen (17.9% increase YoY), and so these indicators all showed two-digit growth compared to the same period last year.", "This operation data is being led by continued strong growth in the number of au Smart Pass Premium members (5 million as of the end of June 2018) and number of valid issued au WALLET credit cards (3.6 million as of the end of June 2018).", "- What is the expected negative impact of the new price plan campaigns after July of this fiscal year?", "Although mobile communications revenues fell in 1Q, customers have expressed satisfaction with the new price plans (au Pitatto Plan, au Flat Plan), and we think that customers feel that these rates are appealing.", "Moving forward, we expect that the impact of the campaigns will be reduced, and we are anticipating higher au ARPA.", "As au Pitatto Plan contributes to increase au ARPA revenues as data usage increases, we think that the promoting of content services will result in stronger mobile communications revenues through higher data ARPU in the Pitatto Plan and shifting to the au Flat Plan by extension, and shifting of more subscribers to content-bundled plans such as the Netflix Plan.", "Furthermore, please note that, for subscribers using the new price plan, the campaigns apply only to new customers and customers who have changed their model.", "- Other company is offering a 50GB plan and bigger data capacities (Y!mobile). As more and more users feel that data capacities are a selling point, how do you feel about offering a high-capacity plan such as a 50GB plan in the future?", "The recently-announced Netflix plan is our first plan bundling content and communication, and the data volume will be 25GB.", "However, as you pointed out, some customers prefer high data plans, and we are considering offering high data plans while observing international trends.", "Also, regarding the increase in data capacity by Y!mobile, its concept is different from the au Pitatto Plan, and we are not planning to immediately follow this move.", "The Y!mobile price plan was made with an eye on UQ mobile, but KDDI is not in a position to comment on the UQ mobile price plan.", "- What is your feeling on the medium-term scale of the IoT business and its prospects for growth?", "We would like sales to reach 100 billion yen within several years, which is two or three times the current level.", "- The churn rate has dropped dramatically, and the number of mobile IDs has also increased in tandem.", "However, what is the 1Q competitive environment and the factors for the increase in the number of mobile IDs?", "For 1Q, we are aware that the au Pitatto Plan has contributed to our competitive advantage. The competitive environment for the overall market is calm, and the continued steady acquisition of new au subscriptions and higher customer satisfaction in follow-up and other services are considered to be the factors in low churn rates and the growing number of mobile IDs.", "Also, MVNOs are acquiring subscriptions at a strong pace, and competition by MNOs has cooled down.", "- What are the factors for YoY doubling of the 1Q operating income in the Global Services segment, and what are the trends for future higher income?", "In addition to higher income, including the change in the accounting period for Myanmar businesses, data center businesses and Mongol businesses also contributed to higher income.", "Looking ahead, although we will not have a rate of growth like 1Q, which was affected by the temporary impact of the change in the accounting period, we expect income to grow steadily.", "- The Life Design Services segment is showing strong growth, but can you tell me specifically which services are doing well within the au Economic Zone gross merchandise value?", "The 1Q results for the au Economic Zone gross merchandise value were 561 billion yen (YoY +38.5%) for a current year forecast of 2,460 billion yen and a progress rate of 22.6%.", "The au Economic Zone gross merchandise value includes services effective in sales and retention such as EC and electric power and services that contribute to income such as au Smart Pass and au Carrier Billing, and our company stance is naturally to use both of these services as drivers of growth.", "Specifically, au Smart Pass is contributing to value-added ARPA revenues and operating income. Particularly, the number of au Smart Pass Premium members continues to grow and reached 5 million as of the end of June 2018.", "Also, au Smart Pass Premium members have risen to 32% of all au Smart Pass members, and this is driving higher value-added ARPA revenue.", "In addition, the EC services Wowma! and au Denki (electric power service) are also proceeding as planned and showing steady growth.", "- The au churn rate has improved to its best level yet over the last several years, and so is our understanding correct that the noticeable drop in au churn rates is due to bundling with life design services?", "That's right. The electric power, commerce, and credit card services that are driving the au Economic zone gross merchandise value have been effective at reducing cancellations.", "We have been reminded that it is extremely important to combine communication and life design into a bundle in this way for expanding the au Economic Zone gross merchandise value and reducing the au churn rate.", "- M&A have been made over the last several years, and this has been effective at retention for au, but for the companies acquired by M&A, what synergies are there?", "For J:COM, fixed line and mobile lines are bundled in the au Smart Value package for reducing the churn rate and contributing to more subscribers for both sides.", "We think that we should provide an opportunity for companies acquired by M&A in the current medium-term plan to explain their resulting synergies.", "- Even though the au Smart Pass Premium is 127 yen more expensive per month than the regular au Smart Pass, why does it continue to gain more members?", "The au Smart Pass Premium has two major features. The first is \"au Everyday,\" offering discounts on a wide range of online and offline services every day.", "The other feature is enhanced safety services such as security measures for smartphones. We think that these are the factors in users selecting this package.", "- Reorganization of businesses with low profitability in the Global Services segment refers to specifically what businesses, and what is the effect on the results?", "One case is the shrinkage of the MVNO business in the United States. Another case is the streamlining of the voice wholesale business overseas due to the drop in legacy voice system demand.", "The size of their sales was significant, but they had almost no impact on income.", "- What are the variable factors for the \"Other\" category in sales cash flow? Also, what are the factors absorbing the increase in accounts receivable in future cash flow?", "In 1Q of the previous term, the primary factor was sales returns due to expiring reward points, which resulted in booking of losses for the sales cash flow and had an effect on accounts payable.", "Our outlook going forward is that the growth range for installments receivable is expected to be stable, and no other temporary effects or large fluctuations are expected.", "- What are the factors for the YoY drop in the \"Other\" category for operating revenue in the Life Design Services segment?", "This was because the group company changed sales from gross accounting to net accounting, and this was incorporated into the forecast for the entire year."]}

With two of the most likely candidates now gone, the only digital players remaining who are both big enough to afford the deal and for whom it potentially makes enough strategic sense are likely Verizon, Google and Amazon (I’m excluding Yahoo since its own instability almost certainly precludes a bid).", "Bloomberg’s source said Facebook didn’t like the NFL’s ad policy for the games and also didn’t like the London games that come with the deal.", "All of that may well be true, but, as I was quoted in Variety last month, I think a big sticking point was also the lack of mobile rights to the games, which are held by Verizon through next season.", "With the vast majority of Facebook’s usage now on mobile devices, the inability to stream to mobile surely diminished the value of the deal to Facebook.", "Of the 3 remaining players, I’d handicap Verizon as the most likely eventual winner. As mentioned above, it has mobile rights already.", "Go90 is a major priority for the company, so folding in the NFL games would be a big boost. With Verizon’s strategy shifting from multichannel video to mobile, proving that marquee content can be streaming to millions via mobile would be a great proof point.", "Finally, via its AOL acquisition, Verizon has also become big player in ad tech and data, both of which could be very useful in monetizing the games (and which the NFL would no doubt like to learn from as well).", "Amazon has also placed a huge emphasis on video, but it’s critical to remember that for the e-commerce giant, video is in service to its Prime membership subscriptions, rather than being a standalone revenue stream.", "Over the past couple of years, Amazon has proven to itself that on-demand entertainment video can drive Prime acquisitions and retention.", "But there’s no such proof for live sports, so bidding for the NFL rights would be a blind swing for Amazon, something the company is not known for doing.", "It’s always impossible to discount Google from any bidding situation given its deep pockets. The NFL deal could add value to the still amorphous YouTube Red subscription service, and it could also complement YouTube’s pending YouTube Connect live streaming feature.", "No doubt Google would have some creative ways to monetize the games as well.", "Still, it’s hard to see how the NFL games fit into an over-arching Google or YouTube strategy. And remember, since Google hired CFO Ruth Porat a year ago, the company has split its moonshot projects into a separate company so core Alphabet spending is much more rigorously evaluated.", "Any big NFL bid would need to have clear business case support.", "There’s one other wildcard path to consider, which is that the NFL does a course correction and instead awards the streaming rights to CBS and NBC for an incremental fee to their new Thursday night deals (remember they currently only include authenticated streaming).", "For CBS in particular, Thursday night streaming rights could fit well with CBS All Access.", "The whole Thursday night digital bidding approach is really a big experiment by the NFL to see if it can triple dip for broadcast rights, because in addition to the games being split by CBS and NBC, they’re also on NFL Network.", "It’s certainly possible that the NFL could ultimately decide against a digital-only deal, recognizing there’s more synergy and upside by having its broadcast partners stream as well.", "With a lot of uncertainty in the sports TV business in general these days, it’s conceivable that the digital players will bid modestly, in order to see how TV rights deals evolve in the face of increasing pushback by pay-TV operators against absorbing higher carriage fees.", "In other words, rather than setting an expensive streaming precedent themselves, they could take a wait-and-see approach as turmoil in the sports TV business continues to unfold.", "All of this is part of the highly unsettled TV/video landscape we’re all witnessing.", "(Update: Twitter has officially been announced as the unlikely winner of the NFL's Thursday Night games.", "Professional Formation for mineral processing engineers.", "8yI'm just hoping we ALL don't wind up paying for a product of limited (to no) personal interest.
