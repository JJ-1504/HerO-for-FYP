Netflix is in second with 18%, and then it drops dramatically to 10% for Amazon Prime Video.", "Disney+ has the lowest demand share across the major platforms clocking in at just 4.6% total demand — but that’s not at all entirely surprising.", "Disney+ is the home for heavily branded, family oriented, franchise specific series. In the United States specifically, it exists as its own entity that embodies the Disney brand.", "Families and fans know what they’re getting for $8 a month when they sign up. There are some outliers (Hamilton) and Disney is clearly open to experimenting within those restrictions (The Simpsons, Black is King, and National Geographic’s catalog spring to mind), but it exists as a home for what Disney is and what it will continue to become.", "Hulu isn’t Disney+.

On its own, that’s a problem.", "Demand share for Hulu originals sits at 7.2% despite being the longest running SVOD service.

Unlike Star, which carries content from across Disney’s entire catalog of brands (ABC, FX, FXX, Searchlight, 20th Century Studios, and Freeform), Hulu carries content from a number of different partners.", "Under the contracts signed, Disney might not be able to move those titles off one platform and onto another without renegotiation and higher costs.", "Hulu + Live TV is another factor. What happens to the live TV offering that includes Hulu if the majority of content on Hulu moves over to Disney+?", "Not to mention that Comcast still has a 10% stake in Hulu that is currently valued at around $9 billion.", "Disney moving the bulk of content onto Disney+ as an additional tab for Disney+ subscribers, therefore solely benefitting Disney, that’s a legal battle no one wants.", "All data points to Hulu being a valuable part of the bundle for Disney, especially in the coming years when Disney+’s subscriber base will hit saturation and the House of Mouse wants to use any possible strategy to keep churn rates low.", "Hulu, for now, is a complementary service — one that Disney might invest more in post-buying out Comcast’s stake.", "As far as the colloquial streaming wars go, Disney is in a good spot. Its various streaming services are seeing growth, there’s a good breadth of content across various genre on both Hulu and Disney+, and it doesn’t seem like demand for Marvel or Star Wars is slowing down anytime soon.", "Still, with a merging WarnerMedia and Discovery on the horizon, and tech giants like Netflix, Apple, and Amazon ready to invest tens of billions on content, Disney has competition — and it’s in this space that Hulu will need to help Disney’s streaming ambitions thrive."]}

It’s not even recorded as an intangible asset.", "However, a company’s transaction history, including mergers and acquisitions, bankruptcy filings, and data sales, can provide insight into what a company’s data may be worth.", "If a company is acquired, for example, then that data will ultimately become part of the acquiring company’s goodwill.", "For example, Microsoft bought LinkedIn for $26.2 billion in 2016, the company’s largest acquisition ever.", "At the time, LinkedIn had 433 million users, 106 million of which were monthly active users (MAUs).8 Some quick math reveals that Microsoft valued each user at $61, or each MAU at $247.", "Today, LinkedIn’s current user base is much higher at 706 million globally, which would put the company’s value at about $43 billion, holding all else equal.9", "Along the same lines of historical social media transactions, Facebook’s acquisition of Instagram in 2012 valued each MAU at $20.10 TikTok’s US operations recent estimated valuation of $60 billion values each of their 100 million MAUs in the US at $600.11", "This approach equates active social media users (MAUs) to data. Users provide personal information, create and share digital content, and consume advertisements.", "For many social media platforms, users are both the product that creates the data and the consumer that allows that data to be valuable (by getting served ads).", "Therefore, equating users with data can be an appropriate approach for social media platforms.", "But the value of a social media user can fluctuate over time. Looking at Facebook’s historical value based on market capitalization, the market has priced each user between $150 and $420 since Facebook’s public debut.", "When Facebook IPO’ed in 2012, its value per MAU was $265, almost the same level as its $272/MAU valuation in Q3 2020.", "Despite these fluctuations, Facebook has steadily improved its monetization of each user. Average quarterly revenue per user was just $1.30 in Q2 2012.", "In Q3 2020, it was $7.89. The better a company is at monetizing each user, the more valuable the data on each user becomes.", "Yet also factoring in to the valuation of a company is expectations for growth. Even though Facebook has better monetized its users over the last eight years, user growth has slowed, resulting in little overall change in value per MAU.", "Another approach to value data looks to set at least a minimum valuation by considering the cost of data collection, storage, and analysis.", "In theory, no data would be stored if it’s less valuable than the total cost of ownership. Not accounting for collection costs, data stored in the cloud could cost approximately $0.02/GB, or $1.00/ 50 GB of storage capacity per month.12", "Looking at Netflix, for example, we can attempt to isolate the value of Netflix’s user data. By collecting browsing data from its millions of users, Netflix better understands their customers’ behaviors and preferences, giving it a competitive advantage in determining what types of movies and shows they produce.", "The cost-based method of valuing Netflix’s user data therefore looks to estimate how much browsing data is collected, the cost of storing and analyzing this data, and calculating its net present value.", "- Cost of storing data in the cloud = $0.02/GB per month or $0.24/GB per year13", "- Average minutes browsing on Netflix = 7.4 minutes/day14", "- Average amount of data created per minute of browsing = 102MB/minute15", "- Data created: 7.4 minutes/day x 102MB/minute x 365 days/year = 275.5GB per person per year", "- 275.5GB x $0.24/GB = $66 annual total cost of data storage per user", "Based on these results and the estimated number of Netflix’s users over the next three years, we can estimate the net present value of the firm’s user data from this cost-based approach to be $12.4 billion.16 In other words, the cost-based approach implies that Netflix’s user data is worth 6% of Netflix’s market cap.17", "The cost-based approach can present several drawbacks. One is that estimating the cost of data storage varies significantly as firms can negotiate pricing with data storage providers or build their own data centers.", "In addition, it’s difficult to estimate how much data that is created is ultimately stored, and if so, for how long.", "The cost-based method is also only setting a minimum bar for the value of the data, but does not seek to determine the future benefit of that data.", "In the case of Netflix, its lengthy history of collecting user data is a clear advantage over newer streaming entrants, and therefore could be worth much more than the cost-based approach implies.", "Last, the cost of storage is only one variable of the many used to effectively monetize data. Collection and analysis costs, for example, can often be greater than the cost of storage.", "As such, not accounting for all variables could result in underestimating the intrinsic value of a company’s data.", "The data a company converts directly to free cash flow can also provide insight into what data is truly worth.", "For example, consumer credit reporting agency Equifax sells information about individual consumers and businesses, including credit history, current credit status, payment history, and address information.", "The company has 105 million active records in its database, generating $3.9 billion in annual revenue and $1.3 billion in annual EBITDA.18, 19 Those figures translate to $37 in annual revenue per record.", "Twitter provides another example for directly licensing data. Companies can pay to access Twitter’s historical and real-time data stemming from over 500 million daily tweets.", "They license this data to generate insights for product launches, identify consumer trends, or even inform investing activities.", "Over the last five years, Twitter’s data licensing revenue has grown from $56 million in Q3 2015 to $128 million in Q3 2020.20 Moreover, looking at the present value of future cash flows from that business vertical over the next 5 years, we could estimate the value of that data to be worth $2.8 billion, or approximately 8% of Twitter’s market cap.21", "In a cash flow-based analysis, an analyst may look at the cash being derived from existing data, forecast its growth, and discount those values back to present day value.", "An important factor to consider though is that data has increasing returns to scale. In other words, if a company doubles the amount of data it has, it could triple the value of that data.", "This is exhibited by Chinese food delivery giant Meituan Dianping, which benefits from strong network effects: the more shoppers that use Meituan Dianping’s platform, the more sellers are drawn to using the app, creating a virtuous cycle of data collection, usage, and value across these two groups.", "The same principle holds true for many data-rich companies; the more data they collect, the better the product, and the more users they attract, who in turn provide more data to the system.", "This is a major reason why we see such dominant players and concentrated industries in social media, search, and e-commerce.", "Therefore, in developing a cash flow-based analysis, one must not just consider the current value of data, but how the value of that data may grow as a platform gathers more and more complementary information.", "While we present a few methods for valuing data, exactly what data companies have and how they monetize it often remains a well-guarded secret.", "But what we do know is that the world is producing data on an accelerating growth trajectory and the value of that data is likely quickly growing as well.", "The companies already adept at collecting and managing data are likely to be among the best positioned to gather additional data in the future and effectively monetize this asset.", "Data services and hardware companies, including those that turn unstructured data into structured data, like AI development, AI-as-a-Service (AIaaS), AI hardware, and quantum computing companies, are also likely to benefit from a greater emphasis data, as firms look to greatly accelerate their investments in data for rapidly digitalizing world.", "AIQ: The Global X Future Analytics Tech ETF (AIQ) seeks to invest in companies that potentially stand to benefit from the further development and utilization of artificial intelligence (AI) technology in their products and services, as well as in companies that provide hardware facilitating the use of AI for the analysis of big data.", "BOTZ: The Global X Robotics & Artificial Intelligence ETF (BOTZ) seeks to invest in companies that potentially stand to benefit from increased adoption and utilization of robotics and artificial intelligence (AI), including those involved with industrial robotics and automation, non-industrial robots, and autonomous vehicles.", "SOCL: The Global X Social Media ETF (SOCL) seeks to provide investment results that correspond generally to the price and yield performance, before fees and expenses, of the Solactive Social Media Total Return Index.", "CLOU: The Global X Cloud Computing ETF (CLOU) seeks to invest in companies positioned to benefit from the increased adoption of cloud computing technology, including companies whose principal business is in offering computing Software-as-a-Service (SaaS), Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS), Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS), managed server storage space and data center real estate investment trusts, and/or cloud and edge computing infrastructure and hardware.", "DTCR: The Global X Data Center & Digital Infrastructure ETF seeks to invest in companies that operate data center REITs and other digital infrastructure supporting the growth of communication networks."]}

Will they leverage their experience as a broadcaster driving tune in, or mimic the Netflix/Amazons of the world?", "(Reasoning: Will be intriguing to see if they have thought about this important question.

They’d benefit most from going week-to-week.)", "- Will any of the movies from “the vault” rotate in and out of circulation?", "(It is incredible to me that ALL of Disney’s movies will be available in one place. Imagine how much everyone used to spend on DVDs and VHS before them.", "But we already know that some new movies (like Star Wars) will move to TNT’s output deal. I wouldn’t be surprised if that happens to Marvel films too.", "But will Disney keep the old animated films mostly stable, and not put them back in “the vault”?

Disney hasn’t gone dark on Charter, yet, but how they handle the fees which drive their profit engine—via ESPN—while carving out content for their new streaming platform is a key to the future growth.", "- How much money are you projecting in losses this year?", "(The key to watch is which way this is trending, a la Netflix. Whoever can get streaming profitable first will have a huge leg up in the coming #streamingwars.)", "(I hate promotional pricing. Offering one month free samples makes sense; cutting the monthly price always seems to backfire.", "See my writing on Hulu here at Decider on why Hulu had to keep a lower promotional price going forward.)", "(Like most, I'm obsessed with the shiny new object which is Disney+. But ESPN+ and Hulu each have their own bundles of subscribers, which Disney has selectively linked in the past.", "Any leaks on the subscriber numbers here will help us figure out if Disney really can launch their new streaming platform.)", "- How much will the revenue in movies decline next year? When is the next “original” film on their schedule?", "(Others have noted that Disney is very heavy on content this year. For example, why launch The Lion King and Aladdin this year, and not hold until next year.", "My sneaking suspicion is that the cash flow considerations of the streaming platform losses meant they went heavy on a year that already had the Avengers and Star Wars pseudo-finales.", "Still, any insights on the plans for the next few years will be key. They’ve run through most of the sure-fire live-action films (Aladdin, Beauty and the Beast, Lions King) so when will new animated films (that don’t have a number after their name) come up to replenish the IP pipepline?)", "- How has the bankruptcy of Toys'R'Us impacted non-holiday shopping?", "(We may not get this answer since Disney now bundles “parks with products” now, but I worry that the bankruptcy will continue to have ramifications on Disney’s products, which we won’t see in the financials.", "directly.

What about the first summer with tiered pricing?", "(This has long been the golden goose that nets Disney an extra few billions in earnings on top of the streaming revenue.", "Yet, the initial stories are that Disney is under their projections for Disneyland attendance. Using the theme parks to fund the initial streaming losses is a key tradeoff, and they just spent a billion a piece (at least) on these two expansions.", "Potentially, though, the price increases--Disney launched surge pricing this year--may have more to do with the attendance drop.", "Meaning peak travelers now pay $20 more for peak days than regular days (up to $149). This, however, could still be brilliant pricing strategy, as long as the attendance drops less than the 15.5% price increase.)"]}

spending roughly the same amount of time each day on social media today as they did this time last year.", "However, GWI data does show that the daily average has increased by more than half an hour over the past 5 years.", "The typical user now spends 2 hours and 25 minutes on social media each day, equating to roughly one full waking day of their life each week.", "Added together, the world’s social media users will spend a total of 3.7 trillion hours on social media in 2021 – equivalent to more than 420 million years of combined human existence.", "As we’ve seen in previous years though, there are significant differences between countries.", "Filipinos are still the world’s biggest consumers of social media, spending an average of 4 hours and 15 minutes per day using social platforms – a full half an hour more than second-placed Colombians.", "At the other end of the scale, users in Japan say they spend less than an hour a day on social media, although this year’s figure of 51 minutes is still 13 percent higher than Japanese users reported spending on social channels this time last year.", "The latest data from GSMA Intelligence shows that two-thirds of the world’s total population uses a mobile phone today.", "This figure has remained steady for the past few years, but that’s perhaps not surprising when we consider that the world’s 5.2 billion mobile users equate to more than 85 percent of all the people on Earth aged 13 and above.", "But mobile’s dominance isn’t just about user numbers; it’s also about time spent, and how that compares to other devices.", "Data from App Annie shows that Android users around the world now spend more than 4 hours each day using their phones.", "In total, that means Android users spent more than 3.5 trillion cumulative hours using their phones over the past 12 months.", "And perhaps more tellingly, App Annie’s flagship State of Mobile 2021 report also reveals that mobiles now account for a greater amount of people’s time than live TV.", "This is the case even in the United States, where the average American now spends more than 4 hours per day using their mobile phone, compared to roughly 3¾ hours each day watching live TV.", "GWI reports similar findings, with the company’s latest research finding that a typical global internet user now spends 3 hours and 39 minutes each day using the internet on their mobile phone.", "This compares to a total of 3 hours and 24 minutes per day watching television, but it’s worth noting that people are increasingly watching “TV” content via streaming apps on their mobile devices too.", "However, mobile devices only account for about half of our daily internet time.", "In total, the average internet user now spends almost 7 hours per day using the internet across all devices, equating to more than 48 hours per week online – that’s a full two days out of a seven-day week.", "Assuming that the average person sleeps for between 7 and 8 hours per day, this means that we now spend roughly 42 percent of our waking lives online, and that we spend almost as much time using the internet as we do sleeping.", "The figures also show that people are spending more time online each day than they did in previous years.", "The latest findings from GWI show that the typical internet user spent 16 minutes longer online each day in Q3 2020 than they did in Q3 2019, representing a year-on-year increase of 4 percent.", "If these rates continue throughout 2021, the world’s internet users will spend almost 12 trillion hours online this year, which translates to more than 1.3 billion years of combined human time.", "However, as we saw in last year’s report, there’s significant variation in the amount of time that people in different countries spend online.", "Filipinos report spending the greatest amount of time online, at an average of almost 11 hours per day.", "Brazilians, Colombians, and South Africans also say they spend an average of more than 10 hours per day online.", "At the other end of the scale, the Japanese report spending the least amount of time online, at less than 4½ hours per day.", "Interestingly, the figure for China also falls at the lower end of the spectrum, at just 5 hours and 22 minutes per day – 1½ hours less than the global average of 6 hours and 54 minutes.", "Mobile phones now account for roughly 53 percent of the time the world spends online, but the data clearly shows that other devices still play important roles in our connected lives.", "9 in 10 internet users say they go online via a smartphone, but two-thirds also say that they use a laptop or desktop computer to access the internet.", "However, once again, things vary considerably by country.", "Mobiles are now the most widely used internet device in all countries, but the gap between mobiles and computers is often quite small, especially in Western Europe.", "For example, 46 percent of Belgium’s internet users say that computers are their primary internet devices, compared to 49 percent for phones, and 5 percent for tablets.", "Japan also sees relatively high computer use, with more than 4 in 10 internet users saying they prefer to go online via a laptop or desktop device.", "The stage of a country’s economic development plays a role in shaping these ratios, but the median age of the population is also a critical driver.", "As GWI reports, Baby Boomers are more likely to go online via computers and tablets than via phones, with mobile devices accounting for less than 50 percent of total internet time amongst users aged 45 and above.", "Meanwhile, the latest data from StatCounter shows that computers still account for a meaningful share of the world’s web activity.", "More than 40 percent of web pages served in December 2020 were requested by web browsers running on laptop and desktop devices, although the overall share of these devices is down slightly compared to December 2019.", "The relative importance of different devices also varies considerably between countries.", "StatCounter’s data shows that mobile phones account for more than 8 in 10 pages served to web browsers in Nigeria, but that figure drops to barely a quarter of web pages served to browsers in Russia.", "It’s worth highlighting that web browsing only accounts for a small share of overall mobile time, with people spending far more time using mobile apps.", "The latest data from App Annie reveals that native apps account for 92 percent of the time that the world’s Android users spend on their phones, while just 8 percent of that time is spent using mobile web browsers.", "One simple takeaway is that mobile is clearly an essential part of the mix, but we certainly can’t ignore other devices – especially in Western markets, or when we’re hoping to engage older audiences.", "Finding information is the main reason why people go online, with almost two-thirds of the world’s internet users saying this is one of their top motivations.", "However, the latest research from GWI shows that the world’s search behaviours are evolving, and their changing behaviour has important consequences for anyone hoping to engage a digital audience.", "Conventional search engines are still an essential part of the mix of course, with a massive 98 percent of respondents saying that they use a search engine every month.", "However, more than 7 in 10 respondents also say that they now use at least one tool other than text-based search engines to find information online each month.", "Voice interfaces are the most popular alternative to text-based search engines, with 45 percent of global internet users saying that they used voice search or voice commands in the past 30 days.", "It’s important to stress that digital assistants on mobile phones, such as Siri and Google Assistant, account for the majority of this voice activity.", "Smart speakers represent an exciting opportunity, but barely 1 in 12 internet users around the world owns one of these devices today, so their potential is still limited outside of North America and Europe.", "Almost a third of the world’s internet users also use image recognition tools on their mobiles each month, with tools such as Pinterest Lens and Google Lens seeing particularly strong adoption across Latin America and Southeast Asia.", "Young women are the most likely to use an image as their search query, with GWI’s research showing that 4 in 10 female internet users aged 16 to 64 have used one of these tools in the past month.", "These tools represent a particularly interesting opportunity for ecommerce brands, especially those in highly aesthetic categories like fashion, beauty, and home furnishing – and even consumer electronics.", "However, it’s easy to see how image recognition technology could also augment other internet-powered tools.", "For example, a curious diner might access a restaurant’s reviews by snapping a picture of the storefront while they’re standing outside, and using that photo as a search query.", "Perhaps the most interesting trend in evolving search behaviours is the rise of social search.", "Roughly 45 percent of global internet users say that they turn to social networks at least once per month when looking for information about products or services that they’re thinking of buying.", "However, that figure is considerably higher amongst younger age groups.", "Indeed, Gen Z internet users are now more likely to start their brand research on social networks than they are to turn to a search engine, and trends suggest that this will soon be the case for younger Millennials too.", "Digging a bit deeper into online search activities, this year’s reports reveal that people are more likely to research “how to do things” on the internet than they are to look for information about specific brands, products, or services.", "This finding has particular salience for marketers, because it offers valuable insights into the best ways to engage an audience.", "For example, rather than merely telling people that your brand is the ideal solution for a particular problem, a ‘how-to’ video may be a more effective way of capturing their attention.", "Teaching people how to get the best out of your products and services is a great way to add mutual value, improve satisfaction, and potentially boost contextual relevance and recall.", "People are actively asking for this kind of content, too.", "Research from GWI that we covered back in our Digital 2020 April Global Statshot Report found that people were actively seeking out more ‘how-to’ videos and tutorial content during COVID-19 lockdowns.", "And while these findings may have been asked in the specific context of coping with the impact of coronavirus movement restrictions, the ongoing ‘motivations’ data that you’ll find on slide 48 of our Digital 2021 Global Overview Report confirm the enduring appeal of this kind of content.", "Another interesting trend we’ve spotted in this year’s search data provides evidence of the rise of content collaboration, as well as third-party mashups and remixes.", "For context, this trend has been particularly evident in the recent ‘Wellerman’ meme, where people across the world have joined forces for duets of popular sea shanties.", "Already hugely popular on TikTok, these videos have found their way across to YouTube too, often in the form of curated collections or remixes of content that was originally published to TikTok.", "However, data from Google Trends suggests that this kind of content ‘porting’ isn’t an entirely new phenomenon.", "If we were to consider ‘Tik Tok’ and ‘TikTok’ (one query with a space, one without) as being essentially the same search, TikTok would have been the third most popular search term on YouTube across the whole of 2020.", "This latest ranking of YouTube queries also highlights the importance of music to the world’s second largest social platform.", "In 2020, 13 of the 20 most popular search terms on YouTube related specifically to music, with 8 of those including some version of the word “song” (including equivalents in non-English languages).", "Internet users’ enthusiasm for music isn’t restricted to YouTube either.", "Google Trends’ ranking of the 20 most common search queries on Google throughout 2020 also features ‘MP3’ in fifteenth place, highlighting the enduring appeal of music downloads despite the rising popularity of music streaming.", "Music streaming is a clear winner too though, with App Annie’s State of Mobile 2021 report revealing that Spotify was the ninth most-used mobile app around the world in 2020.", "And while many musicians may have a different perspective, it’s clear that there’s money to be made in online music too, with Sirius XM’s Pandora ranking 10th in App Annie’s list of the top 10 mobile apps by consumer spend in 2020.", "New data from Ookla shows that internet connection speeds accelerated rapidly over the past year, with average mobile speeds increasing by almost 50 percent compared to this time last year.", "Around the world, the average mobile data connection now offers download speeds of more than 47 megabits per second, which is more than 15 megabits per second faster than the average we reported in our Digital 2020 report.", "The year-on-year pace of change for mobile connections accelerated by roughly 70 percent compared to last year’s figures, indicating that 5G is already delivering tangible benefits for the world’s mobile internet users.", "GSMA Intelligence reports that more than 4 in 5 mobile users around the world now have a connection which is capable of delivering ‘broadband’ data speeds, although not all of these connections will include a data subscription.", "The number of connections identified as “3G or above” grew by roughly 8 percent over the past year, although – once again – the figures vary considerably by geography.", "Perhaps surprisingly, North Korea is one of just 4 countries where all mobile connections are 3G or above.", "At the other end of the scale, there are now just 6 countries where fewer than 20 percent of mobile connections are capable of delivering broadband data speeds.", "There’s a big difference between 3G and 5G though, and the countries that have already activated 5G networks are already seeing significant benefits in terms of mobile data speeds.", "For example, 5G is now readily available on some mobile networks in Qatar, China, and Kuwait, and all 3 of these countries have seen average mobile internet connection speeds more than double over the past 12 months.", "The increased bandwidth available on 5G networks is also starting to make a tangible difference in the continued growth in global mobile data consumption.", "Ericsson reports that the world now consumes roughly 55 billion gigabytes of mobile data each month, with each smartphone device consuming an average of 9.4GB of data per month.", "The company reports that 5G currently accounts for around 4 percent of total mobile data traffic, but forecasts that this will jump to more than 10 percent this year, and more than half of all mobile traffic by 2026.", "These figures all point to the rapidly growing influence of 5G networks on the world’s mobile landscape.", "For a start, faster connections mean that people should be able to enjoy richer content experiences while on the go.", "The average mobile connection is now fast enough to enable users to stream 4K video without any disruption, although given the size of most mobile phone screens, this may not deliver substantial benefits to the average mobile viewer compared to streaming in 1080p.", "However, 5G should bring more tangible benefits to mobile gamers, because 5G is designed to deliver significantly reduced latency.", "This metric is particularly relevant to ‘shooter’ games – the world’s most popular video game format – because connection latency determines how quickly people can see and react to on-screen action.", "Ookla’s latest data shows that average latency across the world’s mobile connections has decreased from 41ms to 36ms over the past year, although the latest mobile figure is still 70 percent slower than the average fixed internet connection.", "However, 5G connections will enable video game companies to offer more compelling mobile-oriented gaming titles in genres where latency is an important consideration, which may significantly increase the appeal of these games across geographies that currently struggle with slower connections.", "This is particularly pertinent in the developing world, where fixed internet infrastructure is often unavailable, and where it does exist, mobile connection speeds are often faster anyway.", "But this is also true in some of the world’s highly developed economies.", "For example, average mobile connection speeds in Australia, the UAE, and Saudi Arabia all outpace the average speed of each country’s fixed internet connections.", "The greater bandwidth offered by 5G should also improve options for people who want to broadcast their own livestreams.", "This has particular relevance to mobile esports and mobile game live-streaming, which depend on fast, stable connections for the best experience.", "Beyond gaming, improved mobile upload speeds will also enable a greater number of people to get involved in live commerce, empowering a new wave of mobile entrepreneurs to sell their wares in real-time via live-stream promotions.", "So, if you’re wondering how 5G might impact your marketing, my tip would be to think beyond current marketing activities, and ask yourself whether now might be a good time to start exploring mobile gaming or live-stream commerce opportunities for your brand.", "One of the most interesting takeaways from the rankings of the world’s top websites in this year’s reports is that a large amount of social media activity still takes place within mobile browsers.", "For example, Semrush reports that Facebook still attracts 1.8 billion unique visitors to its website each month, which equates to roughly two-thirds of its monthly active user base.", "Facebook’s own data suggest that most of these users will be using the company’s native mobile apps more frequently than they visit the web interface, but it’s still interesting to see that the website continues to play an important role.", "However, the figures for some other social platforms are perhaps more surprising.", "For example, WhatsApp and Instagram also attract huge volumes of traffic to their web presences, despite being clearly positioned as ‘app-first’ experiences.", "Semrush also reports that Instagram’s website saw more than 830 million unique visitors in December, while WhatsApp.com attracted 276 million uniques.", "Even TikTok – with its considerable Gen Z skew – attracted almost 200 million visits to its website in December 2020.", "Data from SimilarWeb echoes these findings, with the company reporting even higher unique visitor numbers than Semrush for some of these platforms.", "One hypothesis is that this web traffic is the result of ‘off-platform’ sharing, such as when someone sends a link to an Instagram post via a messenger app like Telegram.", "Meanwhile, when it comes to services like WhatsApp, we might conclude that considerable numbers of people are chatting via the platform’s web interface.", "These findings may not have immediate implications for brands’ advertising activities, but they do offer interesting insights into how the world uses the internet, and in particular, how people’s journeys across different digital platforms take shape.", "A more strategic approach to social media marketing", "In-depth analysis of data collected by GWI shows that at least 98 percent of the users of any given social media platform use at least one other social platform.", "The audiences of individual social platforms are also subject to significant overlaps, with 85 percent of TikTok users aged 16 to 64 saying they use Facebook, and almost 95 percent of Instagram users saying they also use YouTube.", "The extent of these audience overlaps has particular relevance to marketers, who often spend significant amounts of time debating which platforms to use for their activities.", "The key takeaway here is that brands do not need to be active on every single platform, and in fact the data show that a presence on just one or two of the larger platforms offers the potential to reach almost all of the world’s social media users.", "For context, at least 6 platforms now have more than 1 billion monthly active users, while at least 17 have more than 300 million.", "However, this doesn’t mean that marketers should focus solely on these larger platforms.", "Indeed, the data support the argument for a more strategic, portfolio approach to social media.", "Rather than focusing all of their attention on reach, marketers can now explore other factors, such as the specific creative opportunities offered by each platform’s content formats, or the different engagement opportunities available on more ‘niche’ platforms.", "And the good news is that – if we look beyond reach – we have plenty of options to choose from, even when it comes to social media.", "GWI’s data shows that the typical global user now has a presence on more than 8 different social channels, although the data also indicate that people use these channels with varying frequency and different levels of engagement.", "However, it’s very unlikely that people use each of their 8.4 different platforms for exactly the same purpose.", "GWI’s data clearly show that people use social platforms for a variety of different reasons, and these underlying motivations offer a far better basis for planning than reach figures alone.", "So, next time you’re planning a campaign, look beyond platform user numbers, and ask yourself:", "Which platform(s) will be most relevant to their motivations?", "How can I use these channels to achieve my desired outcomes?", "As we’ll see in the next sections though, people’s motivations and platform choices also vary meaningfully by location and by demographic, so be sure to dig into our latest local country reports for richer insights into your specific audience’s behaviours.", "The internet may seem like a truly global environment, but the data in this year’s reports clearly show that people’s behaviours and preferences vary considerably between geographies.", "Furthermore, while many platforms are popular amongst users all over the world, the ways in which people use those platforms often differ meaningfully between geographies.", "For these reasons, marketers need to invest time to understand the nuances of their specific audiences.", "In particular, global marketers need to go beyond the headlines reported in Western media, because trends in these countries are only representative of a small fraction of global digital audiences.", "For context, the United States accounts for fewer than 1 in 15 (6.4 percent) of the world’s internet users.", "Users across the whole of the EU and the UK account for less than 10 percent of the global total, while internet users across all of the world’s 60-plus ‘highly developed’ economies account for less than one-third of the world’s total connected population.", "And just in case you’re thinking that developed economies account for the majority of the world’s spending, Statista reports that China – which doesn’t feature in that list of ‘developed’ economies – now accounts for almost half (46 percent) of the world’s total consumer ecommerce spending.", "The first step is to pay closer attention to what’s happening at a local level.", "You’ll find all of our latest reports for every single country in the world – completely for free – in the DataReportal library.", "I’d also recommend going beyond headlines to identify the corresponding audience for each “juicy stat”.", "Don’t assume that reports of a meteoric rise in the users of a new social platform have any bearing on your audience in your country.", "It’s always better to invest time to find out which channels your audience prefers, and what they use each platform for.", "In many cases, you may find that digital platforms that haven’t made the news for years in your home country are still the dominant choice in another market.", "A good example of this is Yahoo!, which remains one of the top destinations for audiences in Japan.", "However, it’s also important to look beyond your bubble – especially if you want to identify emerging trends that may shape your audience’s future behaviour.", "Various trends suggest that the ‘next big trend’ in digital won’t emerge from a Western market.", "For example, as we saw above, the connected behaviours of people across Asia and Latin America are already reshaping online search.", "Similarly, the popularity of live-streaming has revolutionised online shopping in China, where the ‘live commerce’ market is now worth around US$60 billion a year.", "The live-stream shopping format has become so popular in China that just one influencer – Viya – sold more than US$4.5 billion through her Taobao live-stream channel last year.", "For context, reports suggest that this equates to roughly the same amount that supermarket chain Carrefour sold across all its stores in China in the same period.", "However, data shows that the popularity of live commerce isn’t just a Chinese phenomenon, with the format also picking up momentum across Southeast Asia and India.", "What’s more, these three regions – China, Southern Asia, and Southeastern Asia – account for more than half of today’s global internet user base, so this is an opportunity that marketers around the world will want to tap into, even if live-stream shopping hasn’t taken off in their home market yet.", "Developing nations are also leading the way when it comes to innovations in digital finance.", "For example, the latest data from GWI shows that internet users across Africa, Latin America, and Southeast Asia are far more likely to own cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, compared to their peers in Europe and North America.", "However, the impact of these trends isn’t restricted to the developing world; they also have real significance for marketers in the West.", "With many developed nations already seeing internet adoption rates in excess of 90 percent, big internet companies from the US and China know that they need to look to emerging markets to secure the next wave of growth.", "To ensure the best possible chances of success, these companies also know that they’ll need to tailor their products and services to the needs, behaviours, and preferences of these new audiences.", "However, economies of scale are a critical consideration for big internet companies, which means that they’re unlikely to develop significantly different products for each region or local market.", "As a result, we can expect to see the influence of trends and developments in developing markets appear in Western platforms too, potentially resulting in changes in behaviour across developed economies as well.", "We’ve included a wealth of new charts in this year’s reports that offer insights into connected activities by age and gender.", "One of the most revealing of these charts shows how adoption of ecommerce varies by demographic.", "And the clear takeaway from this GWI data is that internet users in the Baby Boomer generation are only marginally less likely to use ecommerce than Gen Z and Millennial internet users.", "Moreover, female internet users aged 55 to 64 are actually more likely to shop online than male internet users aged 16 to 24.", "It’s important to stress that these figures only reflect people’s behaviours once they start using the internet; the data doesn’t show ecommerce penetration against the broader population.", "Nevertheless, these findings clearly show the near universal appeal of ecommerce amongst internet users, regardless of their age or gender.", "And the obvious takeaway here is that online shopping represents a large and compelling opportunity for almost all consumer brands, regardless of category or target audience.", "However, there are some important differences in how people of different ages go about their online shopping.", "GWI’s data show that younger generations are considerably more likely to use a mobile phone to make online purchases, but these figures tail off quite quickly amongst their parents’ generation.", "Conversely, Baby Boomers are considerably more likely to buy things online via a laptop or desktop computer.", "Nearly twice as many internet users aged 55 to 64 say they bought something via a computer in the past month compared to internet users aged 16 to 24.", "However, these figures relate solely to checkout, and there’s a high likelihood that older generations will still be using mobile devices to inform the rest of their ‘buyer journey’.", "For example, while it’s not mobile-specific, data from GWI shows that older age groups are the most likely to research products online before making a purchase.", "More than 6 in 10 male internet users over the age of 45 say that they go online to look for information about products and services that they’re thinking of buying, compared to just 51 percent of men aged 16 to 24.", "It’s also interesting to note that a significant share of older internet users play video games.", "Perhaps unsurprisingly, gaming adoption rates amongst older generations aren’t as high as they are for Gen Z, where more than 90 percent of internet users say they play games.", "However, GWI’s data still shows that more than two-thirds of internet users aged 55 to 64 around the world play video games.", "But once again, there are plenty of differences lurking beneath the surface of these headline findings.", "For example, as we saw in the earlier section on internet connection speeds, older gamers have different preferences when it comes to the kinds of games they play, with ‘puzzle’ formats particularly popular amongst Baby Boomers.", "Another age-related trend is evident in our latest social media data, which shows that older age groups are the fastest-growing segments of many platforms’ audiences.", "For example, Facebook saw users over the age of 65 increase by roughly 25 percent over the past year – that’s almost double the average across all age groups of 13 percent since this time last year.", "Meanwhile, users over the age of 50 also represent Snapchat’s fastest-growing audience segment.", "The number of users aged 50 and above that advertisers can reach on Snapchat has grown by roughly 25 percent in the past 3 months, with male users in this age group increasing by a third.", "Note that these Snapchat figures represent quarterly growth, while the Facebook figures above showcase annual growth.", "It’s also worth noting that these figures represent relative growth, not the absolute increase in user numbers.", "Older age groups typically account for a smaller percentage of overall social media users than younger demographics, so it’s perhaps ‘easier’ for older age groups to record faster growth.", "For context, users aged 25 to 34 still accounted for the greatest number of new Facebook users over the past year, even though they were already the platform’s largest demographic segment.", "However, these relative growth figures still show that a greater number of older users are joining social platforms.", "These evolving demographics may bring new opportunities for marketers, together with new revenue streams for platforms and publishers.", "One of the standout digital stories in 2020 was the rise of ecommerce, with the COVID-19 pandemic driving consumers all over the world to embrace online shopping.", "With GWI data showing that most internet users already made online purchases even before the pandemic, there wasn’t much scope for an overall increase in ecommerce adoption rates amongst internet users.", "However, GWI data still shows that ecommerce adoption rates increased by 3.3 percentage points between Q2 and Q3 2020, representing quarterly growth of more than 4½ percent.", "At a global level, nearly 77 percent of internet users aged 16 to 64 say they buy something online each month.", "Internet users in Indonesia are the most likely to make ecommerce purchases, with more than 87 percent of the country’s respondents to GWI’s survey saying they bought something online in the past month.", "At the other end of the scale, just 57 percent of internet users in Egypt say they made an online purchase in the past 30 days.", "The ecommerce adoption rate is also relatively low in Russia, where just 60 percent of internet users say they bought something via the internet in the past month.", "As we saw in the previous section, there isn’t a significant difference in ecommerce adoption rates by age and gender, at least at a global level.", "However, a more interesting story lies in what people have been buying over recent months.", "Before we dig into the numbers, it’s worth pointing out that different sources report quite different findings for ecommerce activity, so data points on some slides may appear to contradict similar data points on other charts.", "These differences don’t represent an error; rather, they illustrate that different metrics may tell a different story about what people have been doing across different parts of the internet.", "Statista reports that the Fashion and Beauty category accounted for the largest share of global B2C ecommerce revenues in 2020, at more than US$665 billion.", "This is the first time in our ongoing series of Global Digital Reports that the Travel category hasn’t come out top, highlighting just how difficult recent months have been for travel and tourism brands.", "Indeed, Statista reports that online revenues in the Travel, Mobility and Accommodation category were down by more than 50 percent year-on-year, resulting in a drop of well over half a trillion US dollars in annual consumer spending.", "On the other hand, many other categories saw strong growth in ecommerce revenues in 2020.", "Food & Personal Care was the fastest growing category, with COVID-19 lockdowns and social distancing measures acting as a catalyst for significant increases in online grocery shopping.", "Worldwide, the category saw annual revenues in excess of US $400 billion in 2020, up by more than 40 percent compared to the previous year.", "Data from Contentsquare also offers good news for online grocery brands, with traffic to supermarkets’ ecommerce properties 35 percent higher in December than it was in January.", "People haven’t just been visiting online grocery stores either; Contentsquare’s data shows that supermarkets’ online transactions were more than double their January 2020 levels in both November and December 2020.", "These numbers support findings that we shared in our Digital 2020 July Global Statshot Report, when we reported that significant numbers of internet users had been saying they intended to continue with new online shopping behaviours that they’d adopted during the first wave of COVID-19 lockdowns.", "Moreover, these numbers don’t just offer good news for supermarkets.", "Grocery shopping tends to be a high-frequency activity, which means that people have had the chance to develop new habits over recent months.", "As most marketers know, it can be very difficult to inspire behaviour change – especially in high-frequency activities – so the new shopping habits of recent months present an unparalleled opportunity for brands and retailers to challenge the status quo.", "And what’s more, we’re already seeing evidence that people’s habits have changed in other categories too.", "Online cosmetics purchases soared during the recent year-end holiday season, with shoppers around the world making more than 3½ times as many online category purchases in November 2020 as they did in January 2020.", "Some of this variance can likely be attributed to the category’s normal seasonality, but such a dramatic jump between January and December suggests that a significant number of purchases that people might previously have made in physical stores have now shifted online.", "This echoes findings from Adobe, who reported that:", "“…it would’ve taken between 4 and 6 years to get to the levels that we saw in May 2020 if growth had continued at the same levels [we’d seen] for the past few years.”", "Furthermore, it’s now highly unlikely that people’s shopping behaviours will return to pre-pandemic patterns once daily life returns to some semblance of normality.", "While we can expect to see people return to physical stores once health concerns ease, many people will likely continue to conduct a greater share of their shopping activities online

across every step of the buyer journey into online channels, meaning that marketers may need to rethink every aspect of their activities – not just “last-mile” demand generation.", "Google dominates global digital – but a bit less than before", "It might not come as a surprise to learn that Google dominates almost every aspect of digital, but it’s still interesting to quantify the company’s position.", "More than 7 in 10 mobile handsets in use around the world today use the Android operating system, according to the latest web traffic data from Statcounter.", "Facebook’s data puts Android’s share even higher, with the company’s Insights tools indicating that more than 8 in 10 mobile Facebook users aged 18-plus access via an Android-powered device.", "Google’s position in the search market is stronger yet, with Statcounter’s latest data indicating that the platform enjoys more than 90 percent share of the global search market.", "Chrome is also the world’s favourite web

than 23 hours per month using the YouTube app on Android phones, equating to almost one full day using the platform’s app each month.", "However, Google’s own data reveals that mobile phones only

Chrome browsers support third-party cookies, which Apple’s Safari browsers already block by default.", "Many advertisers have relied on these cookies to power their targeting and reporting activities, so this change may have significant implications for many of the world’s digital marketers.", "In the short term, this change may result in greater reliance on “walled garden” platforms such as Facebook and Amazon, because their on-platform technologies don’t rely on third-party cookies.", "However, almost all programmatic advertising companies will need to reinvent their models for a world without third-party cookies, so we may see a wave of new innovations in the ad tech industry over the coming months.", "For many white collar workers around the world, 2020 was the year of working from home, or “WFH” as it became commonly known.", "WFH looks like it will remain an enforced part of many people’s working lives for the foreseeable future too, with many countries still in the throes of high COVID-19 infection rates at the start of 2021.", "Moreover, many people may choose to continue with more flexible working practises even after the pandemic passes, and many employers may actively encourage such flexibility too.", "Evolving workplace dynamics have already inspired many changes in the world’s professional digital behaviours, from the rise of video conferencing to a greater reliance on software that helps teams manage remote workers.", "However, I expect to see further innovation in products and services designed to help with remote working over the coming months, especially in the areas of communication and ‘team cohesion’.", "Telemedicine was already a hot topic in healthcare prior to the outbreak of COVID, but the coronavirus crisis of 2020 has accelerated the industry’s advance in much the same way that it accelerated people’s move to online shopping.", "Doctors around the world are now offering ‘remote’ consultations, with many turning to video conferencing platforms and even messenger apps to deliver diagnoses and advice for their patients.", "Digital solutions designed to help with wellness and wellbeing have also seen significant growth in recent months, and trends suggest that this will continue to be one of the hottest areas of growth in 2021 too.", "The ever-fluctuating price of Bitcoin continues to grab media headlines around the world, but it’s clear that ‘DeFi’ – decentralised finance – has started to gain more mainstream acceptance.", "For context, it’s notoriously difficult to change people’s financial behaviours, with a popular industry axiom proclaiming that people are more likely to change their spouse than change their bank.", "However, data shows that increasing numbers of people are now turning to ‘alternative’ financial solutions, especially for products like insurance.", "Meanwhile, mobile payment platforms and ewallets are changing the ways in which people pay for things.", "This is most clearly evident online, with Worldpay reporting that ewallets accounted for the greatest share of online purchases around the world in 2019, with almost twice as much share as credit cards.", "But with many retailers and shoppers prioritising contactless payment methods in recent months due to COVID-19-related health concerns, mobile payment services such as Apple Pay and Google Pay have come to the fore in physical retail too.", "I don’t foresee an ‘overnight revolution’ in consumer finance this year, but I do expect to see an acceleration in people’s adoption and use of more digital products and services in the financial services sector.", "More than 1 billion people around the world faced some kind of disruption to their education in 2020 due to COVID-19, so we can expect increased emphasis on digital innovation in the world of learning over the coming months too.", "Some of this will relate to how individual educators deliver their materials, with innovations in ‘digital classroom’ solutions likely to continue apace in 2021.", "I’d expect to see some important changes in government policy too, with lawmakers all over the world addressing the societal imperatives and potential opportunities associated with enhanced online learning.", "These innovations will likely extend to the corporate world too, with remote training and ‘upskilling’ remaining one of the hottest topics for HR professionals in 2021", "And given the importance of education, we might expect to see digital giants like Google and Facebook become more actively involved in this field too, potentially even collaborating to deliver much needed support to governments and educators around the globe.", "With digital privacy once again making headlines at the start of 2021 thanks to another furore surrounding platforms’ terms and conditions, 2021 may be the year when ‘portable digital identities’ start to gain more mainstream traction.", "People everywhere are increasingly aware of – and concerned about – how much of their ‘data’ they share, whether knowingly or not.", "As a result, platforms and publishers may start to accept decentralised sign-on solutions, such as those offered by Inrupt.", "Large internet companies will likely resist these third-party solutions due to the inevitable financial consequences, but if a sufficient number of users choose privacy

Despite the sheer number of data scientists and (frightening) level of behavioral targeting used by Google and Facebook, Pay TV has held on to an impressive level of ad spend at about $70 billion in 2019 compared to $87 billion on mobile.", "One reason is that advertising on the television is more effective – no amount of data collection can change the video completion rate achieved when you're sitting in your living room.", "Although these budgets have not migrated to mobile or desktop in the past, those advertisers now have an opportunity to use data to personalize the advertising while viewers are in their living rooms.", "Roku and AVOD are the best of both worlds – combining data for targeting and high completion and viewability rates — and this creates a unique market from SVOD.", "For reference, completion rates on Connected TV ads are as high as 97% with 100% viewability, according to a study by Benchmark.", "Below, I review Netflix's earnings as it's essential to keep an eye on exactly how long a winner can run in the OTT media category.", "I also review Roku's upcoming earnings and what to look for.", "Netflix surpassed expectations again in Q4 despite many believing the increase in Disney Plus subscribers and HBO Max would weigh on Netflix's subscriber results.", "To be fair, the real test is yet to come as dining out, travel, and return-to-work patterns begin to normalize.", "Netflix is guiding conservatively for Q1 with 6 million net additions.", "Revenue grew 21% YoY to $6.6B, topping consensus estimates by $20M. Net adds of 8.5M came in well ahead of expectations calling for 6M. Netflix now expects 2021 free-cash-flow to be “around break-even” versus previous guidance of -$1B. The company also intends to explore a share repurchase program moving forward:", "“Combined with our $8.2B cash balance and our $750M undrawn credit facility, we believe we no longer have a need to raise external financing for our day-to-day operations…As we generate excess cash, we intend to maintain $10B-15B in gross debt and will explore returning cash to shareholders through ongoing stock buybacks, as we did in the past (2007-2011).\"", "Competition has been one of Wall Street's primary concerns regarding Netflix. In Q4, Netflix maintained a healthy lead over the competition with 29% market share.", "In Q4 2019, Netflix had 31% share of the streaming market. Keep in mind, the market is growing overall so a smaller percentage can still represent subscriber and revenue growth.", "Despite the modest decline in the share of minutes watched, it is evident that competition did not bite into Netflix’s net adds in 2020.", "This supports the thesis that other streaming services, namely Disney+, are complementary to Netflix.", "Netflix just completed its best year in history while Disney+ and other new streaming services became available.", "Consumer behavior is showing that consumers prefer to have multiple subscription services.", "In Q4, Netflix had 57.2M global app downloads versus 53.5M for Disney+. In Q4 '18 and '19, Netflix had 53M and 58M global app downloads, respectively.", "These numbers indicate that the success of Disney+ is not coming at the expense of Netflix. Instead, Disney+ is a complimentary service helping to further the acceleration of streaming to the TV.", "Streaming to the TV gained significant market share versus all other TV usage during the pandemic.", "Streaming to the TV now owns over a 20% share of the market.

Therefore, the cord-cutting trend is secondary for Roku, whereas Pay TV ad budgets' migration is the primary trend.", "There are other reasons that I like Roku, such as owning the whole stack including the operating system, the management, it’s global opportunity, the agnosticism, etcetera– which I have covered in previous analysis.", "However, I try to keep things simple when discussing my thesis, and the migration of Pay TV ad budgets combined with Roku’s first-party data is why this stock has its best years ahead.", "The information contained herein are opinions and not financial advice.

If demand for “snackable” content remains, even if demand for originals continues to slide slightly, then churn remains low.", "Through a combination of both, Netflix remains steady.", "Netflix reported today a loss of nearly 500,000 subscribers in its US and Canada markets between Q1 and Q2, but the addition of beloved series — including 30 Rock and Friday Night Lights — may give subscribers a reason to return or prevent those thinking of leaving from doing so.", "Netflix released the most original series in the last quarter compared to others, but despite releasing twice as many original series as the next digital competitor, Netflix’s demand share still dropped while Prime Video’s increased.", "The question is what type of content is Netflix looking to license out in order to bring in possible subscribers and keep those who are paying engaged every single week.", "It’s not just about how much is being bought, but what is being bought and why.", "Is it worth it for Netflix to spend hundreds of millions of dollars on a beloved sitcom if it cuts churns rates (already pretty low) even more?", "Or should Netflix pick up a drama that everyone is talking about to hopefully bring those customers in and give them a chance to watch it all in an incredibly simple way?", "There are two points to consider: Netflix is still the most subscribed-to streaming service out of any competition and that means it’s hitting a saturation point faster than others in different countries, especially the United States.", "Local originals and big, whopping new series may help to bring back subscribers who dropped the service for another option, but figuring out licensed series that play around the world is also integral.", "These may be shows that are in high demand and have high supply that streaming services like Netflix can pick and choose from; CBS crime procedurals (Criminal Minds, NCIS), medical procedurals (Grey’s Anatomy), long-running sitcoms (New Girl) or multi-season genre programming (The Walking Dead, The Vampire Diaries).", "Netflix is still relatively new to creating original content; executives haven’t had decades to create thousands of series that a streaming service could lean on to keep people coming back.", "As Netflix continues to invest in its own original series to get to that point, licensing shows that people will return to every night is the bread and butter for engagement in-between new, highly anticipated original series launching.", "A new season of Stranger Things and The Witcher may take a year or more to become available, but having Rick and Morty and Star Trek: Discovery in global territories or The Walking Dead, Shameless, and Grey’s Anatomy in the US fills that spot.", "Splashy new originals bring people in, licensed content keeps them after they’ve marathoned a show, and that continued engagement encourages subscribers to check out new series that Netflix is dropping every week.", "It’s a sellers market. Both conglomerates with massive libraries (ViacomCBS, NBCUniversal, and Disney to name a few) and studios with sought after titles are in a position to license their series on an exclusive, non-exclusive, or hybrid basis for a period of time to content distributors who don’t have the deep library catalogs yet — Netflix, Amazon Prime Video, and Apple TV+, for example.", "In-demand, top series are licensed out for a hefty fee.", "At the same time, trying to license top in-demand series from the biggest conglomerates, and therefore those with the largest libraries, is getting exceptionally more difficult as individual streaming services launch.", "WarnerMedia pays $450 million to have Friends exclusively on its streaming service in the US (Netflix carries it in many regions globally).", "NBCUniversal pays $500 million for The Office in the US (Netflix and Amazon Prime Video carry it in many international markets).", "Disney shifts most content from its top brands exclusively to Disney+ in regions where it’s available.", "Netflix executives have talked about the importance of producing as many originals as possible because of increased competition and aforementioned exclusivity plays.", "For Netflix to continue appeasing subscriber demand, working with suppliers globally to ensure there’s always some form of in-demand content is necessary.", "Licensing deals will continue to happen, with a focus on ensuring those titles are available to as many subscribers as possible globally.", "As long as the percentage of titles across the board show an increase in demand, then churn is reduced.", "Whether this is thanks to originals, thanks to licensed content, or both, the endgame is the same. Often, this is only accomplished through a combination of both; that’s why having the right licensed content at the right time is critical.", "The ratio of originals to licensed content may vary from month to month, but average demand for the entire library has to remain consistently good, ideally outstanding.", "As Netflix continues to build its franchises and try to develop long lasting series, licensed content is still vitally important to satiate subscribers demand, as seen through our data.", "In markets where saturation is finally hitting (like the US), giving customers a reason to open Netflix every day and convincing them not to leave becomes the goal more so than adding a plethora of subscribers every quarter.", "Licensed content helps increase average demand every quarter, and aids in Netflix staying a necessity not becoming an optional monthly subscription"]}

for 2020 was positive, with the exception of Cyprus, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Portugal and Spain where the losses were driven largely by loan loss provisions and other P&L items.[18]", "Based on listed banks’ first quarter earnings releases, the profitability of euro area banks improved significantly reflecting gains from cost-cutting and stronger trading income, but their trailing return on equity remained below pre-pandemic levels on aggregate.", "Euro area bank profitability is anticipated to recover slowly, with models based on market expectations projecting aggregate ROE of 3% at the end of 2021 and 6% in 2022 (see Chart 3.4, right panel).", "These forecasts depend crucially on the path of the overall economic recovery and ultimately on the progress in rolling out vaccines across euro area countries.", "While the time span until interest rates are expected to return to positive territory has shortened recently from 2030 to 2026, this implies that rates will still remain low for a substantial period, thereby putting pressure on banks’ interest income.", "Bank profitability in 2020 was strongly affected by loan loss provisions and is expected to recover only gradually as vaccines are distributed more widely", "Operating profits weakened mainly on the back of lower net interest income, especially towards the end of the year.", "As the economic fallout from the pandemic intensified, banks’ operating profits faced a decline in both net interest income (NII) and net fee and commission income (NFCI).", "While the negative contributions from these two components were offset by cost-cutting and non-core operating profit items in the second and third quarters, the decline in net interest income increased in the fourth quarter and resulted in a lower operating profit for the full year (see Chart 3.5, left panel).", "Going forward, operating profits are expected to recover only slowly and to be supported by additional cost-cutting and higher NFCI.", "NII declined in 2020 by 12% and thereby continued the downward trend that started in 2018. While the volume of interest-earning assets was about 6% larger than in 2019, the margin decline became more pronounced in the second half of 2020 (see Chart 3.5, right panel).", "The pressure on NII is expected to decline only in 2022.", "Trading income supported the profitability of euro area banks with a stronger investment banking focus.", "Higher trading activity in volatile markets especially during the second and fourth quarters helped some euro area banks with a stronger focus on capital market activities to beat analysts’ earnings expectations due to higher revenues in equity and fixed income trading.", "Since capital market activity during 2020 was at levels not seen since 2009, the positive impulse from trading activities might be smaller going forward.", "While some non-euro area investment banks incurred substantial losses on margin calls due to the default of Archegos Capital Management (see Chapter 2), euro area banks were only marginally affected.", "The incident, however, highlights the risks related to the prime brokerage business.", "The decline in banks’ operating income during 2020 was largely driven by margin compression and the recovery in profitability is supported by cost-cutting and NFCI", "Looking ahead, some of the pressures weighing on interest margins in 2020 are expected to ease, notably if yield curves steepen.", "A flattening of the yield curve in early 2020, followed by a reduced pass-through of negative rates to corporate depositors in the second half of 2020, contributed to lower interest margins of euro area banks.", "The larger NII decline for the loan book relative to fixed income securities can be mainly attributed to smaller risk premia on state-guaranteed non-financial corporate (NFC) loans and weaker demand for consumer lending (see Chart 3.6, left panel).", "Looking ahead, forward rates suggest that the yield curve slope has bottomed out and is expected to rise until 2023.", "Against the backdrop of rising inflation and growth expectations since February, the ten-year swap rate expected at the end of 2023 increased by 40 basis points.", "As net interest margins co-move with the slope of the yield curve, the opportunities for banks to generate higher margins from maturity transformation on new lending should hence improve over the next years (see Chart 3.6, right panel).", "But as the existing stock of loans is only repricing gradually, the margin recovery of the entire loan book will take time.", "Interest margins fell markedly in 2020, especially for loans, but income from maturity transformation is expected to improve somewhat in the coming years", "A recovery in lending income relies on the economic rebound improving corporate and consumer confidence, as well as easier lending standards.", "In the second half of 2020 banks tightened lending standards, in particular for corporate loans, as risk perceptions rose and the take-up of guaranteed loans moderated (see Chart 3.7, left panel).", "The tightening was more pronounced for loans to SMEs and for loans with longer maturities. Reflecting the ongoing uncertainties surrounding the development of the pandemic and the speed of the roll-out of vaccines in the euro area, banks expect an additional tightening of credit standards in the first half of 2021.", "As a consequence of reduced corporate loan demand since September 2020 and despite tighter housing credit standards, lending volume was mainly driven by mortgage lending on the back of low interest rates (see Chart 3.7, right panel).", "So far in 2021, average monthly lending flows to the non-financial private sector have exceeded pre-pandemic levels due to higher corporate lending in March.", "This was largely driven by borrowing in Germany which could be related to a robust manufacturing sector and the financing of working capital.", "While industrial confidence has recovered, an improvement in consumer confidence is required for high-margin consumer lending to pick up and thereby support bank profitability going forward.", "Banks tightened lending standards substantially in the second half of the year and since September lending volume has been mainly driven by mortgage loans", "Business disruptions at euro area banks have increased during the pandemic, but losses have remained limited compared with other operational risk events.", "The higher usage of online banking and the increase in remote work during the pandemic have led to losses as a consequence of business disruptions and system failures, but these losses have remained limited relative to other operational risk events.", "A closer look at the affected business lines reveals that the bulk of losses related to business disruptions were attributed to the entire institution, retail banking or trading and sales (see Chart 3.8, left panel).", "While cyber incidents reported by euro area banks have increased during the pandemic, institutions have not been severely impacted so far.", "Cyber incidents reported to the ECB by significant institutions in 2020 have increased compared with the previous year, mainly driven by incidents with a malicious intent.", "Distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks in particular are trending upwards, including ransom DDoS by large threat actors (see Chart 3.8, right panel).", "Losses related to business disruptions and system failures have increased during the pandemic and denial of service attacks are the most frequent type of cyber incident", "Fortunately, these attacks have caused only very limited interruptions mostly due to the unavailability of smaller third parties.", "An upward trend can be observed in the incidents related to third parties due to an increasing reliance of the industry on third-party services.", "No major incidents related to cyber attacks on euro area financial market infrastructures have been reported yet.", "But persistent deficiencies in basic ICT (information and communication technology) hygiene, complex ICT architecture and a growing amount of end-of-life ICT systems in many banks still need to be addressed.", "Some large-scale ICT projects to address these vulnerabilities could be delayed due to the pandemic, but banks may also put off addressing these weaknesses because of the economic outlook and likely lower profitability.", "3.3 Banks’ bond spreads tightened and capital ratios rose", "After declining markedly towards the end of 2020, bond spreads of euro area banks tightened further but at a slower pace.", "For the euro area on aggregate, bank bond spreads declined significantly during November and December, mirroring the equity price rally.", "The increase in the spreads of bank bonds observed in March 2021 (see Chart 3.9, left panel) can be attributed to the increase in government bond yields and was more pronounced for senior bonds such as covered bonds (+10 basis points) and non-preferred senior and holding company debt instruments (+6 basis points).", "As around half of the outstanding bank bonds mature by 2025 and the yields for refinancing these bonds are expected to still remain below those yields agreed at issuance, banks are likely to continue benefiting from favourable market funding costs over the next years (see Chart 3.9, right panel).", "The ECB’s longer-term refinancing operations provide additional funding support for euro area banks.", "Bank bond spreads continued to tighten and market funding costs are expected to decline further as maturing bonds still carry higher yields", "As private issuance has fallen substantially in recent years, banks need to prepare for an eventual return to market funding in the medium term.", "Due to the pandemic, the ECB has provided substantial longer-term funding to banks which led to a significant increase in liquidity buffers during 2020.", "The combined amount of excess reserves and deposit facility holdings has increased since end-2019 by €1.9 trillion (see Chart 3.10, left panel).", "The latest targeted longer-term refinancing operation (TLTRO) auction in March 2021 saw one of the largest take-ups due to its more favourable terms.", "As a consequence, the central bank funding reliance of euro area banks on aggregate has increased strongly and bond issuance volumes of non-G-SIBs have fallen to historical lows, amid some heterogeneity across euro area countries.", "Normalised by banks’ total assets, central bank funding reliance was the highest in Italy and Spain and banks in these two countries out of the four largest euro area economies are also closer to the non-investment-grade rating space (see Chart 3.10, right panel).", "Among other aspects, size also seems to play a role as mid-sized banks, i.e. banks with total assets between €20 billion and €200 billion, exhibit the highest central bank funding reliance.", "To avoid that banks face challenges in a few years when trying to return to market funding, it is essential that they work on resolving some of their balance sheet weaknesses and structural issues, for example by improving cost-efficiency; this is especially the case for some smaller banks, which might face limited market access and might therefore have to progressively rebuild an investor base.", "Euro area banks increased their liquidity buffers significantly during 2020, but the reliance on central bank funding might pose risks for some banks in the medium term", "Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) ratios of euro area banks on aggregate improved in 2020 by around 60 basis points to 15.4%.", "The rise in capital ratios was largely driven by declining average risk weights, which compensated for balance sheet expansion, while the contribution from retained earnings shrank at the end of 2020 (see Chart 3.11, left panel).", "Regulatory changes (i.e. the Capital Requirements Regulation “quick fix”) and prudence on dividends also contributed to higher capital ratios.", "Looking in more detail at the changes in risk-weighted assets during 2020 reveals that market risk increased in the second quarter and to a lesser extent in the fourth quarter on the back of higher trading activity in volatile markets.", "There was a marked decline in corporate credit risk-weighted assets in the third and fourth quarters (see Chart 3.11, right panel), which appears at least partly related to NFC loans granted with state guarantees and to the adjustment of the SME supporting factor.", "The increase in excess liquidity, which is assigned a zero risk weight, also played a major role in the decrease of average risk weights.", "At the country level, CET1 ratios increased in all countries except Estonia, Finland, Greece, Ireland, Luxembourg and Slovenia where balance sheet expansion outweighed the other factors.[19]", "As asset quality indicators suggest that a materialisation of pandemic-related credit risk has started, this is likely to have implications for banks’ capital ratios going forward.", "Banks’ capitalisation levels are well above regulatory minimum requirements and therefore banks have capital space to absorb losses.", "So far, however, it appears that in particular banks with less capital space above regulatory buffers are reluctant to actually use these buffers (see Chapter 5).", "The EU-wide stress-test exercise, the results of which are expected by end-July, aims to provide additional insights into the resilience of the European banking sector to a prolonged COVID-19 scenario in a lower-for-longer interest rate environment.", "The rise in the CET1 ratio was mainly due to an increase of lower-risk assets amid an expansion of state-guaranteed loans to euro area corporates", "Euro area bank equity prices have benefited from a broader market rally since November. The approval of vaccines against the coronavirus in late 2020 boosted hopes for a stronger global economic recovery and triggered a rotation out of growth stocks into value stocks (see Chapter 2).", "Against this backdrop and despite unchanged bank profitability projections for 2021 and 2022, bank stock prices rose by 40% in November alone.", "In February, the announcement of US fiscal stimulus and a pick-up in US inflation expectations spilled over to the euro area and lifted bank shares by another 25% (see Chart 3.12, left panel).", "But considered over a longer horizon, euro area bank stock prices have strongly underperformed the euro area broader market and banks in the United States.", "While there were rallies of euro area bank stock prices also in 2012 and 2017, the longer-term relative unattractiveness of the sector is rooted in structural issues, such as cost inefficiencies, which are in turn reflected in lower profitability.", "In the fourth quarter of 2020, 7% of euro area listed banks reported an ROE above 10%, compared with 49% of banks in the United States (see Chart 3.12, right panel).", "Addressing these structural challenges, for example through mergers and acquisitions, is crucial for a turnaround that is longer lasting.", "Vaccine rally and higher inflation expectations have lifted bank stock prices since November, but the long-term performance of the sector rests on higher profitability", "4.1 Non-bank financial sector vulnerabilities could manifest in the high-yield corporate bond market", "Market-based financing of the real economy has remained robust since mid-2020, with conditions continuing to be supported by accommodative policies.", "By December 2020, market based credit to non-financial corporations (NFCs) – i.e. intermediated via markets as opposed to loans typically originated by banks – had recovered from the initial pandemic turmoil, to stand at roughly 20% of total external credit (see Chart 4.1, left panel).[20]", "While euro area non-bank financial institutions were the dominant net buyers of debt overall, net purchases by the Eurosystem were around the same size as those by investment funds (IFs), insurance corporations and pension funds (ICPFs) and other financial institutions combined in the second and third quarter, highlighting the robust indirect support from the official sector.", "Non-banks assumed greater credit risk after the pandemic peaked, driven by negative rating developments", "While fiscal and financial policy measures have indirectly supported non-banks’ asset quality so far, credit risk could trigger valuation losses over the coming months.", "The share of bonds with negative credit watch or outlook held by ICPFs and IFs rose sharply in early 2020, but declined slightly towards the end of the year, partly reflecting policy support to NFCs (see Chart 4.1, right panel).", "Potential rating downgrades could materialise either as policy support is withdrawn abruptly or if higher global interest rates spill over into euro area credit markets, jeopardising the ability of companies to roll over their debt and support the recovery.[21] This in turn would expose non-banks to significant credit losses.", "A rise in yields would also trigger bond valuation losses, to which ICPFs and IFs are more exposed than in the past.", "These sectors have increased the duration in their bond portfolios over recent years in order to boost returns in the challenging environment of ultra-low interest rates.", "But this increases the sensitivity of their assets to rising interest rates (see Chart 4.2, left panel).", "Asset valuation losses from rising bond yields could trigger outflows which, when coupled with low liquidity buffers, could force bond funds to liquidate assets to meet investor redemptions (see Chart 4.5).[22]", "In the short term, ICPFs would face asset valuation losses as well, although these could be more than offset by the drop in liabilities valuation, given the negative duration gap (see Section 4.3).", "The net effect would be an improvement in the equity position and the overall balance sheet capacity of ICPFs.", "Depending on other concurrent macroeconomic developments, ICPFs could then increase asset purchases in some segments at a time when bond funds could be forced to sell.", "Increased duration risk and investor base in different euro area bond market segments", "High-yield corporate bond segments, where investment funds are dominant players, are particularly exposed to an increase in credit spreads.", "Investment funds have typically had a much stronger preference for holding high-yield bonds issued by financial and non-financial corporations, unlike banks and ICPFs, which generally prefer less risky fixed income assets (see Chart 4.2, right panel).", "But high-yield bonds are also the most vulnerable to an increase in credit spreads, which tend to widen when global rates increase.", "In the euro area, though, this segment is small compared with investment grade corporate and sovereign bond segments.", "That said, should higher global yields trigger fund outflows and asset liquidation, it is unlikely that banks and ICPFs – which historically largely underweight high-yield bonds – would substantially step up their presence in these segments, thereby increasing the risk of price dislocation and a credit crunch for more vulnerable corporates.", "Non-banks’ pro-cyclical behaviour and liquidity risks, together with their reliance on public support as seen last March, demonstrate the need to enhance resilience across the sector (see Chapter 5).", "For instance, liquidity risks in some types of investment funds could be limited by lengthening redemption frequencies and setting minimum liquidity buffers.", "Furthermore, the recent event involving Archegos Capital (see Chapter 2), a highly leveraged non-bank entity heavily interconnected with large banks, again raises the issue of contagion due to margin calls, default cascades and fire sales.[23]", "4.2 Investment funds may be vulnerable to a global increase in interest rates", "Overall, since November 2020 investors’ flows have shifted from bond funds to equity funds amid a robust increase in risk appetite.", "While investors mainly preferred bond and money market funds until mid-2020, equity funds started to receive record-high inflows following the COVID-19 vaccine announcements in November 2020 (see Chart 4.3, left panel).", "The significant fiscal stimulus in the United States and the agreement of the Brexit deal between the EU and the United Kingdom also contributed to the surge in risk appetite and equity fund inflows.", "Inflows concentrated on euro area investment funds that focus on global, US and emerging markets, with equity funds receiving the lion’s share.", "By contrast, flows into funds investing in western European markets remained generally stable. The rise in aggregate equity fund flows masks rotation from growth to value funds, benefiting European equity funds over US funds (see Chart 4.3, right panel).", "Flows into western European equity funds investing in the energy and financial sectors have recovered particularly strongly.", "Investors shifted from bond to equity funds, while also favouring equity funds with a US and global focus rather than western Europe", "These developments have been broadly reflected in recent transactions by euro area investment funds. In the fourth quarter of 2020, euro area equity funds purchased about €135 billion of US and other developed economy equities, while bond funds purchased about €45 billion of EME and other developed country sovereign bonds (see Chart 4.4, left panel).", "Investment funds also purchased corporate debt securities across the globe, but at a slower pace than earlier in 2020, due in part to lower issuance activity.", "The credit risk of euro area investment funds remains elevated, while duration risk stands at a multi-year high.", "As a result of continued subdued economic activity, up to a third of investment funds’ NFC debt holdings are subject to a negative credit outlook or credit watch from rating agencies (see Chart 4.1, right panel).", "Coupled with the fact that more than 60% of corporate debt securities purchased in 2020 are either high yield or rated BBB, this highlights the increasing credit risk faced by investment funds.", "In addition, the continued search for yield in a low interest rate environment has pushed investment funds to increase the maturity[24] and, therefore, the duration of their debt securities portfolios (see Chart 4.2, left panel), exposing them to greater interest rate risk from rising yields.", "Euro area equity funds mainly invested in the US and other developed economies’ stock markets, but less in euro area equities", "Significant and abrupt increases in global interest rates may lead to material valuation losses on euro area investment funds’ debt portfolios.", "To date, repricing has been more pronounced for US debt securities than for their euro area equivalents due to the different increases in yields in the two economic areas (see Chart 2.1, left panel).", "Nevertheless, euro area investment funds are heavily exposed to US interest rate risks. In particular, their holdings of US-based and USD-denominated debt securities are close to record levels (see Chart 4.4, right panel) and the duration of their US bond portfolios is high, exceeding that in their overall debt securities portfolios.", "Over recent years, investment funds’ liquidity risk has increased amid a search for yield (see also Box 5).", "Since last November, funds’ cash positions have continued to fall as a proportion of their total assets.", "Cash buffers have declined below pre-pandemic levels to reach new lows (see Chart 4.5, left panel). Liquid asset holdings also stand at relatively low levels, falling below pre-pandemic volumes for funds investing in corporate bonds (see Chart 4.5, right panel).", "This is a concern, as rising credit risks and elevated asset valuations in some financial market segments leave the fund sector vulnerable to shocks.", "Furthermore, an increase, particularly abrupt, in global yields may trigger relatively large redemptions, especially for funds investing in debt securities.", "Given the persistent liquidity risk in investment funds, such shocks may lead to funds selling assets, with the potential to exacerbate adverse market dynamics and propagate spillovers to other financial intermediaries.[25] This underscores the importance of strengthening the resilience of the investment fund sector from a macroprudential perspective (see Chapter 5).", "Funds’ cash buffers continue to fall while liquid asset holdings remain stable at relatively low levels", "Investment fund flows, risk-taking and monetary policy", "This box examines the response of the investment fund sector to monetary policy shocks and the implications of this for financial stability.", "The investment fund sector has more than doubled in size since the global financial crisis. As the sector grows, so does its importance for the funding of economic activity and the transmission of monetary policy.", "But excessive risk-taking by funds can also have damaging effects for the wider financial system when it contributes to high levels of corporate leverage or when risky asset holdings need to be unwound quickly in times of market stress, as occurred in March 2020.", "More4.3 Insurers engage in further risk-taking, but could benefit from the moderate increase in global interest rates", "While the profitability of euro area insurance companies remains subdued, their capitalisation has started to recover.", "Towards the end of 2020, solvency ratios already regained more than half of the decline that occurred amid the initial coronavirus shock (see Chart 4.6, left panel).", "By contrast, insurers’ profitability still lies significantly below multi-year averages (see Chart 4.6, right panel).", "While solvency ratios have mostly recovered from the coronavirus shock, insurers’ profitability remains below multi-year averages", "Despite the signs of improvement in the economic outlook, the insurance sector remains under pressure from low interest rates and weak demand.", "The economic fallout from the pandemic led to a further fall in interest rates over 2020 together with higher financial market volatility.", "These developments weighed on the sector’s investment income. In addition, the recession and the ongoing uncertainty surrounding the pandemic meant that sales of life and savings products remained subdued, despite higher household saving.", "Non-life insurers also saw their new business contract, although the sector is benefiting from rising policy prices and generally solid underwriting profitability.", "This has been particularly evident in retail business lines like motor insurance where fewer loss events were registered due to lockdown measures.", "Going forward, a materialisation of credit risks (see Chapter 1) could further weigh on insurers’ profits.", "Even though profitability prospects remain muted, insurers’ stock valuations have recovered from last year’s losses.", "The stock market valuations of insurance corporations increased over 2020 in tandem with the broader equity market (see Chart 4.7, left panel).", "Life insurers significantly outperformed most other market segments, primarily because the recent moderate steepening of the yield curve has improved investor sentiment towards the sector.", "This development contrasts with the trend observed over recent years, when life insurance stocks typically performed worse than the overall market.", "A decomposition of insurance stock prices shows that the sector’s valuation gains are mainly driven by the positive sentiment on stock markets that started to resurface in November 2020 (see Chart 4.7, middle panel).", "At the same time, the weak profitability prospects for the sector continue to hold down insurers’ valuations.", "Euro area insurers’ stock valuations have recovered from last year’s losses despite muted profitability prospects", "Insurers are taking on more risk as they increase their investments in alternative asset classes. Amid decreasing income from debt securities portfolios, insurers have continued gradually increasing their exposures to higher yielding but potentially riskier alternative assets (see Chart 4.7, right panel).", "Around 70% of these holdings are invested in real estate-related assets. Exposures to commercial real estate in particular could suffer credit and valuation losses if the pandemic-accelerated shift towards more working from home and online shopping persists after lockdown restrictions are lifted (see Chapter 1.5).", "This could have a sizeable impact on insurers’ solvency. Empirical analysis shows that a 10% decline in the value of commercial real estate holdings could wipe out as much as 4% of aggregate insurance excess of assets over liabilities in the EU.[26]", "Insurers’ bond portfolio valuations decline as global rates rise, but effects on capitalisation more than offset these losses due to negative duration gaps", "Although insurers have accumulated record-high exposures to duration risks, higher interest rates would boost the sector’s capitalisation significantly due to negative duration gaps.", "If interest rates on insurers’ fixed income holdings increased by 1%, asset valuation losses would amount to 8.6% of the bond portfolio (€250 billion) compared to 7.7% (€200 billion) four years ago (see Chart 4.8, left panel).", "Global interest rates have started rising in 2021, particularly in the United States. This trend has affected euro area rates, which have also increased albeit more mildly (see Chapter 2).", "Under a scenario of moderately higher interest rates abroad in 2021, euro area insurers’ bond portfolios could lose around €20 billion in value, which could translate into capital losses of the same size (see Chart 4.8, middle panel).[27]", "However, the largest share of insurers’ fixed income portfolios (78%) is invested in euro area assets while only about 7% is invested in US assets.", "Moreover, the sector has a negative duration gap on its balance sheets, with a weighted average duration of assets and liabilities of 7.3 and 13.3 years respectively at the end of 2019.", "As a result, even a small rise in interest rates in the euro area would lead to sizeable reductions in insurers’ liabilities by an estimated €250 billion.", "This decrease would more than offset all asset valuation losses and could lead to net capital gains of more than €150 billion (2%).[28]", "Moderately higher interest rates would only partially dampen the deterioration of insurers’ investment income over the next few years.", "Under the interest rate changes assumed, the average portfolio return would fall to 2% five years ahead compared to 1.8% in a scenario in which interest rates do not increase (see Chart 4.8, right panel).", "A more significant improvement in investment income prospects would require much larger changes in interest rates.", "Consequently, the revenue outlook for the insurance sector remains muted.", "5.1 Supporting economic recovery and the resilience of the banking sector amid pandemic-related vulnerabilities", "Since the November 2020 FSR, policy measures have continued to support financial stability by limiting corporate insolvencies and containing rising unemployment.", "With many euro area countries facing renewed surges in infections, lockdown measures have been reinstated and economic support policies maintained or extended, increasingly in a more targeted and selective manner.[29] Taken together, the extension of economic, monetary, prudential and other support measures has underpinned the functioning of the financial system, prevented widespread bank deleveraging and maintained generally accommodative credit conditions.[30]", "As pandemic and economic conditions allow, extensive policy support, particularly for corporates, could gradually move from being broad based to more targeted.[31]", "As long as significant lockdown measures remain in place to control the pandemic in euro area countries, economic policy support that prevents viable companies from failing and unemployment from rising considerably will also protect near-term financial stability.", "As parts of the economy become better adapted to lockdown measures, increasingly targeted extensions of policy support across euro area countries are already contributing towards limiting the medium-term financial stability side effects and should be continued.", "These adverse effects arise from the growth in sovereign and corporate indebtedness and the allocation of resources to potentially non-viable, “zombie” companies (see Special Feature A), which increase balance sheet vulnerabilities of sovereigns, corporates and banks.", "Adjusting support schemes to strengthen mechanisms for assessing the future viability of beneficiaries or promote debt/equity restructuring for highly leveraged but viable firms could be a particularly useful way of managing financial stability side effects (for example, through existing initiatives such as quasi-equity instruments and the partial conversion of guaranteed loans into direct grants).[32]", "Moreover, fast and effective use of the €750 billion Next Generation EU (NGEU) recovery funds should complement national support measures to mitigate cross-country divergences in the coming years.[33]", "For banks specifically, capital relief measures should continue to prevent excessive deleveraging, which could negatively impact the economic recovery.", "Credit risk and losses for banks are expected to materialise as some businesses suffer permanent damage from the pandemic and become unviable.", "Therefore, as highlighted in previous issues of the FSR, it is crucial that bank capital buffers are usable to absorb losses and to avoid procyclical financial amplification effects due to, for example, bank deleveraging.", "At the same time, managing non-performing loans (NPLs) effectively will also be key to reducing the drag on bank balance sheets and supporting lending.", "In this context, the prudent approach to capital distributions has been extended and adapted from the initial guidance asking financial institutions to refrain from making any distributions to shareholders.", "Following the updated guidance, banks can proceed with capital distributions up to a conservative threshold set by the competent authorities.[34]", "Banks are expected to exercise extreme prudence and engage in discussion with the competent authorities before taking any action on dividend distributions or share buybacks.[35]", "Banks will retain investor confidence by ensuring the proper and timely identification of credit risk, supporting this by using capital buffers in case of need.[36]", "Given the potential for losses to materialise, the ability to distinguish between viable and non-viable borrowers becomes increasingly essential to supporting a robust recovery.", "The policy guidance issued since the November 2020 FSR has continued to emphasise the need to set aside adequate provisions based on assumptions appropriate for the current risk environment and, more generally, to identify credit risk in a timely manner.[37]", "However, preliminary evidence points to banks’ reluctance so far to use available capital space. In particular, initial evidence suggests that banks with less capital headroom above regulatory buffers appear reluctant to use these buffers by letting capital ratios decrease,[38], despite supervisors communicating that they expect these buffers to be used.[39] In recent quarters, lending to corporates by banks with a smaller capital headroom on top of the combined buffer requirement (CBR) has decreased significantly (see Chart 5.1).", "The preliminary evidence points to a more pronounced weakening of credit provision to non-financial corporations, a stronger reduction in risk weights and a tightening in lending conditions by banks closer to the CBR relative to other banks.[40]", "For the moment, these procyclical adjustments may have only limited implications for aggregate credit supply due to the limited number of banks close to the CBR threshold.", "Nevertheless, if credit risk materialises and more banks approach the threshold, there is the risk that procyclical adjustments could become more systemic.", "Preliminary evidence points to stronger deleveraging since the start of the pandemic by banks that are close to the CBR", "In the medium term, a higher share of releasable capital buffers could be considered, as this can enhance banks’ ability to absorb losses and continue providing key financial services in a crisis.", "An enhanced role for releasable capital buffers could strengthen authorities’ ability to act countercyclically.", "It would also reflect the increasingly important role that macroprudential policy needs to play as the first line of defence in preserving financial stability in the face of a severe, system-wide shock.", "Any change to the buffer framework should ensure continued compliance with the applicable international standards set by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision.", "Concerns regarding the expected deterioration in asset quality in the banking sector reinforce the need for effective NPL solutions.", "Among several initiatives under way, the European Commission’s action plan on tackling non-performing loans emphasises two key objectives: (i) the continued development of secondary markets for distressed assets; and (ii) reform of insolvency and debt recovery frameworks.[41]", "The first objective has already played a key role in NPL reductions in some Member States (e.g. Greece and Italy) in recent years.", "This requires an appropriate balance to be struck between strengthening common standards and market transparency, on the one hand, and avoiding excessive administrative barriers to entry to the NPL market, on the other hand.", "The second objective aims to reduce costs and delays, which would translate into higher recoveries for banks and investors, together with higher NPL valuations in the market.", "Moreover, further initiatives may be necessary if NPLs increase beyond current expectations. A common EU blueprint for NPL securitisations benefiting from government guarantees might also be useful.", "EU policymakers should also consider options to restructure and recapitalise distressed but viable companies.", "A more flexible application of the Commission’s framework for public support that would make it easier to set up asset management companies could complement policy efforts to manage potential systemic NPL problems.", "Given the low interest rate environment and profitability challenges, efforts to address structural issues across banks should intensify.", "The euro area banking sector is hampered by low cost-efficiency, limited revenue diversification and overcapacity.", "Banks have increased cost-cutting efforts in response to the pandemic by further reducing the number of staff and branches, but low profitability may limit the required digital transformation.", "Consolidation via mergers and acquisitions could be one potential avenue for reducing overcapacity in the sector.", "This process should be market-driven but can also be supported by completing the banking union and removing barriers to consolidation, such as differences in national insolvency and taxation regimes and restrictions on the free flow of capital and liquidity within banking groups.", "The timely, full and consistent application of the Basel III framework remains essential with a view to strengthening banks’ resilience to withstand future shocks.", "Deferring the implementation timeline by one year freed up operational capacity for banks and supervisors to respond to the immediate priorities related to the pandemic without affecting the substance of the reforms.", "These reforms, which reflect important lessons learned from the global financial crisis, are necessary to further strengthen the regulatory framework for banks.", "The ECB’s updated macroeconomic impact assessment shows that the economic costs of implementing the reforms are modest and temporary, and outweighed by their permanent benefits in terms of strengthening the resilience of the economy to adverse shocks.[42] It also finds that potential deviations from the globally agreed Basel III reforms – for example, with regard to the output floor – would dilute the benefits to the real economy.", "Where ongoing developments point to increasing vulnerabilities, such as in the residential real estate (RRE) sector, policies should prudently balance procyclical considerations against the need to stem the build-up of risk.", "Capital already built up to target RRE risks should only be released to facilitate loss absorption if losses start to materialise.", "At the same time, heightened vulnerabilities require careful monitoring. Going forward, it could be worth considering gradually activating or tightening borrower-based measures, but not before economic conditions stabilise and the impact of the pandemic on RRE markets is clearer.", "Nonetheless, such considerations should carefully consider the stage of the RRE cycle and any potential procyclical effects on demand, especially from income-based limits.", "5.2 Further steps towards developing macroprudential policies for non-banks", "The market turmoil in March 2020 exposed structural fault lines in the non-bank financial sector – in particular liquidity mismatches in investment funds.", "Many money market funds (MMFs) and open-ended investment funds faced acute liquidity stress last spring owing to significant outflows and difficulties in selling assets in markets with little or no secondary trading.", "These funds responded to this liquidity pressure by acting procyclically through asset sales (see Chart 5.2 and Box 6).", "Over 200 European investment funds also suspended redemptions.[43] This behaviour added to pressure on asset valuations and market liquidity, contributing to the tightening of funding conditions in the real economy.", "This tightening ultimately only eased when central banks took extraordinary policy action. Furthermore, renewed risk-taking and growing liquidity mismatches in funds in recent months continue to pose increasing risks (see Chapter 4).", "Investment funds shed large amounts of securities during the March market turmoil and have been rebuilding positions since then", "A comprehensive macroprudential approach for non-banks remains a key missing element in the overall policy framework.", "Many investment funds, insurance corporations and pension funds are subject to relatively weak liquidity requirements.", "They are typically designed from a microprudential perspective. A comprehensive macroprudential approach instead would address structural vulnerabilities and emerging risks in the non-bank financial sector.", "This would lower the need for extraordinary central bank intervention to tackle significant market stress.", "Furthermore, it would also complement monetary policy in good times, thereby further aligning the financial stability and monetary policy mandates of central banks.", "The Financial Stability Board (FSB) is expected to issue recommendations aimed at strengthening the resilience of the non-bank financial sector.", "Once issued, they should be swiftly implemented in the EU as appropriate. These recommendations will stem from the ongoing FSB work on MMFs, open-ended investment funds and margining practices.", "The vulnerabilities in MMFs must be addressed, in particular by reducing their liquidity mismatch. This could be achieved by limiting investments in relatively illiquid assets or increasing liquidity buffers, which should be made more usable given the evidence that MMFs have been reluctant to draw down on their buffers in the past.", "These are among the measures being examined by the FSB in relation to the MMF sector.[44] Given the interdependencies of money markets across jurisdictions and currencies, this work is of particular importance for ensuring a globally consistent approach to policy reforms.", "Any FSB recommendations on MMFs should feed into the review of the EU Money Market Fund Regulation planned for 2022.", "For open-ended investment funds, minimum liquidity requirements could be considered to increase their asset liquidity profile, while requirements on redemption frequencies and notice periods would help to bolster their resilience, thereby reducing their reliance on crisis liquidity management tools.[45]", "Finally, it is important to assess whether tools to reduce excessive procyclicality in initial margins for derivatives – a topic relevant for both bank and non-bank financial institutions – need to be recalibrated and/or revised.[46]", "There is also scope for increasing the transparency and predictability of margining practices.", "The ongoing review of the EU Solvency II framework could also strengthen the macroprudential approach to insurance companies.", "The proposal put forward by the European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority in its Opinion suggests introducing measures of a macroprudential nature that would usefully equip national supervisory authorities with additional powers to tackle systemic risk in insurance companies.[47] These include powers to introduce a capital surcharge for systemic risk, require the development of systemic risk and liquidity risk management plans, and temporarily freeze redemption rights.", "The Solvency II review could also consider other macroprudential aspects proposed by the European Systemic Risk Board such as new Pillar 2 liquidity provisioning requirements for insurers with a vulnerable liquidity profile and making the volatility adjustment symmetric to build capital buffers during good times.[48]", "Investment funds’ procyclical selling and cash hoarding: a case for strengthening regulation from a macroprudential perspective", "During the March 2020 market turmoil, investment funds shed assets on a large scale – but was this selling commensurate with the outflows they faced or was it much larger?", "This box finds evidence of the latter, highlighting that the less regulated non-UCITS funds tended to engage in more procyclical selling and cash hoarding than UCITS funds.[49] While it can be rational for fund managers individually to sell assets in excess of current outflows when uncertainty about future redemptions is high, such cash hoarding may be detrimental to the stability of financial markets from a macroprudential perspective.[50]",

through the coronavirus pandemic may have supported not just otherwise viable firms, but also unprofitable but still operating firms – often referred to as “zombies”.", "This has in turn raised questions about an increased risk of zombification in the euro area economy, which could constrain the post-pandemic recovery.", "Firm-level, loan-level and supervisory data for euro area companies suggest that zombie firms may have temporarily benefited from loan schemes and accommodative credit conditions – but likely only to a modest degree.", "These firms may face tighter eligibility criteria for schemes and more recognition of credit risk in debt and loan pricing in the future.", "Tackling the risk of zombification more fundamentally requires the consideration of suggested reforms to insolvency frameworks, and better infrastructure for banks to manage non-performing loans.", "The ECB has been intensifying its quantitative work aimed at capturing climate-related risks to financial stability.", "This includes estimating financial system exposures to climate-related risks, upgrading banking sector scenario analysis and monitoring developments in the financing of the green transition.", "Considerable progress has been made on capturing banking sector exposures to firms that are subject to physical risks from climate change.", "While data and methodological challenges are still a focus of ongoing debates, our analyses suggest (i) somewhat concentrated bank exposures to physical and transition risk drivers, (ii) a prevalence of exposures amongst more vulnerable banks and in specific regions, (iii) risk-mitigating potential for interactions across financial institutions, and (iv) strong inter-temporal dependency conditioning the interaction of transition and physical risks.", "At the same time, investor interest in “green finance” continues to grow – but so-called greenwashing concerns need to be addressed to foster efficient market mechanisms.", "Both the assessment of risks and the allocation of finance to support the orderly transition to a more sustainable economy can benefit from enhanced disclosures, including of firms’

However, defining a market is no easy matter.", "Indeed, questions of market definition are among the most complex and materially consequential issues in media law, policy, and regulation.", "In fields such as antitrust and competition law, setting the boundaries of a market to include or exclude certain actors may, as Brett Christophers observes, “generate very different assessments of competition issues, and thus very different forms, vectors and intensities of market intervention and reconfiguration.”8", "It is instructive to consider the language used by major media companies to describe the markets in which their video services compete and how such descriptions are often calibrated to serve the strategic purposes of each company.", "Media mogul Barry Diller once described video streaming as “a giant arms race”9—evoking the familiar streaming wars discourse of direct competition between services.", "The CEO of NBCUniversal, Steve Burke, has stated that “Everybody is going to compete with everybody. ”10 BBC Director-General Tony Hall, reflecting on the status of the BBC’s on-demand service iPlayer, described the BBC’s competitive position as “a medium-sized planet compared to the huge gas giants of the US—the Netflixes, Apples, and Amazons,” in a claim that connects companies in multiple industries, with multiple revenue models, and both public-service and commercial measures of success.11 In contrast, Netflix CEO Reed Hastings expanded the market boundary further yet in rejecting the idea that Netflix’s primary competitors are video services; instead, he identifies the videogame Fortnite, and even sleep, as the company’s main competition.12 Given this discursive slipperiness, where market boundaries seem to expand or contract depending on who is speaking, the problem of market definition becomes highly significant.", "These CEO statements have a performative dimension in that they seek to shape as well as describe a competitive field.", "Napoli and Caplan refer to this as the “disconnect between how these companies have perceived themselves—and want to be perceived by others—and how they actually function in the contemporary [media] ecosystem.", "”13 In his analysis of Netflix’s investor relations, Colin Crawford, building on the work of Timothy Havens, describes the “investor lore”—“narratives and discourses of value which organize, justify and govern [ …]", "new industrial practices”—that constructs public understanding of video and entertainment markets.14 News, business, and trade press coverage—itself an end-product of the markets it purports to describe—also plays a part in this process, presenting varied and sometimes conflicting visions of markets and their boundaries.15", "This discursive aspect of competition has been famously analyzed by Michel Callon in The Laws of the Markets.", "For Callon, any understanding of competition depends on how a market is framed:", "Competition, whether perfect or imperfect, is not a starting point but a finishing point. It can exist and really does exist—and that is what makes it so valuable.", "However, it occurs only when the boundaries, the technical options, have been selected and stabilized, i.e., in a world that is already highly structured and shaped.16", "As Callon observes, markets have both institutional and discursive dimensions, and a feedback loop exists between the two.", "For media industry studies—as a field concerned with both institutions and discourse—there are several considerations here.", "On the one hand, there is the need to understand how specific markets have been institutionally defined and what this means for questions of market power, efficiency, conduct, gatekeeping, and other relevant issues.", "A second task is to explore how particular market boundaries have come to be made thinkable, common-sensical, legible, and acceptable (their discursive dimension).", "Here, it is helpful to consider the work of Callon, Christophers, and other key thinkers in the critical social science of markets, as well as media scholars such as Patrick Vonderau, whose essays on digital video markets have emphasized the need for “an analysis of the very practices through which markets are constantly made and remade.", "How can these perspectives enrich understanding of video? We suggest that a textured account of audiovisual competition needs to do two things: first, to move beyond mono-dimensional accounts of competition by paying closer attention to the differences among services, their business models, geographies, catalogs, and operations; and second, to explore how market boundaries are drawn and how such boundaries make markets seem variously larger or smaller, more or less competitive, more or less crowded, depending on who is speaking.", "Hence, the streaming wars case provides an opportunity to reflect, once more, on the complexity and nuance of video markets and their relation to broader entertainment and leisure markets.", "For illustrative purposes, let us now consider a specific national market and its mix of video services.", "Figure 1 presents the twelve most popular internet-distributed video services available in Australia in December 2019.18 Australia has been chosen as the site of our analysis for practical reasons, but we expect that some principles of our analysis will be transferrable, and that readers will be able to extend the analysis to include the firms and service categories most relevant to their own national context.", "When grouped together as internet-distributed video services, the leading players in the Australian market appear thus.", "From this perspective (i.e., when the market is defined by distribution technology alone), all the major services for streaming video in Australia appear to be in the same competitive field.", "Yet a closer look reveals a more complex picture of different service types and categories, including the following:", "Multi-territory, US-based SVODs—Netflix, Apple TV+, Disney+, and Amazon Prime Video.", "Stan, a national SVOD owned by an Australian media corporation, Nine Entertainment.", "Foxtel Now, the national multichannel operator’s over-the-top (OTT) service.19", "The advertiser-supported services of three national commercial networks (NineNow, TenPlay, SevenPlus) that mostly allow “catch-up” availability of linear programming and also increasingly feature separately licensed programming.", "The on-demand services of the two public-service broadcasters, ABC iView (government funded) and SBS On Demand (ad-supported).20", "As this breakdown suggests, the category of streaming video is in fact a place-holder for a multiplicity of different services with distinct histories, libraries, and content strategies.", "How can we understand the interactions between these services? Are they all in direct competition? Research from other national contexts suggests a need for caution here, as services are often competing for quite different things, and many are complementary rather than directly competitive.", "Ampere Analysis observes that “the interaction between SVoD and pay TV service uptake is complex and varies significantly by market,” with territories including the United Kingdom exhibiting a high degree of complementarity among services, while other territories (notably the United States) exhibit some evidence of substitution (cable-cutting).21", "This makes sense given the varied range of services in the market before SVOD in different countries and their creation of different value propositions and satisfaction levels.", "In the United States, the substitution occurs between cable/satellite and multichannel video programming distributors (vMVPDs), which offer fundamentally the same product distributed using a different technology.", "The answer to the question “who is competing with whom?” also depends on what specific metric is under consideration (viewing time, subscriber numbers, revenues, and so on) and whether services are also competing for inputs such as production resources, talent, and scripts.22", "Let us now consider in more detail some vectors of differentiation that organize the field. Here, three considerations are especially important: (1) content characteristics; (2) revenue source, business model, and value to the firm; and (3) geographic scale.23", "The first key distinction among these video services is the variation in content they offer, including their specialty genres, original productions, and the depth and breadth of their catalogs.", "The extent of variation is such that most of the above services are not readily substitutable: each offers exclusive content and a particular mix of genres and program types.", "At a general level, clear content differences can be identified in the size and variety of the libraries of content these services offer, as Figure 2 shows.", "Figure 2 charts the differences among the libraries. The SVODs (Prime Video, Netflix, Stan, Foxtel Now) typically have catalogs in the low thousands of titles: Stan offers half of the roughly five thousand titles offered by Netflix Australia, which is about a third of what Prime Video offers.24", "The services maintain these titles for a duration measured in years. The broadcasters’ services, in contrast, typically have a smaller catalog (typically in hundreds of titles) consisting of original network productions that are available for weeks or months rather than years and a smattering of back-catalog titles (mostly the United States).", "These services rarely have full series available. The broadcaster services remain primarily “catch-up” services that maintain residual norms of the ephemerality of “television” scheduling, while SVOD services are more characteristic of a precursor such as video rental.", "Apple here assumes an outlier position: the Apple TV+ library consists of a small number of premium exclusive shows initially released on a weekly basis.", "The library differences indicated by the cluster evident in Figure 2 suggest subsets of services that may “compete”—at least on the basis of offering similar content scale and viewing experience—while the relationship between the subsets is more complementary.", "The services are also distinguished in terms of the variety of content offered in their libraries. A distinction in strategy occurs between those that offer several types of programming but less depth in any one (generalist) and those that offer lesser range in types of programming but more depth (specialist).", "The SVODs tend to offer a deep but restricted mix of genres, compared to the much broader but shallower offering of the broadcasters’ services (which cover the full spectrum of news, sports, light entertainment, and local content provided by broadcasters).", "Consequently, viewers seeking local news cannot easily switch from a broadcast service to an SVOD in a manner that makes them interchangeable.", "As an analogy, like internet-distributed video, “store” is a general category of a place that consumers buy goods; however, all stores do not directly compete.", "An office goods store competes as meaningfully with a teen fashion store as a film service competes with the one offering sports.", "Just as broadcast and multichannel television has simultaneously offered news, sport, fiction, game shows, and films in different dayparts or channels, internet-distributed video content likewise reproduces this range of desired content across the diverse marketplace of services.", "Our point here is a basic but important one: all video is not interchangeable, and consequently, these various services do not compete directly in the manner suggested by the blunt criterion of distribution technology (i.e., they all offer internet-distributed video).25 As Kevin Sanson and Gregory Steirer have argued, the industrial logics of streaming video are not uniform.26 Furthermore, viewers’ regard of these different services derives from more than content characteristics.", "That content is part of an overall value proposition that includes type of content, depth of content, user experience (ability to find desired content, ease of use, interface), and whether viewers pay through a fee or the tedium of commercials.", "Internet-distributed video services are highly differentiated by these measures.", "Revenue Source, Business Model, and Value to the Firm", "A second distinguishing characteristic of video services includes the intertwined considerations of revenue source, business model, and value to the firm.", "Revenue source is often glossed over, or erroneously conflated, in industry commentary about video services.", "Despite their considerable differences in content and geographic scale, multi-territory SVODs (Netflix), national SVODs (Stan), and internet-distributed services from pay-TV providers (Foxtel Now) are all funded directly by subscriber payment.", "YouTube, in contrast, is funded through advertising and cross-subsidized by its corporate parent, Google, although it also offers an ad-free subscription product in YouTube Premium.", "Public-service media streaming services (ABC iView and SBS) receive public funding, although the latter also relies on advertiser funding.", "Such differences in what is traded—subscriber fees, attention, and public funds—lead the broad field of internet-distributed video to fail what Aspers has described as a fundamental definition of a market—that it is about trade of a common thing.27 Following Aspers, separate markets exist among those services that compete for subscriber fees and those that compete for advertiser dollars.", "By shifting the lens in this way, we see how SVODs compete with other leisure services such as gaming and how AVODs compete with ad-funded linear services, other ad-supported media, and growing forms of ad-spending such as search and social media—in an effort to convince advertisers that they offer optimal audiences and tools for addressing them.", "What are the competitive relations between and within each of these revenue categories? Advertiser-funded services do not compete with subscription services for revenues because the former are free to the viewer and the latter require payment.", "In other words, their business models can be understood as complementary in the same way that broadcast television and video-store rentals in a bygone era were complementary from the point of view of revenue source.", "Viewers, at least those with an internet connection and sufficient awareness of the various services on offer, consequently all have access to a wide variety of monetarily free, advertiser-funded services, but will likely limit their purchase of subscription services based on their disposable income, the content differentiation noted above, and the value proposition offered.", "There is a monetary budget constraint among the subscription services, but a “time/attention constraint” in advertiser-funded services.", "These differences are crucial to distinguishing content strategy and how services seek to attract viewers.", "As a result of these varying revenue sources, different internet-distributed video services have different criteria for success.", "While all compete for viewer attention, the metrics that really matter, and how and why they matter, are distinct to each revenue source.", "For advertiser-funded services, the most important metric is the revenue generated from advertisements—which is closely linked to overall viewing hours.", "Similarly, the broadcasters’ AVOD services sell attention in a manner similar to their linear broadcasts.", "In contrast to the case of ad-funded services, the baseline metric for success of SVODs including Stan, Netflix, and Disney+ is their number of subscribers.", "Netflix is unusual among these services in being the only pure SVOD service that is overwhelmingly reliant on subscriber payments and unable to cross-subsidize and integrate its video service with other lines of business.", "For Netflix, metrics such as time spent on the service are likely useful as predictors of satisfaction with the service necessary for continued subscription (heavy usage might generally predict less likelihood of a user canceling their subscription).", "However, increasing viewing hours is not Netflix’s primary aim. Viewing hours and behavior (e.g., binge-like viewing) are proxies to Netflix for the metric that really matters to the company and its shareholders—subscriber numbers.", "Purely publicly funded internet-distributed video services (ABC iView) and hybrid public-funded/ad-funded services (SBS On Demand) have yet other criteria for success.", "While these services are keenly aware of their digital viewing/engagement metrics, their public-service mission means that they see these metrics through the prism of considerations such as public impact, public value, and Charter fulfillment.28", "Overlooking the differences among what these video services trade video for leads to misunderstanding competitive dynamics.", "One common misunderstanding focuses on the belief that there is a common market for attention. This idea holds that attention to SVODs is “lost” by linear services in a manner that diminishes advertising revenue.", "The actual impact likely appears paradoxical though completely in line with classic economic theory. Although linear viewing of broadcasters declined markedly in the United States with mainstreaming of cable service, such that their share of viewers declined from 90 to 64 percent during the 1980s, and then to 46 percent by 2005, advertisers’ spending on them did not decline.29 The gross rating points (number of ad exposures to viewers) available declined, but that decreased supply, matched with constant demand, led the price of reaching those viewers to increase so that television ad spending, on the whole, has remained remarkably constant despite diminishing audience size (advertisers pay the same amount to channels, but pay more per exposure).", "In the last decade, advertisers have moved some spending from television (decreasing demand), but that results from the existence of other advertising tools such as search and social media that offer advertisers a better—or different—value proposition, rather than a function of attention gathered by SVODs.", "Business model ties revenue source and content strategy. Because these services trade video for different things—payment, attention—they build business models and content strategies that vary accordingly.", "An AVOD service derives value from mass viewing, either from having mass popularity or a mass of videos all gathering attention (YouTube), or from attracting the kinds of viewers that attract premium advertising rates.", "In contrast, SVODs must offer content viewers are willing to pay for. As we explore next, many services are not focused centrally on that payment (Apple, Amazon) or might be using the SVOD as a way to more directly monetize libraries of intellectual property created for other licensors (Disney+), while others yet are built around providing a video service distinctive and valuable enough to warrant payment (Stan, Netflix).", "As these examples suggest, there is great variation among the revenue sources and thus primary metrics of success among internet-distributed video services.", "This variation complicates any attempt to place these services into a singular competitive field. Public service, ad-supported, and subscriber-supported services trade video content for different things, and they judge their success accordingly.", "Caricatures of competition—for example, narratives of Netflix “displacing” the BBC, or a battle royale between American tech giants such as Amazon, Netflix and Apple—are misleading.", "While services ultimately vie for the time attention, and sometimes payment of viewers in their target markets, the metrics that really count to each category of funding are distinct, and not a zero-sum dynamic.", "A further defining characteristic is the relative importance of video services to the overall strategy and revenue of the owning firm.", "For the leading US technology firms offering internet-distributed video services—Amazon, Google, Apple—these video services provide benefits for other business objectives, such as collecting data or expanding e-commerce or hardware sales.", "We can therefore draw a further distinction between at least three categories of video service: those where video is the primary or only activity (Netflix), those where video forms part of a wider set of media activities (including Disney+, Stan, and the commercial TV and public-service operators offering online catch-up services), and those where video activities are secondary to the larger business objectives of the parent company (Apple, Amazon, and Google/Alphabet).30", "Value to the firm provides the final component of this cluster of distinguishing characteristics. The revenue derived from video service is the whole of some businesses and quite marginal to others, leading it to have different importance within different firms.", "This also has implications for how we understand dynamics between firms. Seeing Australian video services from this perspective allows us to draw finer distinctions between what could otherwise be glossed as “Big Tech” companies, which have been conflated in acronyms such as FAANG (Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix, Google), GAFA (the same minus Netflix), and poorly differentiated anxiety about “tech” and “platform” companies.", "The value of Apple TV+ and Prime Video to their parent companies (Apple and Amazon) is largely indirect and of lesser overall significance to the revenue base than for “pure” video services like Netflix or those integrated in media conglomerates.", "For example, Netflix’s revenues in 2019 were approximately US$20 billion, the vast majority of which derived from user subscriptions.", "In contrast, Amazon Inc.’s overall revenues for the same period were US$280 billion, with Prime Video essentially adding value to Amazon Prime memberships and thus enticing consumers to increase their retail spend with Amazon.31 Netflix is fundamentally different from these other companies because of its exclusive reliance on video.", "Unlike Amazon, Google, and Apple, Netflix does not have the luxury of cross-subsidizing its video operation with other sectors.", "Its continued commercial viability relies onits ability to attract subscribers.", "Another structuring difference among the corporations offering internet-distributed video services is the ownership of large libraries of intellectual property, production facilities, and established content brands that enable vertical integration of video production and circulation.", "The historical dominance of the United States in creating this intellectual property has advantaged US media conglomerates that are building internet-distributed services to leverage their libraries of content.", "Services such as Hulu, CBS All Access, and, to some degree, HBO have offered internet-distributed video built on this logic for some time, and these services provide the basis for more recent launches of Disney+, Paramount+, and HBO Max that are larger and more strategic efforts to collapse layers of circulation and more directly connect companies that produce video with consumers’ dollars.", "Importantly, these services based on deep catalogs of preexisting intellectual property should be conceptually distinguished from the services offered by Amazon, Apple, and Netflix, not because they are not “tech” companies, but because of the underlying economics of their businesses that derive from owning libraries of video offerings.", "Firms that primarily derive revenue from distribution infrastructure and internet service providers (ISPs) can also use free or discounted access to proprietary internet-distributed video services as a tool to drive take-up of internet plans (HBO Max, Peacock in the United States).", "Though such cases can be identified around the globe, a particularly powerful combination is AT&T in United States, which purchased Time Warner and key assets such as the Warner Bros. film and television library and multichannel brands such as CNN and HBO in 2019, and combined them in support of its HBO Max service.", "The advantage of this vertical integration could be particularly acute in the United States, where the elimination of net neutrality provisions enables AT&T to throttle or seek rents from services competing with HBO Max.", "A further consideration is how ISPs might use video services as loss leaders—in a way comparable to, but still distinct from, companies such as Apple, Amazon, and Google—to offer video services that seem to compete, but have quite different strategic purposes for their companies.", "These companies offer video for varied reasons, and those reasons lead to different priorities in spending and willingness—and ability—to accept financial losses.", "Seeing internet-distributed video as a single competitive field therefore fails to account for the significantly different measures of success that govern the operation of different services.", "Geographic scale is an important consideration for any analysis of media competition because a common feature of media industries—especially internet-distributed video—is very low marginal costs, which incentivizes firms to seek economies of scale.", "In other words, most costs are bound up in the making of the good—a television show or film—while sharing the show with additional viewers attracts little or no further cost.", "Thus, the industry is incentivized to distribute a title across the widest possible audience most efficiently to recoup the content investment—whether paid in attention or time.", "The distribution architecture of the internet has allowed companies seeking to provide multi-territory distribution with more direct ways of reaching multi-territory audiences than the norms afforded by broadcast and multichannel distribution—although it is important to acknowledge that moving-image distribution has been multi-territory for most of its history.32 Commercial success for internet-distributed video services does not require global or multi-territory scale; however, available scale does significantly affect the content and strategy of the service.", "Rearranging our video services according to geography produces yet another organization of the competitive field.", "A key distinction emerges between multi-territory services (YouTube, Prime Video, Netflix, Disney+) that operate across a large number of countries and national services that do not benefit from global economies of scale and are available only in one country (Stan, ABC iView, SevenPlus, TenPlay, NineNow, and SBS On Demand).", "There is a profound difference between the cost structures of multi-territory and national SVOD services.", "The scale of Netflix’s original production budget—US$15 billion in 2019—is often cited as an indication of its outsized power,33 but Netflix is servicing 148.8 million subscriber accounts with that budget.", "Per subscriber account, that spend is US$100.80.34 To draw valid comparisons, we must consider budgets in relation to subscriber levels, although there are competitive advantages in scale.", "Available scale also enables different content strategies. A multi-territory service with an extensive subscriber base such as Netflix can target program tastes and sensibilities that might not be significant at a national level but become significant with multi-territory aggregation.35", "Netflix is able to spend far more on programming overall, but that programming is also designed to service viewers in various languages and a wide array of taste cultures.", "Netflix cannot offer the depth of local content associated with national services—certainly not in each of the markets it serves—which again points to a degree of complementarity between Netflix and national services.36 Indeed, national video services are likely to offer very different content than those with multi-territory aims and are also likely to have far fewer dollars to spend.", "Recent analysis by Variety and Ampere Analysis note the high amount of local content that many dominant national services carry.", "For example, Germany’s Joyn offered 66 percent German titles (Netflix 4 percent), United Kingdom’s ITV Plus 65 percent (Netflix 7 percent), and India’s ALTBalaji 76 percent (Netflix 8 percent).37 In the European context, research by the European Audiovisual Observatory has also established that domestic video services are more likely to feature higher levels of local content.38 Different viewers prioritize domestic and US content differently; hence, services that seek to offer domestic versus foreign content are somewhat more complementary than competitive with those offering mostly US titles.", "In the global market, US services compete more directly with each other because all rely heavily on US-produced content.", "Another point of differentiation within the major multi-territory SVOD services (Disney+, Amazon Prime Video, Netflix, Apple TV+) is the extent to which they engage multi-territory production—a distinction that blends content and geography.", "Netflix has progressively expanded its original production worldwide, shooting original series and movies in more than thirty countries.", "Although the “streaming wars” narrative has most frequently given top billing to the battle between Netflix and Disney+, to date, Disney’s investment in original international production remains minimal compared to Netflix.", "In other words, there is a notable difference in operational dynamics between national services and multi-territory services and, furthermore, between the multi-territory services committed to significant international production investment (especially Netflix) and those using a “US export” model (Apple and Disney, at this stage).", "Although Netflix also started as a US-only service, proper conceptualization of the relationship among these services requires addressing these distinctions.", "Suggesting a slightly different dynamic, Amazon has commissioned content outside the United States, but far fewer titles, and mostly only in countries that are retail priorities such as India, Germany, and the United Kingdom.", "Amazon’s video strategy is intricately connected to the geography of its retail business. It uses the video service to drive Prime memberships that encourage more retail shopping in countries where it has an expansive retail offering.", "Its original video production strategy likewise preferences those countries that Amazon has targeted for retail development, as evidenced by expensive Amazon originals such as Inside Edge (an Indian cricket drama) and Beat (a German thriller).", "In other countries, the video service may simply be a strategy of preparing the market for eventual retail service.", "As this section illustrates, multiple attributes transect the internet-distributed video services in meaningful yet inconsistent ways.", "The competitive field looks very different depending on whether services are sorted by their content and value proposition, their revenue source and business model, or geographic reach.", "This analysis has only considered these characteristics among internet-distributed video services, but expanding that field to include video distributed using other technologies such as DVDs, cable and satellite TV, and linear broadcast television adds yet further complexity.", "Viewers choose among video distributed by many services, including broadcast and multichannel (cable and satellite) services, that coexist with internet-distributed video.", "Defining a market according to distribution technology alone may be the least helpful distinction in developing sophisticated analyses of the extent of the competition, complementarity, and substitutability in domestic video markets.", "In this article, we have argued for a nuanced view of competition in internet-distributed video as a means to move beyond the reductive frame of streaming wars.", "We have shown that there are multiple vectors that structure and define markets discrepantly. Content characteristics, business model/revenue source, and geography, among other factors, subdivide these services to create more complementarity than commonly recognized.", "Why does this matter? Beyond the obvious need for analytical precision, there are several reasons why a multifaceted conceptualization of competition among video services is important.", "Competition matters to the extent that it shapes people’s access to content, the price they pay, the diversity of content available, and the ability to switch between providers.", "There is a clear public interest in clarifying understanding of who is competing with whom in video services and on what basis: this is essential for the purposes of effective media regulation as well as for meaningful analysis, critique, and scholarly investigation.", "Defining markets by distribution technology alone is insufficient for conceptualizing the multiple competitive relations among streaming video services, and—just as importantly—between those services and legacy linear services.", "However, other implications need to be considered as well.", "For example, changing understandings of competition require that we also reconsider our assumptions of market power—including the market power of key players like Netflix, Google, Apple, and Amazon—precisely because the market shares of relevant firms expand or contract when we move the market boundary.", "In its investor-targeted long-term view, Netflix strategically identifies its competitors as including “linear networks, pay-per-view content, DVD watching, other Internet networks, video gaming, web browsing, magazine reading, video piracy, and much more.”39", "Hence, Netflix argues for the largest market possible and makes its own position in that market appear modest.", "Apple and Amazon have similarly sought to present themselves as competing within very large and multidimensional markets, such as entertainment and retail, rather than achieving positions of dominance in smaller markets, such as online grocery goods or smartphone hardware.", "The argument that ad-supported YouTube meaningfully keeps subscriber-funded Netflix “in check” through idealized competitive forces within a single market is therefore questionable.", "Rather, these two internet-distributed video services have outsized influence within distinct markets, and competition policy needs to be alert to the implications of that scale.", "As we have shown, changing our view of a video market can dramatically shrink or expand the boundaries of competition, and thus alter a company’s perceived position of market dominance or vulnerability.", "Is Netflix competing with every leisure activity, including sleep, or is it dominating a small market of multinational SVOD services?", "Does its giant status prevent others from entering the market, or does it offer a particular value proposition of on-demand US content that leaves ample room for other services with a more local focus?", "The answers depend very much on looking past the common feature of using the internet to distribute video, to factors such as what content do services offer, what revenue model and business strategy do they use, in support of what corporate aim, and how do factors of multi-territory or single territory scale circumscribe the competitive field.", "As policy-makers grapple with the challenge of addressing regulatory imbalances between different forms of video—and as some countries consider a shift toward a “harmonized” regulatory environment where media services would have the same obligations regardless of their mode of distribution40—the stakes of these questions increase, along with the risks of unintended consequences.", "For example, should domestically owned services face different policy than those based outside the country?", "Should annual revenues govern policy application? Should services with different value propositions be regulated the same way?", "Without doubt, the advent of internet-distributed video services has complicated regulatory regimes that were already overburdened by the need to sort policy for discrepant distribution technology with discrepant funding structures that increasingly made once-national television ecosystems increasingly multi-territorial in terms of the ownership of services, channels, and producers.", "There is no single policy approach revealed by the analysis here; rather, the complexity of the ecosystem points to the need to go back to first principles and the aims behind policy.", "In many countries, the ecosystem of video services is profoundly and irreversibly changed.

(Huya) and DouYu International Holdings Limited (DouYu).", "Both companies operate game live streaming platforms in China and are backed by Chinese internet giant Tencent.", "While this is China’s third merger prohibition decision since the inception of the merger control regime in 2008, it is the first time China has prohibited a merger between domestic companies in the technology sector.", "We examine in this article some of the noteworthy features of what is yet another milestone in China’s antitrust enforcement history.", "Huya and DouYu are two leading game live streaming platforms in China with a combined market share of at least 60 percent in the domestic game live streaming market.", "Before the merger, Huya was already solely controlled by Tencent; and DouYu was jointly controlled by Tencent and DouYu’s founder team.", "If the merger had gone through, Tencent (as the ultimate parent) would have moved from a situation of joint control to sole control over DouYu.", "SAMR assessed not only horizontal overlaps but also the vertical relationships the proposed merger would give rise to.", "This is the first time a Chinese antitrust authority has analysed vertical effects in a prohibition decision.", "- Horizontal effects – In view of the merged entity’s combined market share of at least 60 percent in the game live streaming market and the high entry barrier, SAMR concluded the merger would restrict or eliminate competition in the game live streaming market, strengthening the dominance of Tencent (through its control of the merged entity) post-merger.", "- Vertical effects – Upstream of the game live streaming market is the online game operation services market, in which Tencent is the largest player with an over 40% market share.", "In the prohibition decision, SAMR analysed two vertical theories of harm, summarised as follows:", "a) Input foreclosure – Tencent, as an online game operation services provider, owns online game copyright licenses, which SAMR considered a critical input for the downstream market for game live streaming.", "Post-merger, SAMR found that Tencent would have the ability and incentive to foreclose downstream competitors by blocking their access to such licenses, thereby restricting or excluding competition in the downstream market for game live streaming.", "b) Promotion channel foreclosure – Game live streaming provides a vital channel of promotion for the games of online game operation services providers.", "Post-merger, SAMR was of the view that Tencent would have the ability and incentive to use its downstream market power to deny its upstream competitors from having the necessary channels to promote their games (through live streaming), thereby restricting or excluding competition in the upstream market for online game operation services.", "Not satisfied with any of the multiple remedies packages proposed to address these anticompetitive effects, SAMR ultimately blocked the merger after a relatively short review period of less than eight months.", "By comparison, it took SAMR an average of 10 months to accept commitments in 2020 and 13 months in 2019.", "First prohibition involving domestic companies in the digital sector", "There have been many mergers in the digital sector in China, so the Huya/DouYu case is remarkable in that it is the first time that a merger concerning this sector has been blocked, and it is the first prohibition involving domestic companies only.", "One reason for the sea change is that mergers between Chinese tech companies were previously rarely (if ever) notified to or scrutinised by the authority in the first place.", "The adoption of the ‘variable interest entity’ (VIE) structure by Chinese internet companies, including Huya, DouYu and Tencent, was believed to have made their merger filings ‘unacceptable’ to SAMR, but this all changed in late 2020 when SAMR announced that VIE deals were subject to China’s merger filing rules as with any other deal.[1]", "The Huya/DouYu merger was filed on 16 Nov 2020 and therefore one of the earlier deals involving VIE companies to be notified to the authority.", "Prohibiting it marks another milestone in SAMR’s effort to regulate the digital sector, which has been under the regulatory spotlight since late 2020.[2]", "The Huya/DouYu prohibition is the third time China’s antitrust authority has prohibited a proposed transaction, since the inception of the merger control regime in 2008.", "In March 2009, the Ministry of Commerce (MOFCOM), China’s then competent authority, prohibited Coca-Cola’s proposed US$2.4 billion bid for Chinese fruit-juice maker Huiyuan.", "In June 2014, MOFCOM issued its second prohibition decision, blocking a proposed operational joint venture, known as the P3 Network, by three large global shipping companies.", "Compared with the European Commission, which prohibited 10 deals over the same period, it would appear that SAMR is taking a more cautious approach towards blocking deals, which could be argued to make this recent decision all the more significant.", "The Huya/DouYu prohibition should not be interpreted as a signal that SAMR is no longer willing to clear deals in the digital space.", "A few days before this prohibition decision, on 7 July 2021, Tencent was fined for not filing its 2013 acquisition of a 36.5% stake in China’s search engine giant Sogou,[3] but six days later, on 13 July, SAMR published its unconditional approval of Tencent’s more recent plan to take over the same company Sogou (now US-listed).", "It is also noteworthy that although many previously un-notified mergers involving the VIE structure were notified to and fined as gun-jumping cases by SAMR in recent months,[4] the Huya/DouYu merger is the first tech merger in which SAMR has identified serious competition concerns warranting a prohibition.", "Finally, where a tech deal does raise competition concerns, it appears that SAMR remains open to behavioural remedies.", "On 24 July 2021, SAMR issued a gun-jumping decision, again against Tencent for its 2016 acquisition of China Music Corporation.", "It is the first published gun-jumping decision in which SAMR has identified competition concerns. However, instead of requesting that the parties unwind the completed transaction (which is within SAMR’s power to do), SAMR imposed behavioural remedies on Tencent, including requiring Tencent to relinquish its exclusive music rights, waive the preferential terms it has with music copyright holders, and refrain from making high advance payments to music copyright holders to drive up competitors’ costs, etc.", "The Huya/DouYu prohibition decision is a timely reminder that China’s digital sector continues to be high on the regulatory agenda.", "Prohibiting a merger in the digital space for the first time also sends a powerful message that going forward, SAMR will closely scrutinise transactions in the digital economy under China’s merger control rules.", "However, the importance of the prohibition should not be overstated, as SAMR is expected to assess each case on its own merits and make decisions on a case-by-case basis.", "[1] See our previous client briefing on SAMR’s policy clarification on deals involving the VIE structure in December 2020.", "[2] For example, see our previous client briefings on the record-breaking antitrust fine levied against Alibaba, and China’s first antitrust guidelines for internet platforms, as well as the newsletter on the investigation into Meituan (an influential online food delivery platform in China).", "[3] See the 22 gun jumping decisions published by SAMR on 7 July 2021, in which Tencent was fined for acquiring 36.5% shares in Sogou in 2013 without notifying the deal to China’s antitrust authority.", "[4] SAMR expressly required un-notified VIE deals, which had met the filing threshold, to be reported to them in December 2020, as explained in our previous client briefing."]}

There’s a lot to it in 2021 too.", "First, a CDN is mandatory for many services and uses related to OTT:", "Secondly, video consumption is drastically increasing, and whether it’s SD, HD or 4K, live or VOD, if you want to have improved quality at a lower cost, you need a better CDN.", "If you need a refresher on CDNs, we suggest reading through the OTT series from the Broadcast Bridge including Evolving CDNs to improve OTT.", "And if we look at Asia – and it’s good to look at Asia for innovation — 5G, OTT, live streaming, IoT, the next generation CDN is already there.", "So, all over the world we’ll get better CDNs but this is not enough. We will also need Multi CDN, which is a method that uses multiple CDNs from different providers at the same time.", "This method is becoming common in the US, Europe and Asia but there‘s a lot to do worldwide. Multi CDN is very important to improve the quality of regular streaming, and it’s vital when it comes to lives sports, for example – for things like inserting stats and when low latency is an issue.", "And last but not least, the open framework WebRTC will keep growing. You could say that WebRTC is the equivalent of SRT but on the delivery side.", "Why is that? Because WebRTC helps achieve low latency, which is our next trend!", "With SRT streaming for acquisition, WebRTC for distribution, multi CDN, efficient codecs and 5G spreading, we’re good to go with ultra-low latency.", "OK, it’s a bit more complicated but it doesn’t change the fact that ultra-low latency will become more than required in 2021.", "First let’s make sure we’re on the same page regarding what latency is:", "Now, regarding the importance of latency, there are many reasons or use cases:", "– Live sports are switching from traditional pay-TV to OTT models", "– eSports keep rising and cloud gaming is starting to ramp up", "Ultra-low latency is becoming more important than ever and, that’s good news.", "You could argue that every piece of audio and video is data, so why a discussion on data?

the rate of growth of the Internet, online commerce, and cloud services, and the various factors detailed below.", "This guidance reflects our estimates as of February 2, 2021 regarding the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our operations, including those discussed above, and is highly dependent on numerous factors that we may not be able to predict or control, including: the duration and scope of the pandemic, including any recurrence; actions taken by governments, businesses, and individuals in response to the pandemic; the impact of the pandemic on global and regional economies and economic activity, workforce staffing and productivity, and our significant and continuing spending on employee safety measures; our ability to continue operations in affected areas; and consumer demand and spending patterns, as well as the effects on suppliers, creditors, and third-party sellers, all of which are uncertain.", "This guidance also assumes the impacts on consumer demand and spending patterns, including impacts due to concerns over the current economic outlook, will be in line with those experienced during the first quarter of 2021 to date, and the additional assumptions set forth below.", "However, it is not possible to determine the ultimate impact on our operations for the first quarter of 2021, or whether other currently unanticipated direct or indirect

will be available for at least three months at amazon.com/ir.", "This call will contain forward-looking statements and other material information regarding the Company’s financial and operating results.", "These forward-looking statements are inherently difficult to predict. Actual results could differ materially for a variety of reasons, including, in addition to the factors discussed above, the amount that Amazon.com invests in new business opportunities and the timing of those investments, the mix of products and services sold to customers, the mix of net sales derived from products as compared with services, the extent to which we owe income or other taxes, competition, management of growth, potential fluctuations in operating results, international growth and expansion, the outcomes of claims, litigation, government investigations, and other proceedings, fulfillment, sortation, delivery, and data center optimization, risks of inventory management, variability in demand, the degree to which the Company enters into, maintains, and develops commercial agreements, proposed and completed acquisitions and strategic transactions, payments risks, and risks of fulfillment throughput and productivity.", "Other risks and uncertainties include, among others, risks related to new products, services, and technologies, system interruptions, government regulation and taxation, and fraud.", "In addition, additional or unforeseen effects from the COVID-19 pandemic and the global economic climate may give rise to or amplify many of these risks.", "More information about factors that potentially could affect Amazon.com’s financial results is included in Amazon.com’s filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”), including its most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K and subsequent filings.", "Our investor relations website is amazon.com/ir and we encourage investors to use it as a way of easily finding information about us.", "We promptly make available on this website, free of charge, the reports that we file or furnish

A production executive may want to evaluate Atlanta, Georgia as a shooting location for a big budget fantasy epic, but we may not have much historical data about Atlanta.", "Furthermore, the mechanisms by which location impacts cost may be complex and difficult to infer from data, even in popular shooting locations.", "One solution is to lean heavily on domain knowledge and expertise. Rather than attempting to learn thousands of parameters in a black box, we carefully construct networks that reflect our intuition about the problem space, and place strong priors on any parameters we seek to learn.", "For instance, suppose our goal is to model the ratio R_XY in certain production costs between geographic locations X (Atlanta) and Y (New Orleans).", "There are hundreds of such costs for any given production, and some vary more with location than others.", "Despite the sparsity in the data, one can efficiently model the fractional change in each of these costs by organizing them hierarchically (illustrated in Figure 2), placing them in a model that reflects this hierarchy, and, finally, putting priors on these ratios that reflect domain expertise.", "Such a model allows production executives to play around with ‘what-if’ scenarios and make informed decisions about critical aspects of a production.", "Once the pre-production minefield of decisions has been navigated, next we get to tackle the challenge of putting a plan into action.", "This marks the start of the Production stage (Figure 1).

four international markets for their direct-to-consumer streaming launches in November 2019 (Ampere Analysis, 2019) presage continuing rapid foreign transformational impact on the local television space.", "Netflix’s disruption of the subscription model in Australian TV has seen the pay-TV sector sufficiently challenged for the monopoly service, Foxtel, to be forced to unbundle and rebrand as a multiplatform service (McDonnell, 2019).", "Constantly pivoting to stay viable despite persistently static reach figures, it has integrated Netflix into an ‘all in one place’ offer, ‘The New Foxtel Experience’.", "Netflix’s success is a testament to the power of the company’s brand – the fastest-growing US brand in 2019 (Spangler, 2019a) – and to a range of consumer or demand-side factors, including a high-quality user experience (Spangler, 2019b), a relatively consistent price point that starts competitively low (Masige, 2019), the entrenchment of the service into our lexicon (Rickett, 2015) and popular conceptions of viewing (‘Netflix and chill’), and an overarching emphasis on exclusive original programming and regular content acquisitions that are often touted as innovating in screen content (e.g. Black Mirror: Bandersnatch, The Irishman), created in part for a ‘lost generation’ of Millennial and younger viewers (Brownlow as cited by Cunningham, 2018/19).", "Critical media scholar Graeme Turner (2018) has written strongly about the ‘game changer’ that is Netflix’s reconfiguration of the Australian television market.", "To be sure, the markets into which Netflix has penetrated deepest are mostly the Anglosphere, where the acceptance of what remains still a largely English-language, US-dominated offer, is highest (Ampere Analysis, 2019).", "But it also points to fundamental weaknesses in the Australian television system and ‘pent up’ demand (about a quarter of a million VPN-based Netflix users before launch in 2015 (Lobato and Ewing, 2014) in the context of

to consumers (providing a high-quality user experience) that can be scaled rapidly with a minimum commitment to the sunk costs of hard infrastructure assets.", "Turner (2019a, 2019b) is also right to point to these remarkable consumption phenomena throwing down the challenge to scholarship to reengage with audience studies and ‘cultures of use’, thus casting some light, beyond clumsy clichés like binge viewing, on what is driving such change at the household level.", "The ‘Netflix effect’, Turner (2019a: 223) argues, requires nothing less than the ‘need to reconsider the adequacy of the currently preferred methodologies for analysing media consumption’.", "The call for this kind of research is especially pertinent as another key page in the Silicon Valley playbook is to establish unacceptably high levels of information asymmetry, releasing very little consumption data, even to their partner producers.", "One thing such change may be seen to have challenged – but we would argue has not undermined – is the propensity Australian audiences have to consume Australian content.", "The ‘Hollywood + Australian content’ strategy of the Australian-based and Australian-owned streamer Stan, as described by CEO Mike Sneesby (2019), has seen them establish a significant foothold in the local market, reaching an estimated 3.7 million Australians (Roy Morgan, 2020) from a base of 1.8 million subscriptions (Meade, 2020).", "While Stan will never compete with the brand power of Netflix, its consistent growth, partnerships with traditional US distributors, and an emphasis on local production have defied initial expectations of the local broadcaster-owned SVOD, upon which Nine is increasingly relying to ride out this period of radical market uncertainty (Mediaweek, 2020).", "It appears that Stan’s latest strategy to respond to the entry of Apple TV+ and Disney+ (with the consequent loss of significant content packages) has been to lean into ‘homegrown’ branding even further.", "Recent advertising has Stan describing itself as ‘Australia’s unrivalled home of original productions’ (Stan Australia, 2019), a title confirmed by the fact that while Australian content in the Netflix AU catalogue has remained at or below 2% since its launch, local titles have made up 9%–11% of Stan’s library since 2017 (Lobato and Scarlata, 2019).", "One potentially useful response to Turner’s call for a ‘cultures of use’ approach, in the absence of at least a beginning point with audience data and, as Turner notes, no extant Australian qualitative academic studies, is to look at how professional reviewers are shaping Australian consumption of SVOD content.", "Cultural blind spots: Australian originals on Netflix and Stan", "Perhaps the most culturally intriguing of all the impacts of multinational streaming services on the Australian screen ecology is the local struggle to understand, not to say appreciate, the new dynamics of internationalisation.", "Netflix’s cultural profile as a foreign, specifically American, entity is starkly clear in the analytical frames being used by professional reviewers looking to make sense of the corpuses of Australian originals being produced by Netflix and its main local competitor, Stan.", "Cultural criticism and reviewing of these corpuses display a resumption of the old opposition between Dermody and Jacka’s (1987) ‘discourses of nationalism’ and ‘discourses of internationalism’.", "Whereas Stan’s Australian originals are reviewed as familiar extensions of well-understood local genres and routines of representation, Netflix’s major commissions so far, Pine Gap, Tidelands and Lunatics, have been met with bemusement, befuddlement and excoriation.", "The critical response to Stan’s originals has been almost uniformly warm and supportive, even gushing.", "Their comedy series – No Activity and The Other Guy – were overwhelmingly described as familiar, but fresh.", "Largely improvised No Activity was a ‘sly delight’ that delivered ‘Australian farce at its finest’ (Bastow, 2016).", "The Other Guy, a semi-autobiographical comedy-drama starring comedian Matt Okine and ‘distinctly set in Sydney’s inner west’

graveyard for the sitcoms of yesteryear’ (Burke, 2015).", "Stan’s first forays into original television drama benefitted significantly from local familiarity with their well-established and popular film source material.", "The series adaptation of Wolf Creek was considered a ‘very Australian example of the horror genre’ (Burke, 2017), that looked ‘like a million blood-stained bucks’ and boasted ‘considerable gnarly thrills’ (Buckmaster, 2016).", "The remake of the 1990s classic Romper Stomper premiered on New Year’s Day 2018 and was deemed a timely and accurate representation of the times; a

(CGI-enhanced shots) of Sydney, we are forced to contemplate how our own communities and cities might look going forward’.", "The ‘character-driven and moody Tasmanian noir’ The Gloaming apparently offered ‘an aesthetic so eye-watering it makes plaudits such as “evocative” or “painterly” seem manifestly inadequate’ (Buckmaster, 2019c).", "The show was lauded as the kind of ‘ambitious’ and ‘gutsy’ Australian series being largely abandoned by commercial free-to-air networks (Ma, 2020).", "Stan also made a ‘hefty investment’ (Groves, 2020) in Justin Kurzel’s True History of the Kelly Gang to secure the feature for release on the streaming service on Australia Day 2020, after a limited cinema window.", "While the accuracy of the film’s portrayal of the legendary Australian bushranger was called into question (Gaunson, 2020), Stan benefitted from the publicity generated by its international cast, Toronto Film Festival premiere and the largely positive critical reception, both locally (Boyd, 2020; Bradshaw, 2019; Galea, 2020) and internationally (Lodge, 2019; Rooney, 2019).", "In stark contrast, reviewers have struggled to productively come to grips with Netflix’s Australian originals.", "The commissioning of the ABC/Netflix co-production Pine Gap saw high hopes that this ‘timely’ thriller (Idato, 2017) based on a concept ‘shrouded in intrigue for many Australians’ would be ‘just the beginning’ of a slate of new content production (Slessor and Bogle, 2018).", "However, upon release, it was thoroughly panned. Buckmaster (2018a) described it as ‘less a spy drama than an attempt to cure insomnia’ and awarded it a solitary star.", "LaMarco (2018) lamented that while the setting is a ‘unique one and could be interesting to American audiences not familiar with the territory’, that is where the reasons to watch the ‘dull and sluggish attempt at a thriller’ end.", "Razer (2018) wrote that Pine Gap was flagrant propaganda of the ‘state-approved sentiment we see on ABC TV news constantly: China is “inscrutable”; the US is imperfect but basically decent; Muslim terrorists are the very worst kind of terrorist.", "Oh, and this old favourite: Aboriginal people are deeply spiritual’. With its ‘laborious exposition’ and lazy dialogue, it insulted in its representations (Razer, 2018).", "The response to Netflix’s first fully commissioned Australian original, Tidelands, was largely befuddlement, and witnessed the recrudescence of the cultural cringe.", "‘Tidelands is an embarrassing mess’ and ‘not the show Australia deserves to represent us on the US streaming service’, wrote (Ma, 2018).", "While the supernatural crime thriller was undeniably pretty – ‘all sun-kissed glistening bodies and perfect beach hair’ – Ma deemed the plot confusing, the writing weak, the performances lightweight, and the show ‘strangely boring’ overall (2018).", "The Conversation found the series ‘contains many narratives’ and as a result suffers from ‘something of an identity crisis …", "The result is a tangled confusion of storylines … [where] nudity and sex are used as temporary resolutions to sub-plots, distracting from more major plotlines’ (Turner, 2018a).", "Fairfax reviewer Houston (2018), in classical cringe mode, began her review with ‘What will the international audience for whom it’s clearly intended make of Tidelands?’.", "However, this response was measured when compared with the critical vitriol Chris Lilley’s Netflix original, Lunatics, attracted.", "Lilley’s satire is perennially controversial and attracts inevitable backlash. Lunatics’ use of blackface saw some fans cancel their subscriptions (Nsenduluka, 2019) and take to Twitter to boycott the streaming platform (Powell, 2019) and ultimately, in the light of 2020’s huge upswell of Black Lives Matter protests, saw Netflix withdraw all four of Lilley’s shows from its Australian catalogue (Boseley, 2020).", "But it should also be noted that the series rated highly with audiences in Australia according to Netflix’s end of year most popular lists.", "Locally, it ranked fifth in the top 10 most popular releases of 2019 and second in the list of most popular series (White and Kanter, 2019).", "Lilley’s first series in almost 5 years was met with critical indifference – ‘the worst reaction you could elicit in comedy’ (Ma, 2019b) – and excoriation.", "For Ma, it wasn’t just that he hadn’t moved on from the ‘same schtick’ that brought him early acclaim.", "Instead, with Lunatics he seemed to have ‘less insight and discipline’, the freedom of Netflix’s episode lengths facilitating ‘fundamental structural issues’, with ‘sprawling’ sketches that ‘overstayed their welcome’ (Ma, 2019b).", "Heritage (2019) concluded that ‘the problem isn’t that the series is cruel … It’s that it is boring. The trick has stopped working.", "The whole thing just feels rote’. Buckmaster doubled down: he considered Lilley and his humour ‘a relic from an older, more primitive time’, and questioned the SVOD’s decision to commission the series: ‘Just when it appeared no TV network in Australia would work with him again, along came Netflix (talk about not reading the room) …", "Lunatics is a disaster: not just unfunny and problematic, but boring and utterly unrelenting’ (2019a).", "Of course, de gustibus non est disputandum – you can’t argue with taste. Maybe it just so happens that all these Netflix originals are just awful and all of Stan’s work is simply outstanding.", "And tomorrow it will all turn around because new work will change the evidence base. But one fundamental thing cultural studies has taught us is that taste is socially and culturally constructed and reproduced, so we will proceed to interpret this evidence base as a social and cultural construct that goes to the heart of how Australian industry, culture, consumers and policy respond to new forms of internationalisation presented by the operations of Netflix in Australia.", "The remarkably different cultural assumptions in the reviewing of these two bodies of work reflect old, powerful discourses of ‘good’ nationalism versus ‘bad’ internationalism that date from the 1970s.", "Susan Dermody and Elizabeth Jacka (1987), seeking to account for the dynamic conflictual structure of the renascent Australian film industry in the 1970s and 1980s, contrasted Industries 1 (culturally specific) and 2 (blandly international).", "This foundational analysis has been partially contemporised by Deb Verhoeven (2014). She argued that, since the 1980s, ‘Industry 3’ (filmmaking that is both national and international) and ‘Industry 4’ have emerged.", "Industry 4 is ‘characterised by the adoption of new methodologies for producing and distributing content afforded by the digitisation of the screen industries’ (p. 163).", "Some of the characteristics of Verhoeven’s Industry 4 presage the impact of SVODs, especially her delineation of ‘global niche audiences’ ‘defined by interest rather than geo-political allegiance’.", "Both her Industry 3 and 4 declare a strong realignment of the national–international opposition (p. 164).", "The radically different critical response to Stan’s and Netflix’s originals belies the reality that Netflix’s internationalism cannot be read through the old binaries of Industries 1 and 2, while it also exemplifies a form of Industry 4.", "Nor can it be put down to Stan simply commissioning better quality product. Producers of Netflix’s originals (such as Screentime and Hoodlum) are experienced and indeed industry leaders.", "And it cannot only be attributed to Netflix’s global, and Stan’s local, audience either – Stan’s originals have been aggressively and quite successfully sold into multiple international markets on the traditional model of first release locally, then sell internationally.", "Whether Netflix fully funds or co-funds its ‘Originals’ (Ball, 2018), its investment decisions are always based on a multiple-territory strategy.", "It invests in content produced to occupy verticals, or genres, such as millennial supernaturalism (Tidelands) – which Netflix may not have invented but has done much to popularise globally – or very edgy or controversial comedy (Lunatics).", "There is a thriving genre of Netflix originals that trade on international political and conspiracy dramas, into which Pine Gap fits neatly.", "These genre categories appeal to transnational audience cohorts that could never be restricted to a single market for them to be a viable commission.", "Netflix’s internationalism in these instances is not about so-called ‘runaway’ production – pretending that the locations are somewhere else.", "Nor does it look like international co-production, where typically the storylines are designed to take characters from country to country to appeal to audiences in specific locales and satisfy multiple national funding agencies.", "Netflix’s internationalism is not concerned with downplaying Australianness; indeed, it can double down on it when it suits the marketability of the content.", "Some of Tidelands’ marketing showcased Queensland in ‘all its striking coastal and inland glory’ (Hoodlum principal Nathan Mayfield, as cited in Enker, 2018).", "While strong tourism outcomes were central to the financial support of Screen Queensland (2017), the ‘spectacle’ of the Moreton Bay region was enthusiastically embraced by Netflix as well.", "(Its featurette, ‘Welcome to Orphelin Bay’ – released as part of the show’s advertising campaign – appears, for the most part, like a tourism ad.)", "Netflix also offers significant international exposure opportunities for content and performers whose material would be unlikely to appear on broadcast television (the best Australian example is Hannah Gadsby’s Nanette and Douglas).", "Indeed, Anna Potter (2018) even argues that Netflix’s kids’ product is sometimes more Australian than local broadcaster-commissioned product.", "Given the warm embrace extended by Australian consumers to multinational SVODs, stark in comparison with the cold shoulder shown to Netflix by professional reviewers, it is important to stress the cultural innovation and industry stimulus that disruptive forces such as Netflix have visited on production environments, including Australia’s.", "In general, international SVODs have provided another distribution and funding source; picked up and revived series dumped by broadcasters (Blackiston, 2019a); strengthened or reinvented genres (e.g. anime, horror, sci-fi, genres often addressed to teenage viewers); addressed underserved demographics, particularly Millennials; contributed to more cosmopolitan popular culture consumption; and provided a global platform for niche interests which would rarely get through broadcaster gatekeepers.", "As Lotz (2020) has shown, Netflix’s fundamental strategy is to transact with multinational subscribers to pursue distinctive content strategies, in particular, programming for taste clusters too small to effectively form a viable market for services limited by national reach or nation-based audience evaluation.", "For the production industry, SVOD services have provided new funding opportunities. The Screen Australia Drama Report (2019) Drama Report shows that, in 2017–2018 and 2018–2019, investment in drama programmes first released online equalled or surpassed those on pay-TV.", "It is important to contextualise spending on titles that have premiered online. This still constitutes a relatively small slice of the overall production pie, and for Screen Australia’s purposes includes content first released on all forms of online video-on-demand (Broadcast (BVOD), Advertising (AVOD) and Transactional (TVOD), as well as SVOD).", "This should be contrasted with the startling claim from the Motion Picture Association (MPA), which represents Disney, Netflix, Paramount, Sony, Universal and Warner Bros in the Asia-Pacific region, that SVOD commissions or co-productions in Australia ‘already exceed the investment in original drama made by commercial broadcasters without being required to do so by regulation’ (Fernandes, 2019: 3).", "This problematically includes any local production or co-production that has graced an SVOD in some capacity both here and abroad.", "However, it is important to acknowledge that budgets for international SVOD commissions are significantly higher than what producers can expect in the massively constrained local environment threatened by broadcasters’ haemorrhaging of advertising revenue and – yes – the migration of eyeballs to SVODs.", "It also throws an ironic light on Minister Fletcher’s (2020) allusion that new quality benchmarks have been established by SVODs.", "Significantly higher budgets are very attractive to those who receive them, although that also means that cost structures across the industry can rise.", "But perhaps, by volume, the most significant production stimulus that the arrival of foreign SVODs has caused has been Fairfax/Nine’s (now Nine) pre-emptive response to the imminent arrival of Netflix – the establishment of Stan.", "Stan was the first streaming platform to commission a locally produced television series (No Activity, 2015).", "Stan’s catalogue now contains 17 locally produced originals: two feature films, nine television series/specials and six stand-up comedy specials.", "Despite the fact that a large part of their annual AU$55 million originals production budget comes from international distribution (Sneesby, 2019), Stan claims that their titles are being produced with a specifically Australian audience in mind (Duke, 2018); that the business has furthered itself in Australia by filling the gaps left by multinational SVODs (Sneesby as cited in Blackiston, 2019b).", "Since 2018, partnerships with Victorian and Queensland state screening bodies on drama and comedy development funds have sought to unearth new local writing talent and support practitioners at all stages of production.", "This traditional developmental model contrasts with Netflix’s propensity to contract only with experienced producers.", "Opportunity and threat come hand in hand for producers. Significantly higher budgets offered by multinational SVODs come with business practices shared with other Silicon Valley platforms: a ‘black box’ approach to deal structures and data, raising issues of transparency, accountability, fairness and terms of trade.", "Nondisclosure agreements, extremely selective data release and reports of a take it or leave it approach to negotiating deal structures make Netflix – despite its significant innovations and considerable commitment to quality production expenditure – a potentially bad actor in the screen production industry.", "But perhaps the greatest Faustian bargain is the one that suggests that, without regulatory reform, the more producers sign with SVODs, the more they may unintentionally weaken the current settlement around Australian content regulation.", "The production industry depends on a stable regulatory environment focussed on the so-called ‘market failure’ genres that are most vulnerable to substitution because of their cost.", "It is very important to note that there is a natural fit between SVOD key genres and the core market failure genres that key commercial TV content regulation is directed at: quality scripted drama, comedy, kids and documentary.", "Netflix specialises in these genres (as to varying degrees do other multinational SVODs), while free to air broadcasting is increasingly specialising in light entertainment and reality, with YouTube the place for user-generated arts, performance and music (AlphaBeta, 2016).", "The substitution effect of the increased consumption of these genres on SVOD services means that, if there is no move to incorporate SVODs into the regulatory framework, the disparity between domestic incumbents’ regulatory burden and SVODs will grow and will strengthen the pressure brought to bear on the policy system and government by broadcasters and pay-TV for deregulation.", "The regulatory pressures have now come to a head. The remarkably rapid uptake of Netflix has added to the financial and viewership woes of the commercial broadcasters, which most recently have been assailed on the advertising side by Google and Facebook, and on the attention economy side by the SVODs.", "Tim Worner, the then-head of leading network Seven, might have looked quixotic in 2018 in trying to tie a crisis in entertainment for the commercial broadcasters to the crisis in journalism, appealing to the competition regulator to include entertainment in its remit in the recent Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) Digital Platforms Inquiry (Seven West Media, 2018).", "The commercial networks have been protected and assisted by government in successive waves over decades.", "From a consumer and political perspective, they may be too central to everyday life to fail. Government has mandated that the ACMA cannot grant more than three commercial broadcast licences.", "In 2017, their licence fees were abolished and replaced with reduced spectrum usage fees. Anti-syphoning rules protect their access to premium sport.", "They can acquit Australian content obligations using New Zealand content. Until now, though, governments have broadly held the line on Australian content regulation.", "That changed, dramatically, in April 2020. COVID-19 has been the spur for the Morrison government to ‘temporarily’ suspend the market failure genre regulations (while retaining the so-called transmission quota).", "The move is uncomfortably close to Seven West Media’s call on the federal government to take ‘immediate action’ and abandon local content quotas.", "Following a AU$66 million half-year loss at the end of 2019, the broadcaster revealed their plan to breach their licencing requirements in 2021 by halting the ‘unsustainable’ production of local children’s content that is ‘further handicap[ping them] against unregulated, foreign digital platforms’ (Samios and Hunter, 2020).", "SVOD success is the latest factor leeching the lifeblood out of the regulations protecting the market failure genre.", "Nine Entertainment announced AU$100 million in cuts to their broadcast service, intending to concentrate on the content that is proving more profitable in the digital era – namely, sport, news, current affairs and local reality (Meade, 2020).", "The matter of regulating SVOD services is vexed. Such services were established in various countries, including Australia, not as television services but as telecommunications services.", "They were, and are, therefore, not subject to any of the content regulations that apply to commercial media.", "There is an additional background complexity to the situation in Australia: the Australia United States Free Trade Agreement (AUSFTA).", "While most expert opinion agrees that there is some scope within the AUSFTA for contemplating the application of Australian content requirements on what were called, when the agreement was settled back in 2004, ‘interactive audio and/or video services’, the political stakes of inviting a US trade backlash would be high.", "But the issue of SVOD services sitting outside content regulation is changing. In 2018, the European Parliament updated regulation to require 30% of the catalogue of SVOD services on member countries to be European content.", "One of the most assertive regulatory actors in the EU, Germany, requires streaming services to contribute 2.5% of their revenue to the country’s subsidy system to support German production (Roxborough, 2018).", "In Canada, a root and branch, holistic review of the broadcasting and telecommunications legislative frameworks has in January 2020 brought down its final report addressing reform principles (Broadcasting and Telecommunications Legislative Review Panel (BTLRP), 2020).", "This report has the virtue of having had to build from first principles the rationale for broadcasting and telecommunications reform.", "This is in contrast to EU actions which, having already developed extensive regulatory architecture applicable and in action in relation to the major US platforms, is extending and adapting rather than starting afresh, as Canada’s Communications Future:", "Time to Act is. It proposes to radically cut through decades of policy distinctions and exclusions in asserting that", "This new model would bring all those providing media content services to Canadians – whether online or through conventional means, whether foreign or domestic, whether or not they have a place of business in Canada – within the scope of the Broadcasting Act and under the jurisdiction of the CRTC.", "While maintaining flexibility as to the level of contribution, it includes every entity in an omnibus undertaking: ‘We recommend that all media content undertakings that benefit from the Canadian media communications sector contribute to it in an equitable manner:", "Undertakings that carry out like activities should have like obligations, regardless of where they are located’ (BTLRP, 2020: 143).", "This includes: curation (Prime Video, Netflix, Spotify and Canadian entities); aggregation (cable cos, MSN News, Google News and Apple News) and sharing (YouTube and Facebook).", "In Australia, the situation is fluid and complex. Before COVID-19, there had been policy stasis for years.", "However, what had happened was the extension of the Location and Post, Digital and Visual Effects (PDV) Offsets to SVOD services (Fifield, 2019) to complement the already available Producer Offset and the 4-year AU$140 million Location Incentive available from July 2019.", "This was a potentially substantial ‘carrot’ that could precede at least a threatened regulatory ‘stick’.", "Both Netflix and Apple utilised the extension within months, bringing their respective Shantaram and Clickbait productions to film in Victoria (Film Victoria, 2019a, 2019b).", "Some of the complexity of the regulatory challenge is seen when we consider that the ACCC Digital Platforms Inquiry is a 600+ page report setting an international gold standard of what assertive national jurisdictions could or should do when faced with the major social (including privacy), competition and public interest issues which particularly Google and Facebook pose for society and traditional media.", "There is nothing explicit in the report on SVODs, and only three mentions of Netflix – none of them in any way substantive.", "But it has been used not only to move to threaten mandatory ‘terms of trade’ between news media and Google and Facebook, but as a trigger for ramping up the significance of the cultural issue of sustainability of Australian and children’s content on screen media using the report’s recommendation for a ‘harmonised framework’ for media reform – even though this recommendation (Rec 6; ACCC, 2019: 15) contains nothing directly to do with SVOD services.", "This would suggest that the government’s strategy is to transfer the high level of now-near global advocacy for reigning in the influence of the two major platforms in the social, competition and public interest fields and apply it to the cultural field to regulate SVOD services.", "‘Regulated free-to-air broadcasters are competing with unregulated digital platforms and video streaming services.", "It has been evident for some time – and the COVID-19 crisis has made it even more obvious – that this is not sustainable’, the communications minister recently noted (Fletcher as cited by Karp, 2020).", "‘These arrangements threaten the sustainability of television broadcasters – and in turn the sustainability of the film and television content production sector’.", "Government threatens ‘unregulated digital platforms and video streaming services’, but all the actions so far have been to deregulate and subsidise commercial broadcasters, now faced with a major acceleration of their loss of advertising base, and eyeballs to the streamers.", "The test will be whether anything on the side of regulating ‘unregulated digital platforms and video streaming services’ will arise from the fast-track options paper (ACMA and Screen Australia, 2020), apart from more help to commercial broadcasters.", "The Options Paper lays out four options: no change, minimal, significant and deregulation. It will be a test of local production industry advocacy to move the dial away from the government’s (hitherto incremental) deregulatory bent.", "The situation going forward is complex because powerful local media with predominant interests in news and information want heavy, experimental, first-in-the-world regulation of Google and Facebook and the government has promised it: the development by the ACCC of a mandatory code requiring these two platforms to share advertising revenues with news media companies for content they created which the platforms are distributing.", "On the other hand, local media with predominant interests in entertainment (there are of course crossovers between the two) want radical deregulation of their Australian content obligations, and the government is ‘temporarily’ trialling it.", "If there is to be a future for Australian content regulation on commercial television services, there has to be some parity established, with the imposition on international SVOD services of minimum Australian content requirements as well as facilitation of its discoverability.", "That is what is happening in Europe and Canada. That is what should happen here.", "We have offered a ‘screen-ecological’ approach that attempts to grasp the cultural and industrial dynamics on both the supply (production and business strategy) and demand (consumption) sides of the impact of multinational SVOD services in Australia.", "Such an approach emphasises the complex, conflictual and interdependent factors that must be taken into consideration in any holistic assessment of Netflix (and other multinational SVODs) in the Australian screen ecology.", "A stalled policy response to the challenge of unregulated SVOD services has been mightily shaken up when the government, under crisis conditions sparked by the global pandemic, ‘temporarily’ suspended Australian content regulations, versions of which have been in place since the 1960s.", "Netflix’s model of internationalisation is very different from previous models media scholars and policy makers are used to.", "If we do not learn how to read and respond to Netflix’s model of internationalisation productively, it will have implications for both the maximisation of opportunities for the production industry out of the presence of international streamers in Australia, and for wider community support for incentives for, and potential future regulation of, the streamers here now and yet to arrive.", "Funding: The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: ARC Discovery DP190100978 Internet-Distributed Television: Cultural, Industrial and Policy Dynamics, chief investigators Ramon Lobato, Amanda Lotz, Stuart Cunningham.", "ORCID iD: Stuart Cunningham https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7437-1424", "Stuart Cunningham, Queensland University of Technology, Australia.", "Alexa Scarlata, RMIT University, Australia; University of Melbourne, Australia.", "- ACCC (2019) Digital platforms inquiry – final report.

Now they’ve released for both film and TV across three lists in their most prominent territories.", "Sure, Netflix doesn’t give us much to work with, but I’ll interrogate these numbers to death in the meantime.", "Before the analysis, though, some facts to keep in mind. Whenever you see data, you should ask the “5Ws” of journalism.", "Most problems with data come from folks measuring it differently.

I’ll focus on the US, but they released it for a few major territories.", "– How: Separated into content types, with all releases, by film/TV, scripted vs documentary.", "Here’s a chart, with some additional details of the Top 10 Movies:", "Thought 1: If this is the best “datecdote” Netflix could offer, that’s not great", "Really, that’s what you think when you see a list that specifically changes the criteria from their previously announced metrics.", "Netflix had spent all of 2019 giving investors the “70% completion” metric for all their datecdotes. For this release, they dropped it down to “2 minutes of viewing completion”metric.", "Using our iceberg principal above, what would the 70% threshold have told us that Netflix didn’t want to know?", "There’s clearly a narrative they’re deliberately trying to avoid.", "Further, why not give us the “most binged” shows again as they did in 2018? Whenever someone changes the data goal posts, you should be very cautious.", "Yes, you see this all the time in Hollywood when development execs want to greenlight a project.

If leaders don’t like the numbers, change the measurements.", "Thought 2: This new metric doesn’t tie to Netflix’s self-stated goal for monetization.", "If you’re looking for more red flags, this is it. In the last earnings call, CEO Reed Hastings said they care more about time on site than anything else.", "So why not give us that? They have the hours viewed data…they even could have limited it to new releases.", "(Which would have excluded Avengers: Infinity War, Black Panther, Friends and The Office.)

When Netflix execs speak at conferences, they downplay traditional viewership to focus on how well films bring subscribers to the platform, or keep them there.", "Clearly completed films would correlate more with sign-ups than only 2 minutes of viewing.

Let’s start with kids content. Kids rewatch the most content.", "They don’t watch The Incredibles 2 once, they watch it a dozen times. That gives kids films an edge on viewership hours.", "Narratively, you don’t want to emphasize how valuable kids content is right after Disney+ launched. As Richard Rushfield has written, something like 60-70% of Netflix viewing may be on “family titles”.", "It also means that if hours on site are the key metric—again as Hastings said in the last earnings call—then kids content seems even more valuable.", "Netflix also likely avoided the 70% completion metric because they wanted to downplay licensed content as much as possible.", "Netflix films have a dramatic marketing edge because when new seasons premiere, they get home page, search engine tinkering and top of screen treatment.", "This doesn’t necessarily drive completions—if shows aren’t good people don’t finish them—but it does drive 2 minute sampling.", "Still some licensed content made the list, even as it was deliberately curated out. Specifically, three of the top ten films and one of the top ten series.", "I’d argue this is bad for Netflix; even as they tried to weed out licensed titles a few prominent Disney films made the list.", "This is more impressive than it seems because the biggest Disney films weren’t even released in 2019.", "Specifically, Black Panther and Avengers: Infinity War were 2018 releases. Meanwhile, Netflix was stuck with The Ant-Man and the Wasp—one of the lower grossing recent MCU films—and Solo: A Star War Story.", "Then the rest of the incredible Disney 2019 slate didn’t make it onto Netflix.", "Thought 5: Focusing on 28 days ignores films and shows with longer legs.", "Licensed titles, especially big blockbuster films, also have longer legs than new releases. Don’t you think Avengers: Infinity War had some rewatching going on in the run up to Avengers:", "Endgame’s release? Absolutely. By focusing on 28 days as the time period, it narrows the window for licensed films to rack up viewership.", "(They also had a fairly crowded January 2019, with three Disney feature films being released in the same month.)", "Thought 6: International Originals Still don’t play in the United States.", "This might be the most important insight. Because it throws some cold water on this commonly repeated narrative in the media.", "As far as I can tell, we still don’t have any data that Netflix’s international originals play well in the United States.", "Not a single title originated outside the United States or was a non-English film/TV seres. The closest was The Witcher, that’s based on a Polish book series.", "In fact, perusing the international lists, they look perfectly ordinary. Which is pretty sub-optimal for Netflix.", "Netflix prides itself on paying more than anyone else because they buy global rights. This strategy only works if you can make money (which means drives subscriptions) in those new territories.", "And viewership is highly correlated with subscriptions.", "Thus, If Indians don’t watch French films, if no one outside south Asia watches Indian originals, and if only some American films travel, then Netflix shouldn’t pay global rights for all those titles.", "(I’ll have more to say on this in future articles.)", "Thought 7: Netflix TV shows don’t grow season-to-season and", "I’ve written about this before, but Netflix data shows us the difficulty of sustaining audiences long term for TV series.", "It’s fairly easy for series to launch well, but then drop off quickly. From the initial data, it doesn’t look like Netflix has an advantage in driving season-to-season retention, and it might actually be worse than traditional networks and cable channels.", "In this data release, only 3 TV series in season 2 or beyond made it on the list. When you’d actually expect popular series to have an advantage in getting the most subscribers.", "The most notable omission in 2019? Orange is the New Black, whose final season didn’t make the list.", "Thought 8: Some films are started, but not finished.", "Specifically, the mysteries on the list are why certain films landed above others, when we know their actual 70% completion rate.", "Specifically, The Irishman had more initial viewers than Triple Frontier, but Ted Sarandos said it was only tracking for a 40 million completion rate through 28 days.", "(With about 16 days of data when he announced that, that 40 million estimate is fairly reliable.)", "Or take Extremely Wicked, Shockingly Evil and Vile. It never got the datecdote treatment, but it showed up on this list.", "Arguably, this list is more about marketing than the quality of the film.", "That would seem to be the implication of 6 Underground, The Irishman, You season 2 and The Witcher all making the top 5 on these lists.", "Given that December is a historically good month for Netflix—people buy new devices/smart TVs and fire up Netflix—this is still a good performance.", "My “think” caveat, though, stems from the fact that otherwise the films and TV series are spread out between all the quarters.", "Q2 had the most films/series on the list with 6, but the lowest was Q3 which still had 4."]}

Understanding this, we could say that Netflix is fully aware of the consequences and choosing to raise prices for clear strategic reasons, and leave the debate at that.", "If we wanted to “trust in Netflix”, we’d say they know what they are doing and leave it at that. That said, as Kevin Drum recently wrote, we should never just believe companies.", "Moreover, even successful companies make awful decisions.

By finally getting control of losses (holding steady at $3 billion) Wall Street will likely stay on the Netflix bandwagon.", "If losses had increased to $4 billion, would investors have the same patience?

Consider this the analysis of the data set before us, and it applies to everyone, including people at the company.", "First, this is a classic “small sample size” problem.", "Frankly, Netflix doesn’t have as a large of a sample size for their economists to leverage as I made it appear above.", "Sure, each year gives you a quarterly subscriber number. So 2008-2018 is 11 years by 4 quarters, or a sample size of 44.", "Except, the initial growth really isn’t representative. They transitioned a lot of people over from DVDs.", "We could look at monthly data, which would multiply it by 12, but that’s probably too granular for how often Netflix changes prices.", "If we just went by price changes we are at a sample size below ten. So no matter what model you build, you won’t have a lot of data to leverage.", "Second, there are multiple variables to consider, in addition to price.", "The problem with those fancy models is they may not have priced in the value of all that content correctly.", "If the model makes the assumption, “We can replace Disney/Warner streaming content with originals” and it turns out their originals aren’t popular with people (though still popular with critics), then the double whammy of price increases and content loss could lead to a drop out.", "Moreover, new services are entering that will compete for share of wallet. All these factors should work together to make us very uncertain here.", "So for everyone—myself included—who is willing to make a prediction: don’t! Or do so with a huge grain of salt.", "Your “90% confidence interval”—hat tip to Kahneman, Tversky, and OB professors everywhere—should be really large.", "Again, if the goal is to make a prediction that is right 9 times out of ten, then make the range very large.", "I have two. First, many of the people debating this on Twitter will not actually make a quantified prediction.", "They will say something like, “This price increase will not materially effect Netflix’s subscriber growth.”", "With a prediction like that, nothing is quantified. Even if they are wrong, how could I prove it? There is so much wiggle room they could easily debate the facts.", "Still, I think we’re smarter when we at least try to quantify our predictions. It forces us to think through the issues.", "So as foolish as it may be, I’m going to make a prediction. For the upper range, Netflix saw a real world subscriber increase of 11% in 2018.", "It was 10% the year before that, so I’m making 10% my upper interval on my prediction. In other words, I see a best case scenario where the price increase doesn’t hurt subscriber growth.", "For the floor, this is tougher. And this is where I worry about being too confident in my prediction.", "Again, it is very, very hard to be right 90% of the time. We’re often too over-confident. So I can see an upper growth of 10%, but if the price increase back fires, along with all the content leaving, I could see a scenario where Netflix loses 10% of their customer base.", "Yikes, that sounds high, but again I want to be right 9 times out of 10 here. Here’s a table with potential % drop out rates to judge for yourself:", "Now to the prediction itself. Assuming a 80% MAU rate (on the high end of my range), with a 10% “willing to drop out” gives me 2% growth.", "That sounds right and gets me right to about 60 million customers. So there you have that prediction.", "Prediction: 2% growth in subscribers, up to 60 million customers at the end of 2019.", "90% Confidence Interval: 52.6-64.3 million customers in the end of 2019.

After I refreshed myself on the Bass model two weeks ago, one of the first things I did was apply the model to the Netflix data to see if it still fit my professor’s prediction.", "Guess what? It did. Here’s my initial take for all Netflix subscribers going back to launch. I ended up with about a total market size of 64 million.", "The question is, how accurate is that? Glad you asked. When it comes to values versus actuals, I’ve always liked “mean absolute percentage error” (MAPE).", "This is basically the mean average for the percentage that the actuals are off of the predicted result.", "(See, this is math-y.) In this case, the average error was off about 14.3% by eyeballing the Bass Diffusion model.", "But I’ll be honest, when I remembered to calculate the MAPE, a light bulb went off. This was my “a ha” moment from two weeks back.", "If I had the MAPE, I could use an Excel tool to make calculate the Bass curves for me, instead of me playing around with the numbers.", "One of the core tools of “operations research” (sometimes called “management science”), is (second math alert!)", "linear programming. This is, I’ll concede, complex stuff. But basically, a linear programming model is a set of equations that the computer can solve to optimize (maximize or minimize) for a given value.", "That’s basically what I did here. I took the Bass Diffusion model, and put it into Solver. I optimized for the MAPE, trying to minimize the error.", "This is what Solver was built for. I couldn’t get the “Simplex LP” to work and had to use “GRG Non-Linear”.", "I’m not a math PhD, but I think the fact I’m working with a differential equation invalidates the linear programming.", "The next challenge is figuring out the total market size. To use Bass, you need to know the eventual market size, and find the p and q from that.", "We’re going a bit backwards here. In the eyeball case, I played with numbers and 64 million seemed to fit.", "To be more rigorous, though, I’ll run through the all the numbers between 60-90 million subscriber, in intervals of 5 million, and see which model fits the data best.", "Here’s the type of output I got using non-linear programming, with 65 million as the market size.", "(Black line is model; blue line is real life Netflix data.)", "You can likely see the same problem I do. Basically, the lines at the very end now trending in different directions.", "As I looked at the error rates, the problem is that early errors are weighted the same as later errors, even though the magnitude in actual numbers are much smaller earlier on.", "So I tossed the “percentage” and just optimized for the “Mean Absolute Error” in real terms. Here’s what that looks like for 70 million subscribers:", "Wow, that looks pretty nice! The MAE is about 600K subscriber misses. As I ran these scenarios, with the MAE, 70 million subscribers ended up the best fitting model.", "On to streaming subscribers. (Not streaming “only” but subscribers who used streaming and/or DVDs.) I made some assumptions about early streaming adoption, then put those same numbers into the Solver model.", "And now the table of results for Mean Absolute Error. I tried MAPE, but ran into the same issue where the early errors pulled the table down too much.", "I highlighted 72 million because I drilled into that specific range and that’s the model that gets the absolute best fit.", "This means that ultimately I see Netflix total market for streamers at about 72 million in the United States for streaming subscribers.", "Listen, I really like the above fit, but no model is perfect. Here are the critiques I would level at myself:", "– First, the sample size is pretty small. We only used annual data points which means we have sample sizes of 21 and 13 respectively.", "– Second, this model has a “margin of error”, but using this method I couldn’t really tell you what it is in a rigorous fashion.", "Netflix won’t end up with precisely 72 million subscribers, so the eventual numbers will be off in some fashion.", "– Third, I had to make assumptions about the streaming adoption in the early time period and DVD-only customers in the later period.", "Assumptions are always a source of risk/error. I’d add that in the streaming only model, my initial assumptions seem a bit low and likely Netflix had some more early adoption than I assume.", "(They had a large installed base of customers to quickly adopt is my explanation.)", "– Fourth, this year really is critical. And hence will impact the model. If the content works and Netflix adds 8% subscribers from last year’s end, 75 million looks more likely.", "– Fifth, and most importantly, using “current subscribers” versus “total subscribers” really is a problem here.", "It’s huge. Frankly, Netflix used to report gross versus net subscribers, and when you see those numbers (you will), you forget how many people churned in and out of Netflix every year.", "In short, there’s a chance Netflix has actually had a much higher total streamer adoption than these numbers, they just haven’t shared that.", "– I’d add, this is one of those times I wish I had peer review. So I welcome feedback. One of the joys of writing is that the inter webs have way more eyes than I do, so I get tons of great recommendations/feedback.", "Implications – Why This Matters & How You Can Use This", "Despite those caveats—and honestly, how few prediction brokers are willing to tell you why their model may be wrong?—I think we can learn a few crucial insights from this data.", "In particular, the idea that Netflix will grow until it sucks up all the oxygen in the media universe doesn’t hold up to this scrutiny.", "If there are 120 million households in the US, well, Netflix is going to miss about 48 million of them unless it changes its business model.", "Specifically too, Netflix won’t hit the high end of Reed Hasting’s forecast unless growth rapidly reaccelerates.", "Netflix has previously forecast 60-90 million total US subscribers. But that’s the thing with innovative product diffusion: growth hardly ever just “pick ups” to mid-to-high double digit growth after it slows.", "Especially as a stream of streaming competitors enters the market. And as cash flow pressures force price increases.", "(Which is another caveat I’d love to know: how did artificially low prices impact growth rates? There’s a Bass Model for that, but I’m not skilled enough to deploy it.)", "Other streamers can learn something too. If you built your model for 120 million US customers, I’d seriously reconsider that.", "For a low end, consider using Netflix as a stand-in for all streamers. That’s probably more accurate, honestly.", "So for Disney+, if it is a “family-focused” brand, and 40% of households are families, well Disney+ nets out to 28 million subscribers in the US.", "That would mean it won’t catch Netflix anytime soon.", "After I finish a model like this, I try to find other estimates. I couldn’t find any Netflix-specific estimates in academic articles but just last week, I found The Hollywood Reporter published an article by Simon Murray that forecasts that Netflix will add 10 million subscribers in the next five years.", "Hey, that matches my estimate too! (I’ve seen other Netflix forecasts predicting similar slow downs too.)", "Then today, I saw an article that is way back at the high end, with THR reporting the investment company is forecasting 90 million subscribers in the next ten years.", "Honestly, I’d take this model built on data over subscriber survey results.", "Three specific projects leap off the page for me. First, if I used the quarterly data in the model developed, we’d essentially quadruple our data set.", "Which would add some noise to the data, but again more data points.", "Second, international, right? Of course, we’re much farther from the inflection point for growth and we have even fewer data points to choose from.", "Plus, you could do both “global” penetration and “international” (everything not US), so I’ll have to play with that model.", "Third, attempt to do all “streamer” adoption versus “Netflix only”. Similarly, I could run the analysis to “cord cutting”, which I’ve been mulling.", "Or to focus on Hulu or another streamer, if we have enough data to do it.

The metrics measured retention, revenue, and cost, but just as important, customer behavior changes.", "We kept a keen eye on the metrics and looked for unexplained changes.", "In the spring of 2005, the metrics showed a sudden increase in monthly cancel rate.

This obscured an annual cancel rate increase due to summer weather.", "2005 was the first year we had not lowered our price as summer approached.", "This exploration of cancel rates helped form a new hypothesis about how to improve retention. While looking at regional data, we noticed a surprisingly fast improvement in cancel rates in Hawaii.", "Below, I loosely recreate the data for Hawaii, San Jose, and Boise:", "The lowest cancel rate (San Jose) made sense as we had launched the service there first. Boise had launched a few years later and its cancel rate was slowly approaching San Jose’s rate.", "The surprise was the rate of improvement in Hawaii. Why had it dropped from 8% to less than 6% in less than two months?", "The answer was simple. When we first offered the service in Hawaii, we shipped disks from our Los Angeles hub, and the DVDs took three days to arrive.", "In August, however, we launched a new DVD-by-mail hub in Honolulu. Disk delivery speed improved from three days to overnight and led to lower cancel rates.", "We formed a new hypothesis: “Increasing the rate of DVD shipment speed will improve retention.” We also added a new metric to the e-staff metrics: “The percentage of DVDs delivered the next day.”", "Over the next few years, our operations team expanded our automated DVD delivery system from twenty hubs to the equivalent of one hundred.", "We also tied our inventory system to the website’s merchandising system and only displayed titles on a member’s site if the DVD was available to ship the next day from that member’s local hub.", "The Hawaii data led us to nation-wide delight through faster DVD delivery.

It’s good to know who your customers are — we were often surprised.", "- Cancel survey. When customers canceled, we asked them why they left. This gave us a trend line — if an issue spiked over time, we would address it quickly.", "- Sample data.

Put another way, customers didn’t value the improvement enough to justify the larger investment in inventory.", "We had a formula that helped define this balancing act. We were willing to spend up to $200 for each “saved customer,” or twice the lifetime value of a customer.", "The 2x “word-of-mouth” factor was our way of encouraging product leaders to double down on delight. The rationale was that not only would an improvement cause one customer to retain, but that customer would rave about the service, bringing another customer to the service for free.", "Many of the A/B test results were non-intuitive. In building the site and TV-based experience, we repeatedly found that simple trumps complete.", "But there was a notable exception: our non-member site. Every six months we A/B tested a simpler non-member experience but the more complicated control kept winning.", "Our theory: strong value messages improve conversion, and one way to communicate value is to put lots of “stuff” on the page.", "Finally, in 2013, the simple non-member page won. By this time, the Netflix brand had grown in meaning and communicated the value of the service on its own.", "Today, you see a substantially simpler non-member site:", "Another recent insight via A/B testing: In the past year, Netflix switched from a five-star rating system to a simpler “thumbs up, thumbs down” rating system.", "While members grumbled about the change, the new system doubled the number of ratings.", "There’s another consumer insight hiding in this result. If you look carefully at the movie display page for a movie, there are no stars, but instead an indication of the likelihood you’ll enjoy a movie — the “percentage match.”", "There’s a lot of consumer insight behind this outcome, which Netflix learned through a combination of existing data, qualitative and A/B testing:", "- The original hypothesis was that the more high-quality movies members watched (as measured by high star average) the better they would retain.", "This notion was consistent with what customers said in qualitative. Unfortunately, the data did not prove this out.", "Over time, higher average ratings for members did not lead to higher retention.", "- In shifting to “percentage match,” Netflix acknowledged that while you may rate a “leave your brains at the door” Adam Sandler comedy only three stars, you enjoy watching it.", "And as much as you feel good about watching “Schindler’s List,” and give it five stars, it doesn’t increase your overall enjoyment.", "Through a combination of analyzing existing data, what customers say in qualitative, and A/B test results, Netflix shifted from stars to thumbs, along with a percentage likelihood you’ll “match” a movie, irrespective of “star quality.”", "This ten year shift, from stars to “percentage match,” illustrates the key to creating a customer-obsessed culture: dedication to the experimental method, using a mix of all four research techniques.", "And, like faster DVD delivery, Netflix’s personalization technology hits the “trifecta.” It delights customers with great movie choices, is very hard-to-copy (Netflix understands the movie tastes of 120M member worldwide), and improves margin (by merchandising movies that cost less).", "Why use all four research techniques? Each tactic has its own blind spots. For instance, existing data describes what’s happening today, but not in the future.", "And customers nicely “lie” in both qualitative and surveys (“I’d never watch Adam Sandler!,” and there are lots of things you can’t A/B test.", "(Think about Netflix’s failed attempt to spin out its DVD business via “Qwikster” — it wasn’t testable.)", "Below, I’ve done my best to outline the strengths and weaknesses of each approach. (Green is good, red is bad):", "As a “consumer scientist,” you have a range of research techniques at your fingertips, and the formation, testing, and analysis of each hypothesis requires a mix of techniques.", "The key to creating a customer-obsessed culture is to embrace consumer science and to engage in high cadence testing to learn quickly through both success and failure.", "- Does your company have a well-developed set of “e-staff metrics” that helps you form hypotheses, but also educates your team about the balance of delight and margin?", "- Do you have surveys, indicating the demographics of your customers, why they leave, as well as a Net Promoter Score?", "Do you have the ability to gather “sample data” from customers to build a trend line and identify mistakes quickly?", "- Do you have ongoing focus groups, one-on-ones and usability sessions with customers? Does your team meet and talk with customers to develop the “voice of the customer” within your organization?", "- Do you have an A/B test capability that allows you to measure the trade-off between delight and margin, and develop your team’s intuition to form stronger hypotheses in the future?", "- Based on consumer insights and learnings, do you have a product strategy that defines your hypotheses about what you hope will fulfill the trifecta of delighting customers in hard-to-copy, margin-enhancing ways?", "There’s one more requirement: Patience.

A contrast to cable television where there is only a 35% chance of a show being renewed after the first season.", "What is the secret to their success? Big data and analytics.", "So, how does Netflix use data analytics? By collecting data from their 151 million subscribers, and implementing data analytics models to discover customer behaviour and buying patterns.", "Then, using that information to recommend movies and TV shows based on their subscribers’ preferences.", "According to Netflix, over 75% of viewer activity is based off personalised recommendations. Netflix collects several data points to create a detailed profile on its subscribers.", "The profile is far more detailed than the personas created through conventional marketing.", "Most significantly, Netflix collects customer interaction and response data to a TV show.

To collect all this data and harness it into meaningful information, Netflix requires data analytics.", "For example, Netflix uses what is known as the recommendation algorithm to suggest TV shows and movies based on user’s preferences.", "Netflix’s ability to collect and use the data is the reason behind their success. According to Netflix, they earn over a billion in customer retention because the recommendation system accounts for over 80% of the content streamed on the platform.", "Netflix also uses its big data and analytics tools to decide if they want to greenlight original content.", "To an outsider, it might look like Netflix is throwing their cash at whatever they can get, but in reality, they greenlight original content based on several touch points derived from their user base.", "For example, Netflix distributed ‘Orange is the New Black’ knowing it would be a big hit on their platform.", "How?

He argued that in times of technological advancement companies that had succeeded at one business often clung too tightly to tradition and to what had made them successful.", "And then they were toast. He didn't want that to happen to Netflix. While few people disagree with that assessment, some within Netflix doubted Hastings' assessment of how quickly Netflix needed to shift to streaming.", "But Hastings pressed ahead. Around March 2011, he took his plan to his executive team and then to the company's vice presidents.", "Some of the execs who heard Hastings talk about spinning off Netflix's DVD operations into a new company, referred to internally as DVD Co. and later Qwikster, left the meeting thinking Hastings was only considering the idea.", "That impression was quickly corrected. Within about 72 hours, some of the group learned that Hastings had already offered the new company's CEO position to Andy Rendich, Netflix's respected chief service and operations officer.", "Netflix rapidly began executing the plan. Some employees were stunned by how quickly and unemotionally DVD operations, the backbone of the business for a decade, was split off from the company.", "DVD Co. was moved out of Netflix's offices to a space a few blocks away.

The company was headed to a streaming-video future, and obtaining Web rights for movies and TV shows is tricky.", "Where once Netflix could obtain discs from a plethora of wholesalers and retailers -- even when Hollywood refused to supply the company with DVDs -- there were few ways around the studios when it came to streaming rights.", "Sarandos had the Hollywood relationships, and his solid gold Rolodex was very valuable to Netflix.", "McCarthy was livid, said the sources, and he went to Hastings to discuss his salary.

The previous September, when Netflix launched operations in Canada, the company was accused of hiring actors to appear at a press conference and dupe reporters into believing they were fans of the service.", "Netflix said the actors were hired for a separate promotion and denied they intended to deceive anyone.", "Ross had little to do with the situation, according to sources. They say the mistake was made by a junior person at an outside PR agency.", "Nonetheless, Hastings blamed Ross, who resigned in February 2011.", "\"The flub in Canada was amateurish but not more than that,\" Ross told CNET. \"It didn't impact what was a resoundingly successful international launch but it did bring things into focus.", "The fact is, after commuting for six years from Los Angeles to Silicon Valley, I'd been contemplating an exit strategy for some time and had been struggling with it.", "It was clear to me in the aftermath of the Canada launch that the next chapter in the Netflix story needed to belong to someone else.\"", "Still, in early 2011 Hastings had little reason to doubt himself. Netflix's share price had surged more than 200 percent during 2010, and that February he enjoyed a unique honor.", "When a dinner was held for President Barack Obama by some of the tech sector's most notable leaders, Hastings was there, alongside Steve Jobs, Larry Ellison, and Mark Zuckerberg.", "As for the company's direction, Hastings was unwavering: Streaming, streaming, streaming. He'd been preaching it for years.", "In May 2008, the CEO predicted that DVD rentals would peak within five years.

Customers complained that Netflix was asking them to pay more for less.", "Behind the scenes, Hollywood film studios, which had never been keen on Netflix, began raising the fees to license movies for Internet streaming, or Netflix was prevented from acquiring certain titles because the Internet rights were already locked up by other outlets.", "Starz is a premium pay TV service that owned the Internet rights for about 2,500 Disney and Sony Pictures movies.", "In 2008, Starz leased the movies to Netflix for three years.

The company's public relations execs said the Starz films represented only 2 percent of viewing time.", "But that's not what the company had said earlier. In January 2010, Netflix leaders called the Starz agreement \"one of our most important deals.\"", "Starz was one of the few places where Netflix could get its hands on relatively recent movies to stream.", "For Starz, the announcement was brilliant timing. Ordinarily, Netflix customers would have slammed Starz for being a money-grubbing old-media company.", "Instead, the announcement came just about the time the Netflix price increase began kicking in for some of the company's subscribers, and Netflix took the heat.", "On Wall Street, the failure to sign Starz sounded warning bells. Some wondered whether Netflix could afford the rising costs of streaming video.", "Netflix shares, which had topped $300 the day before the price increase was announced, were down 25 percent.", "Hastings wasn't around to witness much of the fallout from this latest setback. He and some of his managers embarked on a two-week trip to Latin America to help open more than 40 new markets, including Mexico, Brazil and Chile.", "When the CEO returned in mid-September, his company was in crisis.", "On September 15, Netflix issued a startling announcement. Managers said they expected 1 million fewer U.S. subscribers in the third quarter than previously anticipated, a 4 percent shortfall.", "Wall Street began to panic. At the close of trading that day, Netflix's shares were down nearly $40, or about 19 percent, to close at $169.25.", "Hasting's next move made matters worse.

He wanted it videotaped in the courtyard of the company's Los Gatos headquarters, no rehearsal and very casual.", "Initially, Netflix planned for Hastings to announce Qwikster in a few media outlets with select reporters.", "Friedland killed that idea, telling colleagues that Hastings was too emotional. The news was also starting to leak and reporters were calling about rumors regarding a new spinoff.", "Hastings told his staff that if Netflix didn't hurry and announce, someone else would do it for them.", "The video was posted to YouTube that night. Critics said it was confusing and both Hastings and Rendich looked uncomfortable.", "Unfortunately, the hubbub over the video overshadowed a contrite blog post from Hastings.", "\"I messed up,\" Hastings wrote. \"I owe everyone an explanation. It is clear from the feedback over the past two months that many members felt we lacked respect and humility in the way we announced the separation of DVD and streaming, and the price changes...", "In hindsight, I slid into arrogance based upon past success.

Hastings was messing with his company's promise of simplicity.", "Qwikster lasted all of three weeks before Hastings killed the plan on October 10.

They say that he rarely got the credit from management he deserved and that when Hastings botched the Qwikster launch, Rendich \"got tossed under the bus.\"", "\"Rendich is gone?\" Pachter, the research analyst, asked when informed of the executive's departure. \"What was Netflix before streaming?", "The success was built on customer service and getting those DVDs turned around quickly and that was Andy.", "In January, Netflix said goodbye to Kilgore, the company's chief marketing officer since 2000. A former Amazon executive, Kilgore resigned and took a non-executive position on Netflix's board.", "This was a graceful shift but it was not without some discomfort. The architect for Qwikster had mostly been Hastings, but Kilgore helped.", "Hastings publicly acknowledged that he screwed up, but plenty of people inside Netflix believed that Kilgore shared some of the blame.", "Hastings had considered limiting Kilgore's role at the company long before Qwikster, say insiders. It was Kilgore, the chief marketing executive -- not the chief financial officer -- who oversaw the annual and quarterly subscriber forecasts.", "Kilgore controlled public relations. Kilgore had let it be known that if her duties were ever reduced, she would leave.", "Hastings relented until after Qwikster, when he made it clear he would finally restructure marketing.", "In a little over a year, four of Netflix's top managers -- McCarthy, Kilgore, Rendich and Ross -- were out.", "Some of them were instrumental in helping take the company public in 2002. They helped lay waste to traditional movie renting, and created one of the most recognizable and respected brands on the Internet.", "The turnaround that Hastings appeared to be orchestrating in the fourth quarter of 2011 didn't last long.", "Last April, the company issued a first-quarter earnings report that included a $5 million loss on revenue of $870 million.", "Netflix also predicted light subscriber growth. Hastings asked for calm and said the business was performing well.", "\"I don't think anyone is ready to give Netflix the benefit of the doubt at this point,\" Aaron Kessler, an Internet analyst with Raymond James, told the Associated Press in April.", "Nonetheless, the prospects for today's Netflix are brighter than the tale of last year's disaster might lead one to expect.", "Netflix managers still have their distribution platform, which includes more than 800 devices that are compatible with the company's streaming service.", "They are still aggressively priced at $8 per month for streaming or $16 for DVD and streaming. Nobody, not Apple, Google, HBO or Amazon, comes close to offering access to as much content for the same price.", "The company continues to invest in original and exclusive content, such as the upcoming series \"House of Cards\" and \"Arrested Development.\"", "Last week, Hastings caused a stir by posting to his Facebook page a note that Netflix subscribers set a new benchmark by watching 1 billion hours of television shows and movies via the service in the month of June.", "That pushed Netflix shares up 13 percent to $81.72 on Thursday.", "Netflix, to some observers, is shaking off its self-inflicted wounds.", "\"Competition remains a very significant risk,\" Mark Mahaney, a research analyst for Citigroup, wrote recently.", "\"But Netflix's execution track record -- even with [last year's] pricing and product mistakes -- is relatively strong.", "And the Netflix Streaming story is still early days.\"", "At close of trading on Tuesday, Netflix shares were down 3 percent to $80.23. That's still down 73 percent from the company's high of $304 back on July 11, 2011.", "The challenges, however, are many. There's more competition domestically and abroad. The costs of expanding to new markets looks high, and there are doubts that the company can afford to pay for expansion while it's trying to keep up with the spiking costs of licensing fees.", "Finally, it's still unknown whether the new version of Netflix's management team can execute as effectively as the old one.", "Netflix is in a knife fight again, and now it has to work harder than ever to keep customers on its side.", "\"I think with the original content Netflix acquires, if they hit on a 'Mad Men,' if these shows start driving traffic and Netflix becomes more like HBO, I think they can make the transition,\" said Kaltschnee of the blog Hackingnetflix.com.", "\"But people don't see them like they once did.

Because it’s closest to London, chances are your Netflix device is connected to the Dublin region.", "What happens if the entire Dublin region fails? Does that mean Netflix should stop working for you? Of course not!", "Netflix, after detecting the failure, redirects you to Virginia. Your device would now talk to the Virginia region instead of Dublin.", "How often does an AWS region fail? Once a month. Well, a region doesn’t actually fail every month. Netflix runs monthly tests.", "Every month Netflix causes a region to fail on purpose just to make sure its system can handle region level failures.", "Netflix calls this their global services model. Any customer can be served out of any region. This is amazing.", "And it doesn’t happen automatically. AWS has no magic sauce for handling region failures or serving customers out of multiple regions.", "Netflix has done all this work on its own. Netflix is a pioneer in figuring out how to create reliable systems using multiple regions.", "I’m not aware of any other company that goes to these lengths to make their service so reliable.", "Another advantage of being in these three regions is that it gives Netflix world-wide coverage. Netflix ran some tests and found if you use a Netflix application anywhere in the world, you’ll get fast service from one of these three regions.", "This may surprise a lot of people, but AWS is cheaper for Netflix. The cloud costs per streaming view ended up being a fraction of the cost of its old datacenters.", "Netflix could add servers when it needed them and return them when it didn’t. Rather than have a lot of extra computers hanging around doing nothing just to handle peak load, Netflix only had to pay for what was needed, when it was needed.", "All the stuff we talked about in the What is Cloud Computing? chapter.", "Anything that doesn’t involve serving video is handled in AWS.", "This includes scalable computing, scalable storage, business logic, scalable distributed databases, big data processing and analytics, recommendations, transcoding, and hundreds of other functions.", "Don’t worry, you don’t need to understand what all those things are, but since you may find it interesting, I’ll explain them briefly.", "Scalable computing is EC2 and scalable storage is S3. Nothing new for us here.", "Your Netflix device—iPhone, TV, Xbox, Android phone, tablet, etc.—talks to a Netflix service running in EC2.", "View a list of potential videos to watch? That’s your Netflix device contacting a computer in EC2 to get the list.", "Ask for more details about a video? That’s your Netflix device contacting a computer in EC2 to get the details.", "It’s just like all the other cloud services we’ve talked about in the book.", "Netflix uses both DynamoDB and Cassandra for their distributed databases. Not that these names should mean anything to you, they’re just high-quality database products.", "Database. A database stores data. Your profile information, your billing information, all the movies you’ve ever watched, all that kind of information is stored in a database.", "Distributed. Distributed means the database doesn’t run on one big computer, it runs on many computers.", "Your data is copied to multiple computers so if one or even two computers holding your data fail, your data will be safe.", "In fact, your data is copied to all three regions. That way, if a region fails your data will be there when the new region is ready to start using it.", "Scalable. Scalable means the database can handle as much data as you ever want to put into it. That’s one major advantage of being a distributed database.", "More computers can be added as necessary to handle more data.", "Big data simply means there’s a lot of data. Netflix collects a lot of information. Netflix knows what everyone has watched when they watched it and where they were when they watched.", "Netflix knows which videos members have looked at but decided not to watch. Netflix knows how many times each video has been watched…and a lot more.", "Putting all the data in a standard format is called processing.", "Making sense of all that data is called analytics. Data is analyzed to answer specific questions.", "Here’s a great example of how Netflix entices you to watch more videos using its data analytics capabilities.", "When browsing around looking for something to watch on Netflix, have you noticed there’s always an image displayed for each video?", "The header image is meant to intrigue you, to draw you into selecting a video. The idea is the more compelling the header image, the more likely you are to watch a video.", "And the more videos you watch, the less likely you are to unsubscribe from Netflix.", "Here’s an example of different header images for Stranger Things:", "You might be surprised to learn the image shown for each video is selected specifically for you. Not everyone sees the same image.", "Everyone used to see the same header image. Here’s how it worked. Members were shown at a random one picture from a group of options, like the pictures in the above Stranger Things collage.", "Netflix counted every time the video was watched, recording which picture was displayed when the video was selected.", "For our Stranger Things example, let’s say when the group picture in the center was shown, Stranger Things was watched 1,000 times.", "For all the other pictures, it was watched only once each.", "Since the group picture was the best at getting members to watch, Netflix would make it the header image for Stranger Things forever.", "This is called being data-driven. Netflix is known for being a data-driven company. Data is gathered—in this case, the number of views associated with each picture—and used to make the best decisions possible—in this case, which header image to select.", "Clever, but can you imagine doing better? Yes, by using more data. That’s the theme of the future—solving problems by learning from data.", "You and I are likely very different people. Do you think we are motivated by the same kind of header image?", "Probably not. We have different tastes. We have different preferences.", "Netflix knows this too. That’s why Netflix now personalizes all the images they show you. Netflix tries to select the artwork highlighting the most relevant aspect of a video to you.", "Remember, Netflix records and counts everything you do on their site. They know which kind of movies you like best, which actors you like the most, and so on.", "Let’s say one of your recommendations is the movie Good Will Hunting. Netflix must choose a header image to show you.", "The goal is to show an image that lets you know about a movie you’ll probably be interested in. Which image should Netflix show you?", "If you like comedies, Netflix will show you an image featuring Robin Williams. If you prefer romantic movies, Netflix will show you an image Matt Damon and Minnie Driver poised for a kiss.", "By showing Robin Williams, Netflix is letting you know there’s likely to be humor in the movie and because Netflix knows you like comedies, this video is a good match.", "The Matt Damon and Minnie Driver image conveys a completely different message. If you’re a comedy fan and saw this image, you might skip right on by.", "That’s why selecting the right header image is so important. It sends a strong personalized signal indicating what a movie is about.", "If you’ve watched a lot of movies starring Uma Thurman, then you’re likely to see the header image featuring Uma.", "If you’ve watched a lot of movies starring John Travolta, then you’re likely to see the header image featuring John.", "Can you see how choosing the best possible personalized artwork might make you more likely to watch a particular video?", "Netflix appeals to your interests when selecting artwork, yet Netflix doesn’t want to lie to you either.", "They don’t want to show a clickbait image just to get you to watch a video you may not like. There’s no incentive in that.", "Netflix isn’t paid per video watched. Netflix tries to minimize regret. Netflix wants you to be happy with the videos you watch, so they pick the best header images they can for you.", "This is just one small example of how data analysis is used by Netflix. Netflix uses these kind of strategies everywhere.", "Usually Netflix will show you only 40 to 50 video options, yet they have many thousands of videos available.", "That’s part of the big data processing and analytics we just talked about. Netflix looks at its data and predicts what you’ll like.", "In fact, everything you see see on a Netflix screen was chosen specifically for you using machine learning.", "Here’s where we start transitioning into how video is handled by Netflix.", "Before you can watch a video on your favorite device of choice, Netflix must convert the video into a format that works best for your device.", "Transcoding is the process that converts a video file from one format to another, to make videos viewable across different platforms and devices.", "Netflix encodes all its video in AWS on as many as 300,000 CPUs at one time. That’s larger than most super computers!", "Who sends video to Netflix? Production houses and studios. Netflix calls this video source media. The new video is given to the Content Operations Team for processing.", "The video comes in a high definition format that’s many terabytes in size. A terabyte is big. Imagine 60 stacks of paper as tall as the Eiffel Tower.", "Before you can view a video, Netflix puts it through a rigorous multi-step process.", "The first thing Netflix does is spend a lot of time validating the video. It looks for digital artifacts, color changes, or missing frames that may have been caused by previous transcoding attempts or data transmission problems.", "After the video is validated, it’s fed into what Netflix calls the media pipeline.", "A pipeline is simply a series of steps data is put through to make it ready for use, much like an assembly line in a factory.", "More than 70 different pieces of software have a hand in creating every video.", "It’s not practical to process a single multi-terabyte sized file, so the first step of the pipeline is to break the video into lots of smaller chunks.", "The video chunks are then put through the pipeline so they can be encoded in parallel. In parallel simply means the chunks are processed at the same time.", "Let’s say you have one hundred dirty dogs that need washing. Which would be faster, one person washing the dogs one after another?", "Or would it be faster to hire one hundred dog washers and wash them all the same time?", "Obviously, it’s faster to have one hundred dog washers working at the same time. That’s parallelism. And that’s why Netflix uses so many servers in EC2.", "They need a lot of servers to process these huge video files in parallel. It works too. Netflix says a source media file can be encoded and pushed to their CDN in as little as 30 minutes.", "Once the chunks are encoded, they’re validated to make sure no new problems have been introduced.", "Then the chunks are assembled back into a file and validated once again.", "The encoding process creates a lot of files. Why? The end goal for Netflix is to support every internet-connected device.", "Netflix started streaming video in 2007 on Microsoft Windows. Over time more devices were added—Roku, LG, Samsung Blu-ray, Apple Mac, Xbox 360, LG DTV, Sony PS3, Nintendo Wii, Apple iPad, Apple iPhone, Apple TV, Android, Kindle Fire, and Comcast X1.", "In all, Netflix supports 2200 different devices. Each device has a video format that looks best on that particular device.", "If you’re watching Netflix on an iPhone, you’ll see a video that gives you the best viewing experience on the iPhone.", "Netflix calls all the different formats for a video its encoding profile.", "Netflix also creates files optimized for different network speeds. If you’re watching on a fast network, you’ll see higher quality video than you would if you’re watching over a slow network.", "There are also files for different audio formats. Audio is encoded into different levels of quality and in different languages.", "There are also files included for subtitles. A video may have subtitles in a number of different languages.", "There are a lot of different viewing options for every video. What you see depends on your device, your network quality, your Netflix plan, and your language choice.", "Stranger Things season 2 has even more files. It was shot in 8K and has nine episodes. The source video files were many, many terabytes of data.", "It took 190,000 CPU hours to encode just one season.", "The result? 9,570 different video, audio, and text files!", "Netflix has tried three different video streaming strategies its own small CDN; third-party CDNs; and Open Connect.", "Let’s start by defining CDN. A CDN is a content distribution network.", "Content for Netflix—is of course—the video files we discussed in the previous section.", "Distribution means video files are copied from a central location, over a network and stored on computers located all over the world.", "For Netflix, the central location where videos are stored is S3.", "The idea behind a CDN is simple: put video as close as possible to users by spreading computers throughout the world.", "When a user wants to watch a video, find the nearest computer with the video on it and stream to the device from there.", "The biggest benefits of a CDN are speed and reliability.", "Imagine you’re watching a video in London and the video is being streamed from Portland, Oregon. The video stream must pass through a lot of networks, including an undersea cable, so the connection will be slow and unreliable.", "By moving video content as close as possible to the people watching it, the viewing experience will be as fast and reliable as possible.", "Each location with a computer storing video content is called a PoP or point of presence. Each PoP is a physical location that provides access to the internet.", "It houses servers, routers, and other telecommunications equipment. We’ll talk more about PoPs later.", "In 2007, when Netflix debuted its new streaming service, it had 36 million members in 50 countries, watching more than a billion hours of video each month, streaming multiple terabits of content per second.", "To support the streaming service, Netflix built its own simple CDN in five different locations within the United States.", "The Netflix video catalog was small enough at the time that each location contained all of its content.", "In 2009, Netflix decided to use 3rd-party CDNs. Around this time, the pricing for 3rd-party CDNs was coming down.", "Using 3rd-party CDNs made perfect sense for Netflix. Why spend all the time and effort building a CDN of your own when you can instantly reach the globe using existing CDN services?", "Netflix contracted with companies like Akamai, Limelight, and Level 3 to provide CDN services. There’s nothing wrong with using third-party CDNs.", "In fact, pretty much every company does. For example, the NFL has used Akamai to stream live football games.", "By not building out its own CDN, Netflix had more time to work on other higher priority projects.", "Netflix put a lot of time and effort into developing smarter clients. Netflix created algorithms to adapt to changing networks conditions.", "Even in the face of errors, overloaded networks, and overloaded servers, Netflix wants members always viewing the best picture possible.", "One technique Netflix developed is switching to a different video source—say another CDN, or a different server—to get a better result.", "At the same time, Netflix was also devoting a lot of effort into all the AWS services we talked about earlier.", "Netflix calls the services in AWS its control plane. Control plane is a telecommunications term identifying the part of the system that controls everything else.", "In your body, your brain is the control plane; it controls everything else.", "Then Netflix thought it could do better by developing it’s own CDN.", "In 2011, Netflix realized at its scale it needed a dedicated CDN solution to maximize network efficiency.", "Video distribution is a core competency for Netflix and could be a huge competitive advantage.", "So Netflix started developing Open Connect, its own purpose-built CDN. Open Connect launched in 2012.", "- Less expensive. 3rd-party CDNs are expensive. Doing it themselves would save a lot of money.", "- Better quality. By controlling the entire video path—transcoding, CDN, clients on devices—Netflix reasoned it could deliver a superior video viewing experience.", "- More Scalable. Netflix has the goal of providing service everywhere in the world. Quickly supporting all those people while providing a quality video viewing experience required building its own system.", "The 3rd-party CDNs must support users accessing any kind of content from anywhere in the world. Netflix has a much simpler job.", "Netflix knows exactly who its users are because they must subscribe to Netflix. Netflix knows exactly which videos it needs to serve.", "Just knowing it only has to serve large video streams allows Netflix to make a lot of smart optimization choices other CDNs can’t make.", "Netflix also knows a lot about it members. The company knows which videos they like to watch and when they like to watch them.", "With this kind of knowledge, Netflix built a really high-performing CDN. Let’s go into more details on how Open Connect works.", "Remember how we said a CDN has computers distributed all over the world?", "Netflix developed its own computer system for video storage. Netflix calls them Open Connect Appliances or OCAs.", "Here’s what an early OCA installation in a site looked like:", "There are many OCAs in the above picture. OCAs are grouped into clusters of multiple servers.", "Each OCA is a fast server, highly optimized for delivering large files, with lots and lots of hard disks or flash drives for storing video.", "There are several different kinds of OCAs for different purposes. There are large OCAs that can store Netflix’s entire video catalog.", "There are smaller OCAs that can store only a portion of Netflix’s video catalog. Smaller OCAs are filled with video every day, during off-peak hours, using a process Netflix calls proactive caching.", "We’ll talk more about how proactive caching works later.", "From a hardware perspective, there’s nothing special about OCAs. They’re based on commodity PC components and assembled in custom cases by various suppliers.", "Notice how all Netflix’s computers are red? Netflix had their computers specially made to match their logo color.", "From a software perspective, OCAs use the FreeBSD operating system and NGINX for the web server. Yes, every OCA has a web server.", "Video streams using NGINX. If none of these names make any sense, don’t worry, I’m just including them for completeness.", "The number of OCAs on a site depends on how reliable Netflix wants the site to be, the amount of Netflix traffic (bandwidth) that is delivered from that site, and the percentage of traffic a site allows to be streamed.", "When you press play, you’re watching video streaming from a specific OCA, like the one above, in a location near you.", "For the best possible video viewing experience, what Netflix would really like to do is cache video in your house.", "But that’s not practical yet. The next best thing is to put a mini-Netflix as close to your house as they can.", "Where does Netflix put Open Connect Appliances (OCAs)?", "Netflix delivers huge amounts of video traffic from thousands of servers in more than 1,000 locations around the world.", "Take a look at this map of video serving locations:", "Other video services, like YouTube and Amazon, deliver video on their own backbone network. These companies literally built their own global network for delivering video to users.", "Netflix took a completely different approach to building its CDN.", "Netflix doesn’t operate its own network; it doesn’t operate its own datacenters anymore either. Instead, internet service providers (ISPs) agree to put OCAs in their datacenters.", "OCAs are offered free to ISPs to embed in their networks. Netflix also puts OCAs in or close to internet exchange locations (IXPs).", "Using this strategy Netflix doesn’t need to operate its own datacenters, yet it gets all the benefits of being in a regular datacenter it’s just someone else’s datacenter.", "Those last two paragraphs were pretty dense, so let’s break it down.", "An ISP is your internet provider. It’s who you get your internet service from. It might be Verizon, Comcast, or thousands of other services.", "The main point here is ISPs are located all around the world and they’re close to customers. By placing OCAs in ISP datacenters, Netflix is also all over the world, and close to its customers.", "An internet exchange location is a datacenter where ISPs and CDNs exchange internet traffic between their networks.", "It’s just like going to a party to exchange Christmas presents with your friends. It’s easier to exchange presents if everyone is in one place.", "It’s easier to exchange network traffic if everyone is one place.", "Here’s what the London Internet Exchange looks like:", "Drill down on those yellow fiber optic cables and what you’ll see is something like this from the AMS-IX Internet exchange point, in Amsterdam, Netherlands:", "Each wire in the above picture connects one network to another network. That’s how different networks exchange traffic with each other.", "An IXP is like a highway interchange, only using wires:", "For Netflix, this is another win. IXPs are all over the world. So by putting their OCAs in IXPs, Netflix doesn’t have to run its own datacenters.", "Netflix has all this video sitting in S3. They have all these video serving computers spread throughout the world.", "Netflix uses a process it calls proactive caching to efficiently copy video to OCAs.", "A cache is a hiding place, especially one in the ground, for ammunition, food and treasures.", "Each location they bury nuts is a cache. During the winter, any squirrel can find a nut cache and chow down.", "Arctic explorers sent small teams ahead to cache food, fuel and other supplies along the route they were taking.", "The larger team following behind would stop at every cache location and resupply.", "Both the squirrels and Arctic explorers were being proactive; they were doing something ahead of time to prepare for later.", "Each OCA is a video cache of what you’ll most likely want to watch.", "Netflix caches video by predicting what you’ll want to watch.", "Everywhere in the world, Netflix, knows to a high degree of accuracy what its members like to watch and when they like to watch it.", "Remember how we said Netflix was a data-driven company?", "Netflix uses its popularity data to predict which videos members probably will want to watch tomorrow in each location.", "Here, location means a cluster of OCAs housed within an ISP or IXP.", "Netflix copies the predicted videos to one or more OCAs at each location. This is called prepositioning.", "This gives great service to members. The video they want to watch is already close to them, ready and available for streaming.", "Netflix operates what is called a tiered caching system.", "The smaller OCAs we talked about earlier are placed in ISPs and IXPs. These are too small to contain the entire Netflix catalog of videos.", "Other locations have OCAs containing most of Netflix’s video catalog. Still, other locations have big OCAs containing the entire Netflix catalog.", "Every night, each OCA wakes up and asks a service in AWS which videos it should have. The service in AWS sends the OCA a list of videos it’s supposed to have based on the predictions we talked about earlier.", "Each OCA is in charge of making sure it has all the videos on its list. If an OCA in the same location has one of the videos it’s supposed to have, then it will copy the video from the local OCA.", "Otherwise, a nearby OCA with the video will be found and copied.", "Since Netflix forecasts what will be popular tomorrow, there’s always a one day lead time before a video is required to be on an OCA.", "This means videos can be copied during quiet, off-peak hours, substantially reducing bandwidth usage for ISPs.", "There’s never a cache miss in Open Connect. A cache miss would be asking for a specific video from an OCA and the OCA saying it doesn’t have it.", "Cache misses happen all the time on other CDNs because you can’t afford to copy content everywhere. Since Netflix knows all the videos it must cache, it knows exactly where each video is at all times.", "If a smaller OCA doesn’t have a video, then one of the larger OCAs is always guaranteed to have it.", "Why doesn’t Netflix just copy all their video to every OCA in the world? Its video catalog is way too large to store everything at all locations.", "In 2013, the video catalog for Netflix was over 3 petabytes; I have no idea how large it is today, but I can only assume it’s significantly larger.", "That’s why Netflix developed the method of choosing which videos to store on each OCA using data to predict what their members will want to watch.", "Let’s take an example. House of Cards is a very popular show. Which OCAs should it be copied to? Probably every location because members worldwide will want to watch House of Cards.", "What if a video isn’t as popular as House of Cards? Netflix decides which locations it should be copied to in order to best serve nearby member requests.", "Within a location, a popular video like House of Cards is copied to many different OCAs. The more popular a video, the more servers it will be copied to.", "Why? If there was only one copy of a very popular video, streaming the video to members would overwhelm the server.", "A video isn’t considered live when it’s copied to just one OCA. Netflix wants to be able to play the same content at the same time everywhere in the world.", "Only when there are a sufficient number of OCAs with enough copies of the video to serve it appropriately, will the video be considered live and ready for members to watch.", "Daredevil Season 2 in 2016, for example, was the first time Netflix released all episodes of a show, on all devices, in all countries, at the same time.", "Why would an ISP agree to put an OCA cluster inside their network? At first blush, it seems too generous, but you’ll be happy to know it’s rooted firmly in self-interest.", "To understand why, we’ll need to talk about how networks work. I know throughout this book we’ve said cloud services are accessed over the internet.", "That’s not the case for Netflix, at least when watching a video. When using a Netflix app, it talks to AWS over the internet.", "The internet is an interconnect of networks. You have an ISP that provides internet service. I get my internet service from Comcast.", "What that means is my house connects to Comcast’s network using a fiber optic cable. Comcast’s network is their network; it’s not the internet, the internet is something else.", "Let’s say I want to do a Google search, and I type a query into my browser and hit enter.", "My request to Google first flows over Comcast’s network. Google isn’t on Comcast’s network. At some point, my request has to go to Google’s network.", "The internet connects Comcast’s network to Google’s network. There are these things called routing protocols that act like a traffic cop, directing where network traffic goes.", "When my Google query is routed onto the internet it’s not on Comcast’s network anymore, and it’s not on Google’s network.", "The internet is woven together from many privately owned networks that choose to interoperate with each other.", "The IXPs we looked at earlier are one way networks connect with each other.", "In the United States, here’s a map of the long haul fiber network:", "InterTubes: A Study of the US Long-haul Fiber-optic Infrastructure", "What Netflix has done with Open Connect is placed its OCA clusters inside the ISPs network. That means if I watch a Netflix video I’ll be talking to an OCA in Comcast’s network.", "All my video traffic is on Comcast’s network; it never hits the internet.", "The key to scaling video delivery is to be as close to users as possible. When you’re doing that you’re not using the internet backbone.", "Requests are being satisfied on a local part of the network.", "Why is this a good thing? Recall that we said Netflix already consumes more than 37% of the internet traffic in the United States.", "If ISPs didn’t cooperate, Netflix would use even more of the internet. The internet couldn’t handle all the video traffic.", "ISPs would have to add a lot more network capacity, and that’s expensive to build.", "Right now, up to 100% of Netflix content is being served from within ISP networks.

And network performance improves for everyone.", "Earlier we discussed how Netflix increased the reliability of its system by running out of three different AWS regions.", "The architecture of Open Connect accomplished the same goal.", "What may not be immediately obvious is that the OCAs are independent of each other. OCAs act as self-sufficient video-serving archipelagos.", "Members streaming from one OCA are not affected when other OCAs fail.", "What happens when an OCA fails? The Netflix client you’re using immediately switches to another OCA and resumes streaming.", "What happens if too many people in one location use an OCA?

The same sort of thing.", "The Netflix client will find another OCA on a better performing network.", "Open Connect is a very reliable and resilient system.", "Netflix handles failures gracefully because it controls the client on every device running Netflix.", "Netflix develops its Android and iOS apps themselves, so you might expect them to control those. But even on platforms like Smart TVs, where Netflix doesn’t build the client, Netflix still has control because it controls the software development kit (SDK).", "A SDK is a set of software development tools that allows the creation of applications.

We’ve learned a lot. Here’s what we’ve learned so far:", "- Netflix can be divided into three parts: the backend, the client, and the CDN.", "- All requests from Netflix clients are handled in AWS.", "- All video is streamed from a nearby Open Connect Appliance (OCA) in the Open Connect CDN.", "- Netflix operates out of three AWS regions and can usually handle a failure in any region without members even noticing.", "- New video content is transformed by Netflix into many different formats so the best format can be selected for viewing based on the device type, network quality, geographic location, and the member’s subscription plan.", "- Every day, over Open Connect, Netflix distributes video throughout the world, based on what they predict members in each location will want to watch.", "Here’s a picture of how Netflix describes the play process:", "- You select a video to watch using a client running on some device. The client sends a play request, indicating which video you want to play, to Netflix’s Playback Apps service running in AWS.", "- We’ve not talked about this before, but a big part of what happens after you hit play has to do with licensing.", "Not every location in the world has a license to view every video. Netflix must determine if you have a valid license to view a particular video.", "We won’t talk about how that works—it’s really boring—but keep in mind it’s always happening. One reason Netflix started developing its own content is to avoid licensing issues.", "Netflix wants to release a show to everyone in the world all at the same time. Creating its own content is the easiest way for Netflix to avoid worrying about licensing problems.", "- Taking into account all the relevant information, the Playback Apps service returns URLs for up to ten different OCA servers.", "These are the same sort of URLs you use all the time in your web browser. Netflix uses your IP address and information from ISPs to identify which OCA clusters are best for you to use.", "- The client intelligently selects which OCA to use. It does this by testing the quality of the network connection to each OCA.", "It will connect to the fastest, most reliable OCA first. The client keeps running these tests throughout the video streaming process.", "- The client probes to figure out the best way to receive content from the OCA.", "- The client connects to the OCA and starts streaming video to your device.", "- Have you noticed when watching a video the picture quality varies? Sometimes it will look pixelated, and after awhile the picture snaps back to HD quality?", "That’s because the client is adapting to the quality of the network. If the network quality declines, the client lowers video quality to match.", "The client will switch to another OCA when the quality declines too much.", "That’s what happens when you press play on Netflix.

Subscriber growth was not hurt by the pricing increase whatsoever.", "In fact, Netflix added 2 million new streaming subscribers in the US and 6.4 million overseas, 33% more than what Wall Street analysts had forecast.", "Both new and existing customers happily swallowed the price increase, which lifted Netflix’s revenue by 35% (faster than their 25% growth in average paid streaming memberships).", "When asked about the impact of the price increase, CEO Reed Hastings told analysts, “We saw very little effect on sign ups and growth", "[from the price increase] and thus, the really strong results.” #Humblebrag.", "With more subscribers, and with all subscribers now paying 10% more on average, Netflix saw a massive increase in profits.", "Operating income jumped to $245M, up from $154M the previous year.

Let’s do some quick math. If we assume the company has 60 million US subscribers who will now pay $1 more per month and that pricing hasn’t impacted churn or subscriber growth, that means a jaw-dropping $720 million increase in annual revenue.", "All of that extra revenue is pure profit – it doesn’t require new investments in content or hosting or marketing or sales.", "Given that the company made $1.2 billion in net income in 2018, this 13% increase in revenue per customer actually means a 60% increase in profitability.", "Not too bad for a dollar meal sized price increase.", "What you can learn from Netflix’s pricing strategy", "There are a number of lessons SaaS companies should take away from Netflix’s successful 2017 and 2019 pricing changes, as well as from their epic 2011 fail.", "How many business decisions can send your stock price spiraling down by 80% one year and then rocketing up another?", "The Netflix case proves that pricing changes can make or break a business, and therefore it’s important to invest in making the right pricing decisions.", "It also reinforces that even small changes in pricing can add up to major improvements in a company’s profitability.", "2. Don’t let one mistake stop you from touching pricing again", "After the Qwikster disaster of 2011, Netflix could have decided that they were never going to touch pricing again.", "They did, in fact, leave pricing alone until 2014. But over time, Netflix collected evidence that they had an opportunity to revisit pricing in a more thoughtful way.", "When they were ready to do so in 2014, Netflix took a conservative approach to mitigate the risk of another backlash.", "The success of their 2014 pricing change gave Netflix the confidence to take a more aggressive approach the next time around and then an even more aggressive approach in 2019.", "3. Pricing power comes down to value and customer satisfaction", "In their Q4 2017 earnings call, Netflix’s CEO Reed Hastings was asked if he had plans for future price increases.", "His response perfectly summed up a value-based pricing philosophy. With a value-based approach, pricing power is an output that you can measure based on how much value you deliver to customers relative to alternatives on the market.", "It’s not a best guess, a snap decision, or an input based on a company’s cost structure.", "“I think it’s a tricky thing because it really has to be a reflection of the underlying quality of the experience on a relative basis.", "So, as long as we’re able to continue to improve our content and our whole experience at a remarkable rate…then asking our customers to help us fund that at higher levels is reasonable.", "But if we weren’t gaining relative value for the customers, then we wouldn’t be changing prices.”", "One reason why Netflix’s pricing change went over so smoothly was the timing. The 2017 price increase coincided with the launch of amazing new original content, including new seasons of popular series like Stranger Things and The Crown (which I both highly recommend) and the debut of a big budget action film starring Will Smith (Bright).", "Other companies should similarly launch pricing increases when they can tie those increases back to improvements in customer value, for instance through new product launches, increases in NPS, new partnerships, or better analytics.", "Finally, customers respond better to pricing increases when they have options. And that’s true even if the options aren’t all that great.", "In Netflix’s case, while they increased the price of their Standard plan, they kept their entry-level Basic plan at $7.99 per month.", "A budget-conscious customer could by all means downgrade if they could not afford Netflix’s price increase.", "Doing so would mean giving up a lot – no more HD streaming and only 1 concurrent device. Still, having a choice makes the customer feel in control, and makes it easier for them to swallow a price increase.", "What have you learned from Netflix’s pricing strategy?

I thought it was particularly interesting how Netflix used the data in its production of TV shows.", "I wonder how other TV and movie producers use data in their productions. I’d imagine it’s a very controversial topic in the industry, with many people unhappy that the artistic nature of their work is being dampened by the numbers.", "They also have to think about varying goals: box office sales, award shows, ability to sell in international markets, and ability to produce sequels.", "Great post, Sean, thanks! I agree with all of your thoughts and comments about Netflix and how they have been utilising data to improve the offerings it gives to its customers, but I wonder then how they decide to stop hosting shows or films that are very popular.", "Do you think that it is to make people feel excitement when they return? Or perhaps due to licensing deals?", "I switched to Amazon Prime precisely because Netflix stopped offering the show that I wanted to watch and Amazon had it for free.", "It is interesting to me that Netflix did not pick this up in its data and try to mitigate this as it has happened several times since then.", "Thank you for your post Sean. It was very interesting to know more about how data is used in the creative process of Netflix new shows!", "Reading your post, similarly to Zach, I got worried about the creative process of new shows and how data might affect it.", "In my opinion, it would be detrimental to users if this approach ultimately led to a convergence of “blockbuster” themes that appeal to large audiences and are likely to be successful, as opposed to new, more creative ideas.", "At the same time, I wonder if the fact that Netflix knows which subscribers are likely to be interested in a particular show, thus reducing the risk, as you mentioned, could be used as an advantage.", "As micro-classifications and likely audiences are identified, could people be incentivized to produce targeted content by investing small amounts that make economic sense, hence increasing the amount of new and differentiated content?", "I think a lot of what is in this post is what Netflix really wants consumers to think. I would, however, point out a few things that show that even Netflix does not use a pure data driven approach.", "First, when it comes to its recommendation engine, it is clear that Netflix manipulates this beyond pure data analytics.", "The company will often promote its own shows and downplay shows or movies it has less confidence in (or similar offerings of licensed content) to the detriment of consumers.", "It’s not purely data based. Second, when it comes to making content, I would argue that Netflix is indeed trying to be everything for everyone.", "The sheer volume of spend and content indicates that is trying to appeal to everyone, not specific audiences.", "I liken its content strategy to that of dredging the ocean floor and seeing what pops up and works. For every House of Cards, there are a ton of other shows that we don’t know about because they simply did not work – like all other creative endeavors.", "Indeed, Netflix is now much quicker to cancel shows, understanding that data-driven creativity does not always work.", "Despite my pessimism, it is true that in the world of entertainment, Netflix is certainly leading the way in how it uses data.", "Thanks Sean, great post. I do agree that Netflix is definitely the industry leader when it comes to data usage.", "Having said that, from a user standpoint, I still think they have a long way to go.

I agree with you that Netflix is pioneering in using art/science approach in content creation.", "Amazon tried to produce a similar themed show to House of Card, Alpha House, but only saw it achieve 7.1 ratings (vs 9.1 rating of House of Card).", "Some analyzed it’s because Amazon tried to use data all the way from sourcing ideas and creating plot, while Netflix approach is data-driven on initial idea-sourcing but more art/brain-driven in concept and plot creation phase.", "In general, the ability to create successful original content is vital especially when Netflix and Amazon video tries to expand internationally, because international content rights are hideously complex and having your own exclusive IP saves the headache.", "Thanks for posting Sean! I have to say I am a little skeptical about the use of data for what I see as a very creative product.", "I know that data informed decisions can do things like greenlight Orange is the New Black, but I fear that if you use data to create a formulaic production, it won’t have the same heart.", "And I also wonder if using data to see what’s gaining traction is really a new concept.

I completely agree that the smart application of big data has been Netflix’s winning strategy.", "However, as more players are aware of and equipped with data analytics capabilities, I think the accuracy of the data insights would become the differentiating factor.", "I would be curious to see how Netflix is going to sustain its advantage over time.", "I really enjoyed this article.

More data provides the company with more opportunity, but as it grows perhaps Netflix should consider separating its production units.", "I also believe there is a myriad of different factors that contribute to the success of a movie, so I wonder how useful the data is with time as the creative/human aspect of production decreases and ideas narrow in to similar categories.", "Thanks for your thoughtful and valuable contribution, Sean! Your description of Netflix’s recommendation engine reminds me of the perennial dilemma on the “echo chamber” effect of information retrieval and aggregation systems.", "Recommending similar digital contents may indeed drive engagement metrics in the short run, but may also shield the users from discovering thrilling new content like they’ve never seen before.", "Going forward, how can Netflix leverage its data analytics capability to strike the fine balance between content relevance vs. content discovery?", "Great post Sean! I think your point that “analytics does not solely drive creative decisions; Netflix still involves production studios and creative staff to make shows a reality” is particularly interesting and a concern for me as I think about the company’s future.", "Do you think there will ever be a point where Netflix becomes more like a movie studio with a core competency in data-driven decision making as opposed to a personalized streaming platform that also produces shows?", "I’m not sure if the company is already doing this now, but I foresee Netflix striking exclusive development deals with smaller studios (maybe the likes of A24 or Annapurna Pictures), or even outright acquisition of a studio."]}

You’re much stronger building a distributed set of great thinkers,” he says.", "“People tend to think that they need a process for everything, and once in a while you hear ‘We’re going to dummy-proof it.’", "But if you dummy-proof the process, you only get dummies to work there,’’ Hastings says. “That’s why we’re so opposed to that and focused on giving people great freedom.", "They’ll make mistakes, of course, but you’ll get a lot of great ideas.”", "Being aggressive is good, but it can lead to mistakes.", "Netflix made a radical change in its business model in 2009, separating the mail-order business from the streaming business and charging separately, in what amounted to a rate increase of about 60%.", "Consumers hated it, the stock market hated it, and the company quickly backed off. Asked to explain his thinking, Hastings says: “We were so obsessed with not being the next Kodak, the next AOL, about not being the company that clung to its roots and missed the big thing.", "We said if there’s a bias, we should be more aggressive; we have to be so aggressive it makes our skin crawl.”", "In retrospect, Hastings says he realized that his timing was terrible, though he thinks the plan might have worked if existing customers were grandfathered in to avoid a price hike."]}

We get deep into the ideas that she layed out in the culture deck later in the episode.", "But we started at the beginning. Before the culture deck, before Patty was an HR maverick.

Then, you know, get an appointment. Talk to you later.\" And when I had my interview with Reed, he asked me about what my H.R. philosophy was.", "And remember at the time, I spoke fluent H.R.

I'm going to call your question stupid.", "PATTY MCCORD: I was like, you know, \"Ask me a better question then, if you want a better answer.\" And so I came home and my husband said, \"How did it go?\"", "And I said, \"Well you know, I kind of got in a fight with the CEO.\"", "Turns out, didn’t matter. Reed Hastings was impressed with Patty even though she fought with him in the interview… or maybe because she fought with him…", "Now the company that Reed Hastings was starting back then was NOT Netflix.

It can mean success, money, but also, it can be bittersweet.", "The thing we built, our baby, it has a new owner. What are saying goodbye. It can feel like a loss. But what Patty noticed, she and Reed, they had almost none of that second feeling.", "They weren’t really sad. In fact, Patty wondered at the time, why are we not sadder about this?

It just -- it was just so implausible.", "ALEX BLUMBERG: If everybody else saw it, it would have happened already.", "PATTY MCCORD: Right, if it was obvious, somebody would be doing it.", "Now this, remember, was pre-high-speed internet. And back then, the way you rented movies was by going to Blockbuster.", "Remember Blockbuster… it was an actual store. You’d walk into it. They’d rent you videos that you’d play on a thing called a DVD player.", "Reed told Patty he was building a competitor to that. A movie rental company that would send you DVDs through the mail.", "He was calling it Netflix. And a short while after running into Patty in the parking lot, Reed called her and asked her to come help him build it.", "PATTY: When he called me and asked me to come to Netflix I said, \"No, it's a really dumb idea, and secondly I'm consulting now.", "I make a bunch of money. I'm home a lot. My kids know my name. I mean, why would I do this?\" And he said \"Let's create the kind of company that if it was successful we'd still want to work there.\"", "And I'm like, \"Wow! That's -- that's compelling.\" And I said, \"If we did that how would you know?\" Right?", "How would you describe it, Reed?\" And he said, \"I'd want to come in the door every day and solve these problems with these people.\"", "ALEX BLUMBERG: Oh, he would -- it would be like, I would want to come into work every day excited to solve the problems before us with the people around the table, in other words.", "PATTY MCCORD: Good. Perfect. Yes, exactly that. And so he asked me what would my, you know, my nirvana play be", "and I said, \"Wouldn't it be cool if we were a great company to be from?\" You know like, we were like an Apple or a Microsoft or, you know, whoever.", "Where you saw the name on your resume and you thought, \"Oh, that's cool. You were there.\"", "For an HR maverick in the making, it was an enticing vision. So Patty joined Reed at Netflix… And for the first couple of years, it was a scrappy little company taking scrappy measures.", "PATTY MCCORD: We literally took everybody in the company out in the parking lot every Friday, and we went through basically what was the executive dashboard, right?", "We would walk them through the P&L. We would talk about how many subscribers we had, how it was growing, how many we were acquiring, what it cost to acquire them.", "I mean, walking everybody through the metrics of the business, so...", "ALEX BLUMBERG: And you're doing this in the parking lot?", "PATTY MCCORD: Because we didn't have a room big enough for everybody to be in.", "ALEX BLUMBERG: So every Friday or whatever, you would take the whole - the whole company, which is like, what, 100 people?", "ALEX BLUMBERG: I'm just imagining you all out in the parking lot, like ...", "PATTY MCCORD: We learned later -- we learned later that, at one point Blockbuster sent spies to the -- to the other parking lot that was adjacent to listen in.", "ALEX BLUMBERG: You're like, \"Who are those people in the -- in the blue golf shirts over there?\"", "For Patty, all of it was exciting. It was a fast-growing startup… they were trying to something new. And it’s around here, in the early 2000s, that we get to the point in the story where the official seeds of what would become her masterpiece, the culture deck, get planted.", "So what happened was Netflix was growing fast… but there was a lot of bad stuff happening too.", "PATTY: The growth for, particularly in the DVD-by-mail business, the growth was killing us. It was a terrible dilemma, right?", "Where every time we acquired a new customer, we had to buy three DVDs and stamps and envelopes and pay the labor to send it to them.", "ALEX BLUMBERG: So the more customers you got, the more -- the less money you had. Like, each new customer wasn't adding to your bottom line, it was taking away from your bottom line.", "PATTY MCCORD: Yes, they did -- because it was subscription, they would add to the bottom line over time.", "PATTY MCCORD: But we had -- but because, you know, if the economics of the subscription model means that, once your base is deep enough and wide enough to sustain your growth, then it just keeps feeding the machine.", "PATTY MCCORD: But -- but we hadn't gotten to that baseline economics yet.", "PATTY MCCORD: Right? And we weren't really sure whether or not it would work. And we had a very small window to do it before we ran out of money and/or went public, whichever came first.", "ALEX BLUMBERG: Right. And so you were doing this, and your plan was to go public, and you had been building toward that, but then ...", "PATTY MCCORD: We'd been building towards that. We had been, you know, on the sidelines waiting for our IPO, and then the 2000 and, you know, September 11th happened, the economy went to hell happened, the Bay Area dotcom bubble burst.", "ALEX BLUMBERG: And so you guys were just like, \"Oh, no!\"", "PATTY MCCORD: Oh, no! Oh, no! All our plans may be up in smoke, right?", "It was time for drastic action, which meant layoffs. And as head of HR, that was Patty’s department. She started looking at the staff and figuring out who it was essential to keep, and who they could let go.", "And they had to let go of a lot of people. People who’d been there from the beginning, who’d worked hard, poured their hearts and souls into building the company.", "By the end, she’d cut a third of Netflix’s workforce. It was agonizing and painful.", "But after it was all done, Patty said she and Reed noticed something. They were getting twice as much done, with a third fewer people.", "PATTY MCCORD: Reed and I sat down together and went, \"I'm totally excited about coming to work. How about you?\"", "He's like, \"It's the most fun I've ever had. What is it?\" You know, \"What is it? What -- what -- can we -- can we write down this, what's happening here and see if we can codify this into the way we operate?\"", "ALEX BLUMBERG: So you're -- you're saying that you were -- you -- you had laid off all these employees, and then you and Reed come in and you're realizing, \"Wait.", "I like working here way better, because we're accomplishing more with fewer people.\"", "ALEX BLUMBERG: At that point, when did you start to notice at that point that the company was turning around?", "PATTY MCCORD: Oh, we could see it in the subscriber base.", "ALEX BLUMBERG: So the subscriber base, was just growing.", "PATTY MCCORD: Yeah. The subscriber base was just growing organically and exponentially. And we were making so many improvements in the service very, very rapidly.", "And we had assembled a really incredible team on both ends of the DVD-by-mail business: on the -- the web side and the people working on the personalization algorithms, and that whole software side.", "PATTY MCCORD: And we had a really brilliant team of people sort of reinventing the back-end logistics software to move DVDs through the U.S. Postal Service as efficiently as anybody on the planet.", "So things were really clicking along. And you know we used to listen to the Blockbuster earnings call on a polycom in the conference room, right?", "ALEX BLUMBERG: To listen to the Blockbuster earnings call. Your biggest -- your biggest competitor.", "PATTY MCCORD: Our biggest competitor. Who were 100 times bigger than we were at the very least, right?", "PATTY MCCORD: And some -- one analyst asked John Antioco, who's the CEO of Blockbuster, what do you think of this company Netflix?", "And he says -- he gets mad. And he goes, \"They are nothing. They are a gnat. They are nobody. People go to video stores.", "They'll never ever use this service.\" And I remember we were sitting around a table in a conference room.", "Behind this row of people is a whiteboard that shows our customer growth. And it's -- that line is just up and to the right.", "It's practically straight up. And we looked to each other realized, he doesn't know.", "PATTY MCCORD: And then -- and then, you know, internally that was a very, very difficult time because the employees were like, \"Kill them!", "Deal the death blow!\" And we were like, \"No, we gotta wait them out.\"", "PATTY MCCORD: You know, lay low, make it great, wait 'em out, you know? And that was our company mantra for a number of years.", "And that was a -- that was one of the hardest things there was to do.", "ALEX BLUMBERG: Because killing them would have been like, raise a ton of money and just, like, destroy them.", "PATTY MCCORD: Super Bowl ad. Yeah! Right? Gloat at how good we are and how bad they are. And they would have squashed us like a bug.", "Netflix of course did not get squashed like a bug. Instead, in 2002, it finally went public.", "Which put it back into the category of company that Patty had worked at earlier in her career. A big public company.", "With boards, and auditors, and of course, HR manuals, filled with HR policies.", "PATTY: Now, um, the auditors are showing up and the Sarbanes-Oxley people are showing up, and our -- the board, and everybody's saying, you know, you're going to be grown-ups now, it's time to be grown-ups.", "It's time to have policies just like grown-up companies have. Because at that point, we had sort of gotten rid of everything.", "PATTY MCCORD: And it was when, as our executive team, we started saying, \"Really? Do we really have to tell these adult, brilliant, hard-working people to ask permission to spend money?\"", "PATTY MCCORD: Do we really have to have them clock in and out, when half the time, you know, they work from home or work at night.", "PATTY MCCORD: So back up. Why are these policies in place in the first place? Because employees will screw you if you don't watch out.", "And I said, \"Well, what if I took a different tack that says they won't?\"", "PATTY MCCORD: Right? Most people don't come to work and go, \"Gonna screw my company today. How about you?\"", "PATTY MCCORD: Right? Most people come to work and go, \"I want to accomplish something I'm proud of by the end of the day.\"", "PATTY MCCORD: So if you do that, and then you follow the metrics and follow the money, then you'll find out if somebody misused the company's money or made a bad judgment call.", "PATTY MCCORD: And so rather than following the rules, you now rely on people to have maturity and good judgment.", "It’s a big ask but one that seemed worth making. And Patty and Reed started expanding on this thinking.", "Started asking this question: is it inevitable that now that Netflix is a certain size, we have to adopt the HR practices that we’re sick of?", "And so they started asking hard, foundational questions about what is in fact the role of HR, and whether there’s a different, better way to do it.", "And the asking and answering of those foundational questions, over the next 10 years, grew into the Netflix Culture Deck.", "They started reimagining all sorts of things. Vacation policy, for example. Patty and her team realized, “You know what, we don’t need to babysit employee vacation requests.", "Here’s our policy: we have unlimited vacation. You just have to use it responsibly.", "Same deal with expenses. They would no longer track expenses, and require employees to submit 8.5 x 11 sheets of paper with receipts taped on them in order to get paid back for some company expense.", "Their policy became. Use the company’s money wisely. We trust you.", "Patty and Reed continued down this path. Continued trying to build the HR practice for the company they wanted to work at.", "A company that did more and better work with fewer people. A company that had nimble teams with clear goals in front of them.", "And they soon realized that building that company meant reimagining one more thing. Something they’d come to believe standard HR did very poorly.", "Welcome back to Without Fail and my conversation with Patty McCord, the former chief talent officer at Netflix.", "The Netflix Culture Deck, the thing that Patty was putting together little by little as the company grew, it became famous when Netflix CEO Reed Hastings decided to post it online.", "He didn’t even consult Patty first. He just uploaded it, typos and all, and it became wildly popular.", "Sheryl Sandberg said it “may well be the most important document ever to come out of the Valley.”", "And there’s one section in particular that spoke to me when I read it. It starts on page 45, and it points out a dynamic that felt very familiar: as companies grow, so does their complexity, and as complexity increases, things start to feel chaotic.", "And that creates pressure to start implementing rules and procedures. So... if you’re a company that wants to grow AND wants to avoid chaos… a certain amount of corporate bureaucracy starts to feel inevitable.", "But according to Patty’s culture deck, it’s not. Companies can grow while avoiding both chaos and bureaucracy.", "They can have it all. And they can do it by hiring high-performance people. High performance people, the deck says, can operate without as many rules.", "And having a high-performing company that runs informally… that helps you attract more high-performance people, because that’s the kind of culture they like.", "And you know, that sounds great, right? But there is this one other part of it. Occasionally, as you grow, someone who started out being excellent stops being excellent.", "The person who built the brilliant prototype maybe isn’t the best at running the entire division the prototype grew into.", "And so, you have to be ready to fire people. The culture deck says that, at Netflix, they will fire people for the simple reason that they’re just not excellent enough anymore.", "Or they’re excellent at a thing that the company no longer needs.", "And this is brutal, right? Starting a startup is a foxhole experience. It feels like you're part of a family.", "And Patty knew that. And so, she and Reed, they had to come up with a new metaphor. Netflix, it wasn’t a family.", "It’s a team. A pro team, that hires and develops great players. But also, lets them go when they can no longer perform.", "Teams and families both connote cooperation and community. But unlike families, you can get cut from a team.", "And Patty, she got really good at cutting people from the team. She’s had those conversations...", "PATTY: Oh god I don’t know, I mean it goes so far back…", "ALEX: Like the first, tell me an early one where you were like “Oh my god, I have this conversation and I really don’t want to.", "PATTY MCCORD: I'll take somebody on my team, maybe. You know, somebody who worked really, really hard and sorted their resumes and made nice stacks and passed them out, and didn't really understand the technology of what they were recruiting for or the person that they were talking to.", "And when I hired them, I just need somebody to work hard and be friendly.", "PATTY MCCORD: And now I needed somebody who really needed to understand what this team was trying to build.", "And who didn't roll their eyes and go, \"Oh, God. The engineers are so weird!\" Right? I needed somebody to go, \"You know what?", "I just --\" somebody to spontaneously say to me, \"You know I did today Patty? I sat next to somebody writing code for an hour and I watched them.", "ALEX BLUMBERG: Here, I'm gonna play the role. I'm -- I'm -- I'm that person in the H.R. department that was sorting resumes.", "And you have been sort of like fearing the conversation, but knowing that it has to come.", "ALEX BLUMBERG: And you knock on my door. What do you say to me?", "PATTY MCCORD: I say, \"I think you've gotten kind of the vibe that I'm not particularly happy about the way things are going.\"", "PATTY MCCORD: Because -- oh, yeah yeah. Right. \"But I have not.\" And then I'm like, \"Okay, so I haven't been very clear about that.", "So here's the team that I'm trying to build. And I need to have people that really understand the technical people and understand what they're doing and what their timelines are, and what's important to them.", "ALEX BLUMBERG: But I do, Patty. I do. I -- I -- I've -- like, what -- what gives you the sense that I don't know that?", "PATTY MCCORD: Okay, so when you're in the engineering organization right now that you support, can you tell me what the top three technical issues that are facing them are?", "ALEX BLUMBERG: Ahh something about -- latency periods.

They got this right, too. Services that deliver discs by mail have different demand curves from those that stream video content, and they also have very different costs to serve their customers.", "That’s why different pricing schemes make sense.

The net effective price increase, when applied to Netflix’s entire subscriber base, was closer to 20 percent.", "Before July 2011, Netflix had bundled streaming with its core delivery-by-mail service because it was a nascent market and the selection of available videos was limited.", "The market had not been ready for a stand-alone streaming-only business. During that period, Netflix subsidized the development of its streaming business by essentially giving it away to its DVD-by-mail subscribers.", "Later, though, with competition from the likes of Apple and Amazon, that would have to change.", "Of course, nobody likes a price increase, and even after the company finally adjusted its pricing model, there was still a lot of noise from the customer base.", "But, as the dust settles, it has turned out that Netflix lost less than 5 percent of its customers (800,000 out of a subscriber base of nearly 24 million).", "Adjusting its pricing was the right decision, and the company has notably stuck by that decision.", "Brand management.

The equally swift reversal of the decision might have controlled some of the damage, but there has probably been some permanent dilution of brand equity.", "In retrospect, it would have been wiser to find a way to brand both services as Netflix, or if a new brand was necessary, to apply it to the new service.", "Communications. Where do we start? After charting an unerring path for so long with consumers, it was surprising to see Netflix make so many fundamental mistakes on the communications front.", "Some will say that Netflix got its strategy wrong. Others will say the strategy was right but poorly implemented.", "Ultimately, the distinction doesn’t matter; missteps of this magnitude become strategic issues.", "In the meantime, the Netflix debacle offers some important lessons for strategists. First, timing is sometimes the hardest part of strategy to get right.", "Netflix likely judged correctly that its mail business was going to be cannibalized and ultimately replaced by streaming.", "But no one can really know for sure how fast that might happen. Moving too early can be disastrous, as Netflix learned, but moving too late can be even worse — as companies such as Kodak, Research in Motion, and Nokia have discovered.", "Another aspect of timing, the speed of change, is also difficult to master. Netflix sprang its new service on its customers too abruptly.", "Second, strategy should be based on how customers behave, not on what they say. Before Netflix announced its change, customers had posted many online messages about the value of switching to streaming.", "But talk is cheap. Netflix learned this when it began to implement the change, asking customers to switch to a new account if they wanted their videos by streaming instead of mail — and then customers balked.", "Third, when customers have an intense loyalty to a particular product (or service or brand), they become nearly as vested in the product as the company is.", "Coca-Cola Company learned this lesson the hard way in 1985, when it replaced its original flagship cola with a new cola.", "Many of Coke’s most loyal consumers were outraged by its unilateral decision to take away “their” product.", "Likewise, Netflix’s customers were outraged when the company took the Netflix name away from “their” original mail service.", "Finally, strategy has to be dynamic and iterative. Customer reaction to any change in a company’s value proposition is difficult to know a priori, even with the best market research.", "Having the agility to change your choices when new information comes to light is essential to strategy success.", "This type of agility, no matter what mistakes Netflix made, may save the company in the end.

Over time it slowly drove out the creative mavericks who didn’t really want to deal with all that crap.", "The subtle thing is in the short term the business ran better, not worse, because it was very highly optimized.", "Then the market shifted. In that case, it was C++ to Java, but the details don’t really matter. And we were unable to adapt.", "We ended up buying a bunch of companies to have new products for our sales force because we weren’t coming up with them ourselves.", "To do more acquisitions, it gets more complex because you’ve got this other company full of process, and eventually, we drowned.", "And so, I think of process as: it all feels good, but it builds up like barnacles on a boat. If you don’t, every now and then, scrape off the barnacles, then eventually a storm comes, and it sinks the boat.", "We always think about it a little like technical debt, another software metaphor. You’ve got to go in and scrape the barnacles and really try to get rid of process.", "Because I failed in that way in the past, I at least want to fail in a novel way this time.", "Reed: That’s it. We’re pushing super hard into employee freedom, pushing into anti-process, as hard as we can.", "I think of process as: it all feels good, but it builds up like barnacles on a boat. If you don't, every now and then, scrape off the barnacles, then eventually a storm comes, and it sinks the boat.", "-Reed HastingsBen: And to an amazing level. Why write this book now? You also had a co-author, which I thought was interesting.", "It wasn’t the normal co-author ghostwriter. It was almost like, “Well, what’s Reed saying? Yeah, that part is true.", "I was wondering about this part,” that kind of thing. Why that approach?", "Reed: Your books exempted, I have read way too many CEO pontification books, where the CEO says how great things are.", "I always wonder, “What’s the reality? What’s really happening in that company?” Now and then, I’ve got friends who work there, and I can get a beat on it, and it’s almost never what the CEO thinks.", "Of course, I knew that would be true at Netflix, too. So, I thought let me get someone really independent, who is a business school professor and has their own reputation, and give them open access to Netflix.", "They can interview anyone and everyone and report the reality to the reader.", "The book is me pontificating, going through the theory, which I like doing, and then Erin saying, this is her observation of the reality from dealing with all the employees.", "She had formerly written an incredible book “Culture Map,” which is about national cultures within a corporation.", "If you’re a global company, and you have a lot of Koreans and Germans and Brazilians and Dutch and English and Japanese, who are misunderstanding each other, then to read her book “Culture Map” is incredible.", "Ben: Right. And did you end up learning things about Netflix. How did that process go with regards to actually running the company?", "Reed: As you would expect, if you have a good anthropologist spend a lot of time with 100 people, you pick up things – not that they are completely new, but their relative weighting – like the fact that we felt and feel like such an American company.", "I had thought, “Oh, we’re really doing well. I’m becoming pretty global.” And our Korean or our Dutch employees are like, “Wow, this is a super American company.”", "We still have a way to go to get to the Holy Grail where everyone feels they have an equal chance to thrive whether you’re an employee for us in Mexico City or in Mumbai.", "Ben: We’ve been talking about culture, but culture means a lot of different things to a lot of different people.", "It’s a very overloaded word. When you speak of culture in the context of Netflix, what do you mean?", "Reed: I think company culture is the behaviors that get you promoted or get you let go. Everyone, when they go into a company, has to figure out: What’s the real culture?", "What are the values and behaviors that are rewarded, and which ones are violations?", "Sometimes there’s a written culture, and sometimes companies follow that written culture. Other times, there’s a written culture, like Enron famously had respect, integrity, but those weren’t actually what got people promoted.", "What got them promoted was trading profits, and then people cut corners to do that, and eventually, the company blew up.", "In any company, the real culture is shown by who gets rewarded and who gets pushed out.", "In any company, the real culture is shown by who gets rewarded and who gets pushed out. Ben: When you describe the Netflix culture, you do it in a very different way than we’re used to seeing in books.", "Usually a written culture starts with these values, integrity and so forth, but you more describe it as a system.", "There are these pillars in the system: candor, talent density, and rule removal – getting rid of rules.", "They’re interdependent, and then you also speak of layering them. You start with the talent density concept, and then you add a little candor, and then you remove a little rules, and then you cycle through the thing again.", "Increase your talent density, increase the amount of feedback people get, and then you can remove more rules.", "Could you describe why you have this interdependent view of culture that’s so different from the way it’s ordinarily described?", "Reed: Let’s separate two things. There’s what our culture is, and then there’s, if you want to go in this direction, here are some ways to go about it.", "Now, for what a culture is, we try to describe precisely behaviors that are rewarded and that managers can be held accountable for.", "It’s an employee Bill of Rights in a way that’s in our culture memo.", "I picked this up from Jack Welch’s book Winning, Chapter 3. He describes that in the past he put generalities – integrity, communication – but those were not near specific enough.", "He’s now much more long-form and specific about how to approach business problems and how to grow a great business, which is going to be unique for each company.", "You can google Netflix culture and read our current memo, and the 10 behaviors there. That forms two ways.", "One is, it’s us saying to new employees what we want, which helps people select in or select out. It’s also a Bill of Rights that an employee is entitled to see those behaviors rewarded, and if they see that management is inconsistent – and we’re not perfect – compared to those values, it gives them something to refer to and to call us to account.", "The question you brought up with this sort of spiral notion of do a little more. That was really Erin’s innovation as a book device to help people build confidence because it’s pretty hard to go from cultures with a lot of systems and process, to the next week, no process and no rules.", "That’s chaotic. We sat and talked through a way to go about it. It’s a mechanism, or our best guess, on the way an existing company can absorb this set of ideas if they want to.", "Ben: In getting to the Netflix culture, one of the things you talk about that you value is challenging your boss.", "We’re all flawed human beings, including bosses. That’s a behavior you want, but often a boss will not reward that necessarily.", "How does that end up working inside of Netflix, so that you don’t end up with a hypocritical culture where somebody challenges the boss and is punished?", "Reed: Certainly, if they’re punished, that’s going to end all feedback. But even more strongly, because it’s abnormal to criticize the boss, in a way dangerous, the boss has to go out of their way to farm for dissent.", "I do an exercise with our executives: “If you were CEO, what would be different at Netflix?” They have to list the top three things that would be different and that could be: we’d be in China, where we’re not, or it could be, we’re in sports, or it could be we would pay higher or lower, or it could be as trivial as we’d have better food.", "That forces them to say, “If I were CEO what would be different?” That’s one exercise in farming for dissent.", "Then there’s when you’re lucky to get feedback. I’ll laud the person often publicly with their permission: “person X told me this, that was a hard piece of feedback, but it is fair.”", "It’s giving them psychic rewards where other people think, “Oh, that person was gutsy and did that.” At multiple levels, you want to overcome people’s reticence to provide useful feedback to power figures.", "I'll do an exercise with our executives: 'If you were CEO, what would be different at Netflix?' -Reed", "HastingsBen: That’s such a great question, by the way, how would you run Netflix, if you were in my seat?", "It’s just such a great question to get people to speak up on things that would otherwise seem very dangerous.", "With managers, how do you get them to do that, because you’re asking a question, where in some way, emotionally at least, you don’t want to know the answer.", "How does that training work? Is that a difficult thing to get them to do?", "Reed: It’s generally easy to get them to critique pricing strategy or something that’s economic. And it’s harder to get them to say, “Well, if I were CEO, we would have a more empathetic CEO.”", "In other words, personal characteristics. There are things that are product, economic – you can have more films or less TV – that are not personal critiques.", "When you get a personal critique… for me at least, even though I have accomplished all these things, when someone that I respect, one of our executives, in particular, gives me feedback that’s not positive, it hurts.", "I’m like, “Oh my God. No, no, no. You don’t understand.” I’m defensive. And then I just stop myself and remember getting feedback, and the pain, is like doing crunches or push-ups.", "You want to stop, you know it hurts, and you know that it’s the painful ones that make you stronger. Ray Dalio talks a bunch about this.", "If you contain your ego, and if you can take the pain, you’ll get stronger, and you’ll get better as a leader.", "Then instead of arguing with the person, I’ll say, “Tell me more? What else?” And just keep hitting those two, “Tell me more?", "What else?” And it’ll be amazing what comes out. It really hurts, but that’s what makes you better.", "To play on the exercise metaphor, if you’re a trainer for someone and you beat them, that’s not helpful.", "We always want the feedback to be constructive. Yes, we want honesty and candor, but not your drunken self-spouting off random things.", "What we mean is professional, helpful. It can be direct. It can still hurt, but it’s within the bounds of the professional self.", "It’s not critiquing or sharing other things that you might or might not think – I’ll call that your drunk self.", "It’s keeping that stuff to the side. It’s not unleashing that, but it’s making your professional self much more open.", "Another thing we say is don’t say something about a colleague that you haven’t or won’t say to them. If you are working at Netflix at any level and you come to me and say, “You know, Ted Sarandos, my co-CEO, he’s got this, this, and that problem.”", "Then I say, “Well, that’s interesting. What did he say when you told him that?” And then, they will look at me all frozen.", "“Well, I can’t tell them that.” And I’m like, “Yes, you can.” And that’s the first line.", "When people are talking about other colleagues, which is normal and fine, just keep pressing them with, “Oh, and what did they say when you asked them about that?”", "Getting feedback, and the pain, is like doing crunches or push-ups. You want to stop, you know it hurts, and you know that it's the painful ones that make you stronger.", "-Reed HastingsBen: You had a great anecdote in the book about Japan, which has a very pronounced country culture that isn’t that compatible with plain directness in the way that you talk about.", "Reed: Japan, as an island culture and a very cohesive homogeneous culture, has developed a high art form of giving feedback very indirectly.", "They call it “reading the air.” If we’re both Japanese, without saying anything inappropriate verbally, I can give you a bunch of feedback and be very confident you got the message.", "When interacting with Americans, we don’t know that art form, and so they’ll say something and we’re supposed to interpret it as “no way” or “yes” or “I wish you did this differently or that.”", "And we completely miss it because we don’t know how to read the air, and they don’t know that we can’t.", "Two, the Confucian cultures have a high deference to elders, so critiquing anyone in power is doubly hard.", "Then, related to reading the air, if they do critiques in public, that’s triply hard. I say to our Americans, “For a Japanese to receive criticism in public would be like you yelling at them in American culture, where it’s really emotionally charged, and they interpret it that way.”", "What we have to do is help both sides understand each other, and that’s where Erin’s Culture Map book is so good.", "We say, “Look, we standardized on English because it takes too long for the rest of the world to learn Japanese and standardize on that, and we do need one language to communicate.", "In this dimension of giving feedback, we’re going to go with the American style of verbal feedback because we can all learn that around the world.”", "Then what we’ve tried to do is give permission to our Japanese colleagues to do that, including doing dinners where we all have to give feedback to each other.", "What you’re trying to do there is role model the behavior, so that they feel like it’s acceptable.", "To give you another example where we changed the culture – Americans form trust by doing tasks. If you go into a meeting and you barely know another employee, but then you work on a project together, and it’s done well, then you have high trust because you trust their competence.", "We build trust that way, and we see chit chat about kids and baseball teams in a meeting as inefficient.", "Brazilians are very much relationship builders. They want to take meals and really talk about family and society and religion and sports.", "Then, we’ll do the work, and we’ll trust each other at work because we’ve got this basis. They’re different styles.", "What we realized is actually the Brazilian style is more efficient, because if you’ve got a strong relationship with people, then you can give good feedback.", "You have that kind of emotional caring for each other.", "About five years ago, when we started doing a lot of work in Brazil, we realized that we should really shift our culture to be more relationship-oriented.", "And so, we’ll open meetings and talk about parents and kids and animals, sports and news, and we’ll spend 5% or 10% of the time on that, and then we’ll get to the real topics.", "We want a consistent style around the world of expectations, so that managers can be on the same page.", "Ben: And I know it’s coming from a good place because I already had the conversation with you about my kids, and you remembered my kids.", "That ends up being, at a high performing American company, like Netflix, a key cultural element that you run out and grab.", "Reed: That’s right. The strength of the relationship allows the effectiveness of the feedback. The narrow inefficiency of taking that time turns out actually to be well worthwhile.", "Reed: Now, we’re diving into feedback, but we should back up a little bit. For both you and I, we care about how you create long-term companies that continue to innovate.", "We’ve both been shocked at the fall of HP or Sun (Microsystems). We try to figure out what happens to companies when there’s rapid change.", "Most companies over-optimize for efficiency. They want to get so good at their current market that they lose flexibility to adjust to the future.", "And the non-intuitive thing is it’s better to manage chaotically, if that’s productive and fertile.", "Most companies over-optimize for efficiency. They want to get so good at their current market that they lose flexibility to adjust to the future.", "-Reed HastingsThink of the standard model. It’s clean, efficient, sanitary, sterile, and our model is messy and chaotic and fertile.", "And in the long term fertile will beat sterile, but in the short term, sterile is very good.", "You have to be very conscious as a leader how you’re optimizing for long-term innovation. Manufacturing has dominated the economy for 200 years.", "There’s this big influence from manufacturing, because it’s generated most of the economic wealth of the past couple hundred years, around the boss and the worker and the worker following the rules.", "And yet, if you’re an innovation culture, variation is essential. At core, an innovation culture is around increasing variation, and a manufacturing culture, like 5-sigma, is around decreasing variation.", "In manufacturing and in safety – think of hospitals and airlines – you want perfect process, full compliance, and that is the right way to manage those businesses, which are most of the economy.", "Then there’s this creative sector, which we’re both in, and as managers we’ve inherited a cultural legacy that is highly optimized for manufacturing and safety with process, OKRs, and all these ideas to manage creativity, but, in fact, we really need to create a fertile ecosystem and not try to manage it too much, and yet not have it be chaotic.", "There just hasn’t been enough thinking about what’s unique about creative companies. For creative companies, the fundamental risk is lack of innovation – not execution and efficiency, bringing costs down, those kinds of manufacturing things.", "It’s really are you organized for innovation? We’re trying to make a contribution around what would you do to optimize creativity.", "We think that’s around employee freedom, which is supported by the no rules context.", "Other people have other ideas, but they are still about how do you have a company that is able to do new inventions.", "Let’s take Amazon, an incredible company that has done amazing amounts of innovation, arguably more than Netflix.", "They’re not nearly as much as we are about freedom and no rules, but they’re about two pizza lunches, and they’re so willing to fail.", "They can do that whole mobile phone disaster, and then once in a while, they have an Alexa, and it changes the world.", "Over time the innovation sector will see that there’s a couple of different approaches and find the best way to combine them.", "Ben: Yours is very interesting because it is, at its core, a cultural approach. Whereas when I think about Jeff Bezos, he goes into what you said – willingness to take very high risks.", "It gets back, though, to a cultural thing. Is it rewarded in the culture to take that high risk or is it punished when you fail?", "Reed: And Google is a fascinating one because, of course, 10 years ago they were all about 20% time, and now that’s all gone.", "What did they learn? It’s pretty hard to do innovation one day a week. The big innovations that they did are things like Android and Google Drive and Google Docs – massive projects.", "I’m guessing that they probably learned that, “Hey, at Google the way we innovate is we can put hundreds of people on big ideas, and it’s no longer, part-time innovation that matters.”", "Ben: Google’s approach to innovation always seemed to me to be this super courageous, but top-down set of ideas.", "We want to build an autonomous car, and we’re going to put unlimited money for unlimited years into that, and that’s an amazing thing to do.", "But your idea is almost the opposite, which is, “Look, we’ve got all these creative people here, and if we get rid of the rules that constrain their thinking, they will come up with the innovation, and there won’t be any rule against them continuing with that innovation and building it.", "There’s nobody who’s going to say “No” because we don’t have any rules.”", "Reed: In that way, Netflix and Amazon are closer to those bottom-up innovations, but Amazon has more lines of business.", "We’re still basically a one-service company, so we’re earlier in the phase. In Google terms, it’d be as if we only had search.", "Ben: You did run into at Netflix a very important turning point where, if you had continued to optimize the DVD business instead of getting to the streaming business, you would’ve had a huge problem.", "Can you tell us a little bit about that because you also kind of screwed it up? I remember you saying, somewhat thanks to my business partner Marc Andreessen who was very much about eject DVDs and go into the future.", "Reed: Typically, venture capitalists say that you want to go after the largest market possible. I’ve always thought that’s crazy because you can’t defend it.", "Reed: I have always thought you want to go after the smallest market possible that can hold your 5- to 10-year growth ambitions.", "I have always thought you want to go after the smallest market possible that can hold your 5 to 10-year growth ambitions.", "Reed: If it’s the left-handed scissors market, it’s too narrow. The practical thing on how big it is, is can it hold 5 or 10 years of growth?", "So, back to DVD, by the time we got to 2005, we realized that DVD was probably going to peak about 2010.", "It could no longer hold our 5 or 10-year growth ambitions. Then we had to figure out how to expand the market definition.", "We said, “Okay, now is the time. We’ve got to expand into streaming.”", "In 2007, YouTube had just started. Google had just bought it at the beginning of 2007. Hulu started. Amazon did a thing called Unbox, which was their Internet delivery on video, and Netflix started streaming.", "All four of us entered basically in ’07, and since then it’s been a rocket ship.", "Reed: Yes, that’s right. It was a big enough market. There was a play there. And Hulu was doing really well.", "It was owned by three of the major media companies, and to some degree, they were positioning it as: if you care about DVD and streaming, Netflix is okay, but if you really care about streaming, Hulu is the solution.", "Our marketing played into this because the easiest way to differentiate against Hulu was, “Well, we have DVDs, too.”", "The problem was that was going to be a fading value to consumers. We had to say to our marketers, “You can’t talk about it.", "We’ve got to strip it away because you’re going to make us dependent on a thing that’s going to become irrelevant, and we have to be, full stop, the best streaming service and to win on that basis.”", "In fact, we had to have DVD and streaming be separate, so that streaming had to fight and win and be better than Hulu as a streaming service.", "So, partially goaded by the wonderfully radical Marc Andreessen who was like, “burn the boats,” we came up with this plan to separate DVD and streaming.", "We made one tragic mistake in it. The pricing for the combined plan had been $10, and the separate plans we set were $8 for streaming, which was about Hulu’s price, and $8 for DVD.", "It was effectively a 60% price increase. We sent an email to 20 million American families, so 20% of American society, on one day, saying the price is going up by 60%, and you get to use two services, two websites instead of one.", "Less convenience, radically higher price in the middle of a recession.", "Reed: And no new features. It did not go well. I explained it as essential for Netflix’s long-term, which it was.", "Reed: Oh, my God, it was crazy bad. The stock went down 75%. Lots of members quit. Saturday Night Live did skits making fun of us.", "We realized that this was going to be a challenge to get out of, and we slowly had to earn back the trust of customers.", "We basically switched it from Qwikster to DVD.com. Now, if you go to DVD.com, that’s our DVD service.", "We have a little under 2 million members that are still DVD subscribers. We have nearly 200 million who are streaming.", "We were right to separate them. It’s just we did it an awful way.", "We did the thing that Kodak never did, that AOL never did, that Blockbuster never did. We transitioned our business successfully, but we did not stick the landing.", "We did the thing that Kodak never did, that AOL never did, that Blockbuster never did. We transitioned our business successfully, but we did not stick the landing.", "We landed ugly. Ben: One of the things that you talk about in the book is that the knowledge to stick it correctly was in the company, but you just didn’t listen to it.", "Reed: Afterward, we first had to heal. That took six months or a year because it was just a crisis of: What are we going to cut?", "How are we going to survive? Our General Counsel joked that he had worked at Webvan, so at least he had bankruptcy skills.", "After we healed, we said, “Okay, what went wrong?” The first level answer was an arrogant CEO who didn’t listen to his people, a King Lear kind of thing.", "For the most part, that’s not what happened. What happened was something more subtle. Our leading people were too deferential.", "They were like, “Reed’s been right so many times. I think this is going to be bad, but he must see something.”", "They didn’t know that each of them felt the same way. In hindsight, if we had said, “All execs, write down your level of confidence in this move, disaster to genius,” it would’ve come up that 20 people think it’s going to be bad.", "With the strength of their shared feeling, they would’ve realized, “No, we’re right. Reed is wrong.” Then, probably, we would’ve stopped.", "We said, in the future, all major decisions, we will have everybody write down what they think +10 to -10 and why.", "We do that in a Google Sheet, but any shared medium is fine. Then everyone knows what everyone else thinks in writing.", "That little device has helped us avoid chaos and catastrophe.", "Ben: That’s such a great device. It’s very deceiving when you’re a CEO because it’s at the point when you are right consistently and feeling confident that you cause that problem.", "It’s right at the point when you’re doing the best that people put too much faith in you.", "All major decisions, we have everybody write down what they think +10 to -10 and why. That little device has helped us avoid chaos and catastrophe.", "- Reed HastingsBen: If a business was in like a dogfight competitive battle in its current market, would you still drive for innovation or would you need to optimize more for efficiency?", "Reed: Probably a little more optimized. When we were in the DVD fight with Blockbuster in ’05 to ’07, we got distracted doing magic charms.", "We did four things to make ourselves feel better. We went into selling used DVDs directly on our website rather than on eBay.", "We started buying some little films at Sundance, like a Maggie Gyllenhaal film, for original content.", "We launched a private social network called Netflix Friends, and this was 2005, Facebook was barely out of Harvard.", "You could see each other’s queue and viewing history, if you gave each other permissions. And we sold banner advertising on our website, like Overstock used to do.", "It was four nontrivial engineering efforts that to differentiate us against Blockbuster.", "Fortunately, we also spent some time getting shipping more reliable, so our queue fulfillment rate went from 96% to 98%.", "In the end, once we beat Blockbuster, we realized the only thing that mattered was that queue fulfillment rate, the 96% to 98%.", "We, as leaders, did not have the courage to stand before the employees and say, “We’re going to win because we can move this from 96% to 98%.”", "We needed these little magic charms to make ourselves feel good. It was totally bad management to get distracted by those magic charms.", "Having the confidence to focus on the basics and doing the basics incredibly well is important. That lesson is more of a business strategy lesson than a culture lesson, so it’s not in the book, but that lesson is what’s fueled our focus on movies and series and not sports and video games and user-generated content and all kinds of other things.", "It’s always a balance when you’re in that dogfight. You better win the dogfight first, and then you can invent the new airplane.", "Ben: Without tactics sometimes there’s no strategy.", "It's always a balance when you're in that dogfight. You better win the dogfight first, and then you can invent the new airplane.", "Ben: When you think of Netflix’s culture, what parts do you consider to be timeless evergreen relative to the parts you see as open to evolution as you enter new markets and evolve the business?", "Reed: It’s all open to evolution. None of it is golden tablets. We’re constantly trying to improve the culture.", "Most people have the default idea that as you get bigger, you start sucking. It gets political, it gets bureaucratic.", "But if you want to effect the world at scale, you want to grow. You’re making a choice not to be a boutique restaurant in your neighborhood where you’re fantastic, but you don’t change the world.", "Most of us take the trade-off to get bigger, which is harder, because then we can have more impact in the world.", "The key thing is to get people to believe that it’s possible to get better as you get bigger. Then you have to really show the examples of where you’re getting better as you get bigger.", "Now, it is harder as you get bigger, but think of Malthus, who 250 years ago thought the whole world was going to starve once we got to above a billion people.", "Totally wrong. What he didn’t understand is that they’re going to be a lot of people thinking about how to have increased food productivity, and in fact, you’d have less starvation than 250 years ago instead of more.", "Now, as Netflix grows, we have more people thinking about how to improve the culture. Yes, it’s harder, but we’ve got more brainpower working on it, and people are coming up with ideas.", "A big example would be about four years ago, we added inclusion as a core value, and we’ve been working hard on it, and we’ve made real progress.", "I wish that I had led that 10 years ago, but I didn’t. I wish I had led it at all, but it was brought to me as something that really needed to be done.", "I’m on board, and we’re driving it, but it’s a real improvement because we’ve got more people thinking about it.", "Now, of our top 20 leaders, we’re half men, half women. We’re 25% leaders of color in our top 20. That’s been a great improvement that was really driven by all the new talent at Netflix.", "Ben: Really interesting. It is challenging, in particular, getting everybody to participate in a culture at scale.", "It’s probably the greatest management challenge there is.", "Final question, and you had such colorful answers to this in The Wall Street Journal. How has COVID-19 impacted Netflix?", "Do you feel the company is in a better place to react to crises because of its cultural reinvention?", "Reed: I love work from home. I’ve been doing work from home my whole life nights and weekends. I think it’s always a great part of the mix.", "I do think that exclusive work from home, where you don’t have any in-person contact, is not good, but work from home as part of the work experience is fantastic.", "And then, is Netflix differentially able to adapt? Maybe, but I don’t know, and it kind of doesn’t matter, because COVID, fortunately, is a one in 100 years phenomenon.", "We’re not trying to draw great cultural lessons from it. Instead, we’re trying to think of the things that we’ll need to be good at for 5, 10, 20 years.", "We’re all making do. I do hope that we’ll have a vaccine soon, that many people will get it, and that we’ll eliminate COVID from society and be back to normal next year.", "That will be a great day when we can do this interview live in the Commonwealth Club and have some fun.", "Ben: Yeah.

When his company was at the pinnacle of success, just last summer, he refused my repeated requests to discuss his apparent business prowess.", "He claimed to be reticent about being interviewed, disdaining the limelight and the attention it brings to him and his family.", "His low-key, unrehearsed manner—he is prone to gaffes involving hot tubs, among other things—makes it clear he is not having fun when he talks to the media.", "What little publicity he does is only to benefit Netflix. “It’s an appropriate and necessary sacrifice . . .", "but on a personal basis, it’s pure downside, because then you just get more recognized,” he says. “You lead a less normal life.", "But after presiding over perhaps the worst self-inflicted corporate wound since Coca-Cola introduced New Coke, in 1985 (and then promised to continue making the old Coke after a tempest of consumer ire), he finally relented in early December and met me at a Midtown Manhattan hotel.", "He still had on the garish burgundy shirt and tan jacket he had worn earlier in the afternoon during a UBS investor conference.", "Despite his stratospheric Silicon Valley reputation and quasi-billionaire status, he comes across more as the preppy hockey player he once was than the high-tech mogul he has become.", "As if working his way through some sort of corporate 12-step program, Hastings forthrightly admits that the events of the summer were not his or his company’s finest hour, but he believed it was “healthy” for leaders to have “a reservoir of self-doubt, because it’s how you create an internal dialogue and how you check your assumptions.”", "Still, despite the company’s rebound in early 2012 (share prices have nearly doubled since December), many Netflix investors wish Hastings had doubted his instincts a bit more than he did.", "The son of a lawyer who once served in the Nixon administration, Hastings has degrees in mathematics, from Bowdoin College, and artificial intelligence, from Stanford University, but he was never a desk-bound geek.", "After stints with the Marines, the Peace Corps (teaching math in Swaziland), and various software start-ups during the initial Internet boom—when he made a first fortune of around $75 million after selling Pure Software, a debugging company—he co-founded Netflix, in 1997, with Marc Randolph.", "The series of catastrophic missteps in question regarding Netflix started July 12, when—without a whole lot of preparation or warning—the company announced that if its customers wanted to continue receiving the movies and television shows on DVDs that arrive through the mail in Netflix’s signature red envelopes they would have to pay $7.99 a month for the privilege.", "If they wanted monthly access to streaming content over the Internet—no DVDs or mail involved, just instant gratification—the cost would also be $7.99.", "If they wanted access to both DVDs and streaming content, the price would be $15.98 a month ($7.99 plus $7.99), up from a combined monthly price of $9.99.", "“We think $7.99 is a terrific value for our unlimited streaming plan and $7.99 a terrific value for our unlimited DVD plan,” Jessie Becker, Netflix’s vice president of marketing, announced on the Netflix Blog with the typical corporate happy talk that often accompanies really bad news.", "“We hope one, or both, of these plans makes sense for our members and their entertainment needs.”", "Since this was not rocket science, it took about a nano-second for Netflix’s 24 million or so customers to realize that they were being hit with a 60 percent price increase; what had once cost $10 a month would now cost $16.", "Even though the price to see a first-run movie in a theater on the nation’s two coasts averages around $13 per ticket, the social networks and the blogosphere lit up with such instant fury you might have thought Hastings had dropped a nuclear device on his customers.", "Greg Heitzmann, a University of Missouri graduate, was typical of the nearly 13,000 people who went on the Netflix Blog to express their anger: “To say the least, I am shocked and appalled at your recent behavior,” Heitzmann wrote.", "“Your nominal price increase, while unexpected, does not deter my loyalty. However, your mouthpiece Jessie Becker’s presentation of this upcharge—as an added choice for my own benefit—insults my intelligence and reveals the breadth of your arrogance.", "Had I been treated like an adult and informed of these changes in a straightforward, honest manner, perhaps we could rekindle our spark.", "Unfortunately, this course of action is no longer available; your condescending and manipulative tone has irreparably ruined our relationship.”", "Heitzmann canceled his subscription. He was not alone. More than 800,000 Netflix subscribers dropped the service within months of the July announcement.", "As customers continued to flee, Hastings leapt into the fray to try to explain. “I messed up,” he wrote on the Netflix Blog on September 18.", "“I owe everyone an explanation. It is clear from the feedback over the past two months that many members felt we lacked respect and humility in the way we announced the separation of DVD and streaming, and the price changes.", "That was certainly not our intent, and I offer my sincere apology.”", "“We weren’t doing the price change to raise profits or something,” he elaborated to me. “We were doing it because we were so focused on becoming the streaming company and the global streaming company that we always wanted to be, and always have wanted to be.”", "He said that he sees the future of Netflix similarly to how big telephone companies see their futures in wireless, rather than in landline, phones.", "“Most companies that are great at something—like AOL dialup or Borders bookstores—do not become great at new things people want (streaming for us) because they are afraid to hurt their initial business,” he wrote on the blog.", "Hastings took the blame for the failure to communicate better with customers. “In hindsight, I slid into arrogance based upon past success,” he wrote.", "“But now I see that given the huge changes we have been recently making, I should have personally given a full justification to our members of why we are separating DVD and streaming, and charging for both.", "It wouldn’t have changed the price increase, but it would have been the right thing to do.”", "But with the mea culpa behind him, he proceeded to make matters even worse, by announcing that the DVD-by-mail service would be split off from the streaming service and renamed Qwikster—“because it refers to quick delivery,” he explained—with its own Web site and its own C.E.O. The streaming service would still be called Netflix and be the focus of the company’s energy and its future growth.", "There would be no more price increases—“We’re done with that!”—but keeping both services would now be even more cumbersome, requiring two separate accounts, two separate monthly credit-card charges, and twice as much effort as before.", "“So if you subscribe to both services, and if you need to change your credit card or email address, you would need to do it in two places,” he announced.", "“Similarly, if you rate or review a movie on Qwikster, it doesn’t show up on Netflix, and vice versa.”", "With that, he said, he hoped to regain the trust of his customers.", "Accompanying this surprising announcement was a lame video of Hastings along with Andy Rendich—the presumptive new C.E.O. of Qwikster.", "Hastings was rocking the casual look in a Gap T-shirt underneath some sort of flimsy, ill-fitting teal work shirt.", "His Oakley sunglasses rested in front of him on his IBM ThinkPad. At one point, he flubbed a line and repeated it—a homey touch that remained in the video.", "He observed correctly on the Netflix Blog, “You’ll probably say we should avoid going into moviemaking after watching it.”", "Faster than you could say “Qwikster,” the amateur video became fodder for the late-night comics. Conan O’Brien spoofed it with a parody video that claimed returning a Netflix DVD was now as easy as just throwing the red envelope out of a moving-car window or putting it in a hedge or flushing it down the toilet.", "“Don’t worry, we’ll get it,” he cracked. Saturday Night Live recorded its own parody of the Hastings/Rendich video—replete with the goofy attire—and released it on the Internet.", "(Hastings believes it wasn’t funny enough for the actual show, although it was pretty darn funny.) Then a fake Hastings appeared in another S.N.L. spoof, of a Charlie Rose show.", "After Rose asks Hastings if Netflix and Apple could be compared, Hastings says, “Comparing Apple to Netflix is like comparing apples to oranges, especially if the oranges made so many mistakes that people stopped eating oranges and just went back to Blockbuster.”", "Hastings’s screwups were taking their toll not only on Netflix’s customer base but also on its financial prospects.", "Fewer customers meant less revenue and cash flow at the very moment Netflix’s ambitions required larger and more expensive deals with the Hollywood studios that provide the content to stream.", "For more than a year, Netflix’s stock had been a rocket ship as nearly every one of the company’s pronouncements had been met with dizzying investor approval.", "For instance, after the company announced on the morning of July 5, 2011, that it was set to offer its services in 43 Latin American and Caribbean countries—a potential new broadband customer base estimated at 45 million people—the stock jumped from $268 per share to an all-time high of $291 per share and a market capitalization of more than $15 billion.", "Shortly thereafter, the stock hit nearly $305 per share. A year earlier, it had been at $117; two years ago, it was at $40.", "That Netflix traded at a price-to-earnings ratio of more than 80 times its historical earnings seemed to be lost on most investors.", "But after Hastings’s missteps, the stock went into free fall, dropping to $113 per share in early October, from $210 in the second week of September.", "It would hit a low of $62 a share in November. The few—but vocal—short investors (someone who bets a stock’s price will fall and then does what he can to make that happen) and research analysts who had long felt the stock was grossly overvalued and overhyped were wallowing in Schadenfreude.", "Finally, on October 10, Hastings pulled the plug on Qwikster. The explanatory blog post was short and sweet.", "“It is clear that for many of our members two websites would make things more difficult, so we are going to keep Netflix as one place to go for streaming and DVDs,” he wrote.", "“This means no change: one website, one account, one password . . . in other words, no Qwikster.”", "And not a moment too soon. Some $12 billion of Netflix’s market capitalization had been wiped out, and some Hollywood suppliers to Netflix had begun to wonder if the company could continue to pay its bills on time.", "Wall Street’s faith in the company was shattered. People were calling for Hastings’s head. Things were looking so desperate that on November 22—after not having bothered to tap the capital markets when the stock was at or near its all-time high—Netflix raised a fresh $400 million in equity: $200 million from a longtime investor, Technology Crossover Ventures, and another $200 million from public investors at $70 a share.", "This was seen as a sign by some that the company was strapped for cash.", "The question lingers how Hastings, who sits on the boards of both Microsoft and Facebook, could have made such spectacular blunders.", "Just a year earlier, Fortune had put him on its cover as its “Businessperson of the Year.” His three appearances on Charlie Rose—in 2005, 2006, and 2011—were treated as the Second Coming.", "Had Hastings come to believe in his own invincibility? Was this a case of pride going before the fall?", "Or a failure to listen to advice? Or was this a simple failure of public relations?", "In an October 24 article in The New York Times, Hastings recalled that he had been soaking in a hot tub with a friend (Hastings lives in Santa Cruz with his wife and two teenage children, after all) when he shared with him the news that Netflix planned to separate the DVD business from the streaming business.", "“That is awful,” his friend responded. “I don’t want to deal with two accounts.” But Hastings “ignored the warning, believing that chief executives should generally discount what their friends say.”", "Now he admitted that he had been “guilty of overconfidence and of ‘moving too quickly,’” and “hubris,” even.", "The harsh reaction from his customers was due to the “angry mood of the country,” he said, citing both the Tea Party and Occupy Wall Street political movements.", "He again clarified that he did what had to be done. “We still need to move quickly in streaming,” he said.", "That same day he told investors on Netflix’s third-quarter earnings call that the decision to create Qwikster was “hard to justify” and that after the price increase “Qwikster became the symbol of Netflix not listening.”", "He reiterated that “we quickly changed course on that. And we are going to stick with DVD as part of the Netflix brand.", "And going forward we will be very aggressive on promoting streaming Netflix and the benefits, and anyone who wants to also subscribe to DVDs will be very welcome, but we are going to be pushing and promoting streaming.”", "If their critics are now legion, Hastings and Netflix retain the unequivocal support of many of the Hollywood studios, of which Netflix has become an increasingly important customer.", "“They continue to be a good partner for us,” says Philippe Dauman, the C.E.O. of Viacom. “Reed is a guy who’s smart, who takes calculated risks, and when something goes awry, he admits it, and he moves forward.", "The subscriber count is stabilized, and actually Reed mentioned that to me when I saw him recently. It’s still a great service.", "They keep acquiring more content, which makes it more valuable to their customers. In my mind they continue to have a good consumer proposition, and of course they raised some capital, so they’re on very solid ground.”", "Explains Ron Meyer, the longtime head of Universal Studios, “When you have the resources they have and the reach that they have—we’re all looking for new revenue streams—they’re the newest and most exciting, and biggest.”", "How important a customer is Netflix to Universal? “On a scale of 1 to 10, they’re a 10,” Meyer says.", "Les Moonves, the president and C.E.O. of the CBS Corporation, thinks Hastings and Ted Sarandos, 47, Netflix’s chief content officer, whose portfolio is dealing with Hollywood, are two of the smartest people in the industry.", "“Our goal as a content provider is to get paid in as many ways as we possibly can,” says Moonves. “And the reason we welcomed Netflix into the marketplace is they’re paying us in a brand-new way that opens up many horizons for the future.”", "And that future may include CBS-produced original content for Netflix, Moonves announced on a conference call this month.", "Jeffrey Katzenberg, the C.E.O. of DreamWorks Animation, is perhaps Hastings’s biggest booster, claiming that Hastings is one of the few in Silicon Valley who truly deserves being called a visionary.", "“He has shown a great sense of being able to adapt to a rapidly changing world of how people want to see movies and how they value great movie and television content being brought to them, and how their habits are changing,” he says.", "Katzenberg thinks Hastings proved to be an effective leader during the summer: “He has shown two of the most exceptional qualities of a great C.E.O. and leader, which is first recognizing how his business is transforming and being very aggressive about innovating and adapting to those changes as they’re going on.", "It’s just he, I think, moved too far ahead of the transition from hard goods to digital. There’s no question whatsoever what he was pursuing is in fact what ultimately is going to prevail.", "And the fact that he did it a beat too soon I think is the only mistake.", "“Quality number two,” Katzenberg says, “is that, having made a very bold and important and looking-into-the-future decision and then seeing that he got ahead of his customers, he did again what others find so difficult to do, which is acknowledge the mistake, fix it, and reset the business back.", "There may have been an awkwardness in the process of doing it, but those decisions were bold, smart, and imperative.", "What those short-term knocks are has just made him and the company smarter and stronger.”", "All of this praise is simply too much for Rocco Pendola, one of the most outspoken “shorts” on Netflix’s stock, who unleashed a November 28 tirade against the company on the Seeking Alpha blog.", "Pendola had been reading Haruki Murakami’s latest book, 1Q84, and he concluded that, like Aomame, the main character in the novel, “I must be living my own reality separate from [Netflix] bulls.”", "He wrote that he could not understand why, despite the separation fiasco and the near collapse of the stock, any number of publications and research analysts were still trumpeting Netflix as an investment.", "“Simply put, these moves that Reed Hastings made represent nothing more than desperate reactions to a broken business model,” he wrote.", "He then wondered why, if Netflix’s business fundamentals were so good, it had suddenly decided to raise $400 million in new equity—what another blogger called “a desperate cash grab” with absolutely horrible terms.", "Pendola called “comical” the explanation from Steve Swasey, Netflix’s V.P. of corporate communications, that, while the company had no “pressing need” for the cash, “it’s always nice to have more money than you need.”", "Concluded Pendola, “If you cannot clearly read the writing on the wall after everything that’s happened, you deserve to lose your money and average this dog down as it craters to below book value.", "Or, as Murakami stated so well: ‘If you can’t understand it without an explanation, you can’t understand it with an explanation.’”", "One of Pendola’s heroes is Tony Wible, who since 2008 has been the media-and-entertainment research analyst for Janney Montgomery Scott, a small Philadelphia-based brokerage that wouldn’t know a tarp loan if it were hit over the head with one.", "Wible could not be more different from Hastings. At 35 he is chunky and balding but with the irrepressible confidence of youth.", "Wible used to work for Citigroup—until that company almost went under during the financial crisis—and for years his cubicle was outside the office of Jack Grubman, the infamous telecom analyst who specialized in trading favorable research reports for hundreds of millions of dollars of investment-banking revenue.", "Grubman, who was paid more than $48 million between 1999 and 2001, pumped up the stock of WorldCom during the years before that telecom company imploded in an ocean of accounting shenanigans.", "“I vividly and painfully remember those days,” Wible says. “Having gone through seeing what happened with WorldCom, having seen what’s happened with other companies, I feel like you can’t fully trust management.", "You have to look at what the numbers tell you, and nobody’s going to tell you in advance if something’s not working.", "I’m sure the guys at Enron and WorldCom would have said everything’s fine. They’re never going to say they’re not fine.", "I don’t know of any management team that ever goes out proactively to say that things aren’t working or when they’re not going to work.”", "When it comes to Netflix, Wible sees red flags everywhere. On June 14 he issued a rare “sell” rating on Netflix’s stock, when it was trading at around $257 per share.", "(Only 2 percent of Janney’s research reports carry a “sell” rating, and, unlike analysts at both Goldman Sachs and Citigroup, he knows his company won’t be doing investment banking with Netflix anytime soon.)", "Wible estimated that the true value of Netflix’s stock was then $170 per share, or one-third less than where it was trading.", "Wible claimed the company was using two accounting gimmicks to prop up its profitability: not properly amortizing the cost of buying its streaming content (the value of which it was depreciating twice as slowly as that of its DVD content) and doubling the amount of time it took to pay its bills.", "Both of these, he claims, allowed Netflix to overstate the amount of cash flow it generated in 2010, when it reported $118 million in “free cash flow”; Wible figures the company really lost $12 million, and its cash flow has declined for three of the past four quarters that preceded 2012.", "The lower cash flow spells trouble, according to Wible, since Netflix is having to pay more and more for its content as well as for the increased broadband usage of its subscribers.", "The only way it can counter this double whammy is either to raise prices or to increase the number of its subscribers to 60 percent (from its current 30 percent) of homes with broadband by the first quarter of 2012, which it was unable to do.", "But higher prices were likely to result in fewer subscribers—he predicted correctly—not more.", "Wible was also bothered by the sudden resignation of Netflix C.F.O. Barry McCarthy, in December 2010, who had spent the previous year selling his Netflix stock, worth $58 million.", "And, worse, he believes, Hastings had been continuously selling his stock for several years, some $81 million worth, according to S.E.C. filings—“although we are encouraged to see that he has stopped selling stock as of early October,” says Wible.", "In December 2011, Netflix announced that Hastings’s total compensation for 2012 would be $2 million, 43 percent below his 2011 compensation of $3.5 million.", "The Netflix executives disagree with nearly every one of Wible’s arguments. According to them, Netflix is not stretching payables.", "It is not misleading anyone about its accounting. (Netflix’s Web site provides a clumsy explanation.)", "It will be able to continue to grow its subscriber base both in the United States and in foreign countries.", "The C.F.O. left because he wanted to pursue a C.E.O. role. (He now works for a venture-capital firm.)", "They don’t waste a moment worrying about the stock price; instead, they spend their time thinking about how to improve their business and how to serve their customers better.", "Yes, they will pay more for content in the future, but only in a way that makes financial sense for the company and for its subscribers.", "As for his ongoing stock sales, Hastings says, “I think the message that it sends is the C.E.O. is prudent.", "I think investors want companies to be led by prudent people, and I should have a stake in the company for sure.", "I have a huge stake, but you want it to be led by someone who’s also prudent.”", "On November 22, with Netflix’s stock down to around $75 per share, Wible issued another “sell” rating with a new price target of $49 per share.", "He sums up the core problem with Netflix’s business model this way: “If they didn’t position it as a cheap rental service, they probably wouldn’t have gained as much market share, but by positioning it as a cheap rental service, they’re probably not able to take up pricing as much.", "And what I have maintained is that Reed is a smart guy, but I believe that he’s managing to the best of bad outcomes.”", "In recent weeks, following a better-than-expected fourth-quarter 2011 earnings announcement (which saw 220,000 new streaming-only customers and a profit of $52 million in that segment), Netflix’s stock has rebounded to around $124 per share.", "The bears remain incredulous. “What we have here is a momentum stock divorced from its underlying company’s reality,” Pendola wrote January 27 on the Seeking Alpha blog.", "“It would not shock me in the least to see [Netflix] move on air back to $300 a share before its next earnings report.", "At some point, however, the same thing that happened in 2011—a full-on implosion—will take shape sooner, rather than later.”", "Added Wible, in a recent e-mail, “Seems like we are back to 2010 again.”", "By the time Hastings made his first-ever appearance at UBS’s annual global-media-and-communications conference, in Manhattan on December 6, the room was packed with investors wondering what he would say next.", "“Last year, you couldn’t take a step without people asking about Netflix,” one investor remarked. “This year, everyone is here for the funeral.”", "Seated at the front of the room, Hastings took his lumps and tried to move on. “Last year, you were the talk of the conference, I believe,” said Aryeh Bourkoff, the head of investment banking for the Americas at UBS, by way of introduction.", "“I think there was a combination of mystique and envy and fear—”", "“Now it’s just pity,” Hastings quickly interjected.", "During our interview, Hastings insisted on putting the whole mess into perspective. “When I look at the challenges that Gandhi had, or the various leaders through history, our challenges pale in comparison to this,” he said.", "“Over the last 10 years, I’ve read a ton about Winston Churchill and Abraham Lincoln. I’ve worked very hard, but my life’s always been fun.", "It’s not been the Civil War of 1862. That was dark, and how you hold things together at a time like that is completely different than what we experienced.", "When we had our stumble—in comparison to a health crisis—I slept well every night.

Just a year ago, John Landgraf, chief executive of Fox-owned US network FX, said there was “too much TV” and there is talk of a dangerous bubble in spending on quality drama, with much of the blame laid at Netflix’s door.", "“He thinks there is too much, he can do something about it,” says Hastings of Landgraf’s comment. “He can produce less, but we are going to produce more.”", "Could it become unsustainable for traditional media companies to up what they pay for content under pressure from new entrants?", "“I’m not sure for them, they might have to cut back, but we are going to grow. It’s sustainable because the new content helps us grow ...", "I’m not sure about in their model, if they are complaining about it they can fix their side, our side is working fine.”", "Netflix is not the only new player in town pushing up prices, and when it came to the show being made by the former Top Gear trio Jeremy Clarkson, James May and Richard Hammond the company was outbid by someone with far, far deeper pockets, Amazon’s Jeff Bezos.", "A Netflix executive last year said Amazon had spent too much, before backtracking rapidly. Is Hastings worried about losing out?", "“We bid on Jeremy Clarkson’s show and they bid more,” says Hastings. “By the time they won it, we were like ‘Wow, that’s a lot of money.’", "Maybe it’ll work for them, it might well. It could be a great show. You can’t tell until you’ve seen it.", "We lost on that one, there’s other ones we won. They are in the bidding, but so is Hulu in the US, so is HBO, we were bidding [against] Channel 4 for Black Mirror.”", "“Our spending the $5bn or $6bn is a fraction of the total industry spend. If Amazon spend a couple of billion it’s in a pool that is very large when you add up all the different networks and what they are spending on scripted entertainment around the world.", "I use Amazon all the time – I am a Prime user, when they have a good show I’ll watch that – but my sense is that they are just one more competitor amongst many.”", "That Hastings jokes with Page and competes with Bezos is not entirely surprising. Though Netflix started out as a mail order rental service, he is very much a techie.", "He founded software company Pure in the 90s and sits on Facebook’s board. He is also part of the Giving Pledge campaign championed by Microsoft’s founder Bill Gates and Facebook’s Mark Zuckerberg, which commits some of the world’s richest people to donate most of their wealth to good causes during their lifetime (education is Hastings’ chosen cause).", "And at Netflix it is not Hastings but Ted Sarandos, the company’s chief content officer with what Hastings calls a “golden gut”, who makes the calls on which shows to buy, even if he is guided by algorithms and the occasional bit of data insight from his CEO.", "Another thing Hastings shares with his tech peers is his belief in constant growth. His content costs from both original commissions and the many billions in commitments to licences for older shows will be familiar to any long-serving LA TV exec, but his faith that as long as his subscriber numbers keep growing he’ll be able to keep spending is straight out of Silicon Valley.", "It’s not an unreasonable strategy, but recent numbers have disappointed. In its second quarter Netflix added just 160,000 memberships in the US and 1.52m internationally – compared with a forecast of 500,000 extra US members and 2m internationally – taking it to a total of 83 million members worldwide.", "The markets were unimpressed and the company’s share price dived.", "“It’s been volatile since we started,” he says of the share price. “The initial thing is we went public on the dollar, within six months we were down to 50c.", "We are trading about where we were before earnings. Everyone realises that internet video is the future.", "I don’t think [the markets] are worried, but there was disappointment about us having less growth than we expected.", "That’s definitely true, but it’s just one quarter. The key in success is thinking long term and not worrying over one quarter.”", "While growth in the US is slowing, its international expansion is doing well, and though it may not have many subscribers in Syria or North Korea, it claims to be in all but one market globally.", "But that market is the world’s largest, China, where it has faced the same political barriers as other western media and technology companies.", "“The Chinese government just closed down the Disney movie service. And they closed down Apple’s movie service.", "Those are two pretty sophisticated, relative to China, companies. It looks like the government just doesn’t want the foreign content distribution.", "Maybe someday in the future there’ll be an opportunity for us in China, it’s possible. We are continuing to work on it.”", "Another growth area often mooted for Netflix is sports and news, yet Hastings is dismissive of both. “Every incremental million dollars we spend, we want to strengthen our movies and TV shows.", "No to sports, and no to news. We want to do better movies and TV shows.” It’s a tactic that has worked so far, and Hastings is banking on the world’s appetite for top-notch TV being far from sated."]}

This is really fun. When we were discussing what episode to do for this one, we were like, okay, we're getting kind of towards the end of season three.", "We want to do like a big important, splashy episode. Let's do one of the Fang companies. Netflix. I thought, you know, Netflix seems pretty straightforward, like Reed Hastings, like a solid dude, you know?", "For sure, but like very, you know, it doesn't seem controversial like this seems pretty straightforward.", "As always with these companies, once acquired shows up on the seed, there is so much more to the story.", "There is stop teasing us and go in there. That right. All right. Okay, so as we mentioned upfront, this is part one.", "We're going to cover Netflix from founding through about 2009 on this episode, part two. Next time we're going to go 2010 to the present, but let's start with the founding.", "So, as I was alluding to, most people know or think they know the founding story of Netflix. Nothing too controversial.", "We go back to 1997 a successful former enterprise software guy from Santa Cruz of all places, uh, is fed up with movie rental, late fees.", "Uh, these are the VHS days still and kind of sees the power of the coming wave of. The internet sees Amazon that's taking off, sees the potential to disrupt bricks and mortar retail and starts what would become Netflix and becomes himself, you know, Paragon of Silicon Valley statesman.", "Of course, I'm talking about Mark Randolph, not Reed Hastings. This is a truth. Statement, the illustrious CEO of Netflix, the illustrious CEO of Netflix was I, I texted Ben when we started researching this and reading Netflix.", "The parallels to Tesla here are like unreal. It's pretty awesome. So Mark Randolph, the reason that is true is he was the CEO of Netflix for the first year while Reed Hastings was finishing up a graduate school at Stanford.", "Yes, but really he was the founder and CEO of Netflix. I think it was closer to two, but we'll have to go through my notes here as we, as we dig through.", "Let me give you two other wild Marc Randolph facts from his background. One is that he helped to found Macworld magazine.", "Yes. Love that. And two is he is currently on the board of Chubbies shorts.", "Yes, yes. And um, Looker, I believe the analytics tool and, and liquor actually came out on Netflix, I think, which would make sense.", "Okay. So here is the official story. If you'll listen to Reed Hastings, he listened to Netflix, the, the official founding story, the lore.", "We're going to give you that. Then we're going to tell you the true story.", "So. Official story. Reed Hastings, he has been a successful technology entrepreneur in the enterprise space, and he has an epiphany for what would become Netflix.", "He's returning an overdue movie to his local video store. Now, originally, the version of this story that he would tell is he was returning it to a blockbuster.", "That gets changed not to a blockbuster after a lawsuit between blockbuster and Netflix. And you know how your founding story can just change.", "Yes. Just how can just not know. Just change whether it was true or not. We've seen this many times, so he's returned the movie to the local video store and he's so fed up.", "He comes up with this magical subscription model alternative when he's on a treadmill at the gym. This isn't just like, Lord, like I'm actually here.", "I'm going to quote from Reed Hastings saying in print to fortune magazine in 2009. Quote, the Genesis of Netflix came in 1997 when I got this late fee, about $40 for Apollo 13.", "Remember Apollo 13? So good, great film. Uh, I remember the fee because I was embarrassed about it. That was back in the VHS days, and it got me thinking that there's a big market out there.", "I didn't know about DVDs. And then a friend of mine told me they were coming and I ran out to tower records in Santa Cruz, California, and mailed CDs to myself.", "Just a disc in an envelope. It was a long, 24 hours until the mail arrived back at my house. I rip them open and they were all in great shape.", "That was the big excitement point. Another, another fun element on this story is the reason that he talks about being on the treadmill is because, uh.", "He also talks about how the gym memberships you pay monthly, whether you sort of use it or not.", "And he was like, Oh, I can totally apply that. It was like the very same day that I was upset about my late fee for Apollo 13 I happened to be going to the gym later thinking about their business model.", "And it's like this completely convoluted, apocryphal story invented purely to explain like what is the Netflix business model and what was the opportunity to be found.", "You know, we, we've talked about this a bunch on this show, but like, I actually don't think there's anything wrong with this because especially in the.", "Early days of a company, you need to communicate your value prop and stories are how you do that. So, um, you know, this is like this happened.", "Yeah. So, okay. What's the real story? One note as we dive in here, it is helpful to be familiar with Bay area geography when discussing, uh, Netflix.", "So for those of you who are, you will intimately understand this. For those of you who aren't, we will try and guide you along the way.", "So it was 1997. Reed Hastings was involved, but as also of course, was Mark Randolph, and they knew each other because they worked together at a company called pure atria, uh, formerly pure software in Sunnyvale, California, which merged with atria.", "Which merged with atria. Yeah. So what was, what was this company? Uh, it was a publicly traded company.", "It made bug detection software for developers, tools company. Ben, we should also say this was Reed Hastings.", "He founded this company also. He founded pure software and for Reed, this was his second job. He did a job for three years and then decided I'm going to start a company.", "David, I don't know if you're, are you going to touch on his, his background before starting pure. Not really.", "So go for it. All right. So, uh, Reed Hastings is like an unbelievable human being. So he went to school to join the Marines and ended up dropping out instead to completely flip tracks and join the peace Corps.", "And after we finished the peace Corps, went and took his first job, then his, his second job was starting pure, and in between, he did a master's in CS at Stanford.", "I think he went to Boden undergrad on these coasts. Um, but yeah, that's it. That's how we got out to the Valley.", "It was sort of predicated on a simple notion that he had around building a better debugger. He's starting to amass a large team.", "You know, they're, they're taking all this money, they're getting ready to go public. He tells the board, Hey, I want to not be CEO of this company.", "You know, it's kind of like, I think for the benefit of myself and all the other shareholders, we really should get a CEO right.", "The board says, no, you should remain CEO. And he ends up basically learning on the fly and then, you know, six successfully manages to both IPO this company and then merge it with atria.", "Such like the opposite of what was usually what boards were usually doing at that age, which was firing CEOs as soon as they humanly kid are firing founders.", "Okay. So. As Ben alluded to, pure atria. At this point, it's publicly traded. It's basically a rollout.", "They had acquired atria. They'd acquired a bunch of companies that are all in the space.", "They're rolling up and consolidating. Randolph. Marc Randolph had been at one of the companies, small companies that pure atria had acquired.", "Um, and after the acquisition, he read a, kind of, takes a liking to him and he gets promoted. He becomes head of marketing for the whole combined company.", "So it's 1997. One final piece of this roll up has happening though, and that's the biggest piece, which is there's a huge merger that's about to happen between pure and rational software.", "Um, which is the biggest competitor in the space. They've just announced they're going to merge public to public merger.", "It is actually going to be the largest merger in Silicon Valley history at that point in 1997 valued at just under a billion dollars.", "Yeah. Cute. Cute. Just under a billion dollars. Um, and Reed Hastings is finally going to get his wish.", "He's going to be fired as CEO, not fired, but he's, he's going to be redundant.", "He's not going to stay with the company. Uh, neither is Randolph. And it's interesting to note here. Uh, Hastings is really bummed about what has happened to the culture.", "And it's important to think about as we talk about Netflix later. Hasting says that pure, like a lot of these other companies went from being a heat filled.", "Everybody wants to be here place to a drone, ish. And I'm quoting here, when does the day end? Sausage factory.", "And he says, we got more bureaucratic as we grew. Um, and, and his. Thinking at that time is whatever I do in the future with the next thing I have to start, we have to think of systems so that we don't end up like that.", "And that will come back into play. Read is about to become hugely wealthy. Like he's still very young, hugely wealthy, and his plan is to basically ride off into the sunset.", "He's reapplied to Stanford, um, this time to do the graduate program and education, which is a fantastic program by the way.", "A lot of people do GSB and, uh, the education masters jointly Reid's going to go do.", "This when your grad program and education with the intention of he's going to become an education focused philanthropist for the rest of his life.", "Randolph though he, he's not so, you know, not about to become so wealthy, he, he has to keep working.", "So he decides what he wants to do is he wants to start a company and he really admires Amazon, which is public at this point, been around for a few years and he thinks.", "That there's a really good opportunity to do. Just like Bezos was thinking, he was looking at all the categories he could attack.", "He chose books. Randolph thinks, well, I can just use another category and run the same Amazon playbook, and it just so happens that in addition to working together, Reed and Mark both live in Santa Cruz.", "So this is, I said, Bay area geography is going to become important. Santa Cruz is a sleepy little university slash beach slash surfer town over the Santa Cruz mountains, which separate, uh, Silicon Valley.", "Uh, the Valley is on the. Inland side of the mountains from the Pacific ocean. Santa Cruz is on the ocean side.", "The mountains are awesome and it's beautiful, but like they're very high and it is very remote. Like if you live in Santa Cruz, you do not live in Silicon Valley.", "And it takes about an hour to commute back and forth. But just like the whole vibe is like beach town surfer town, not, not, you know, everything we think of is Silicon Valley.", "So as a result, Reed and Mark are often carpooling. Together, back and forth between Sunnyvale where pure is based and Santa Cruz.", "And so Randolph just starts like spit balling ideas with Reed during their car rides. He's like, what about this category?", "What about that category? What about that category?", "And he's convinced he wants to do this. So he starts a shell company. He calls it kibble inc because the idea is get the dogs to eat the dog food.", "So kibble inc dog food. Yeah. Anyway. Um, he starts a shell company. They're spitballing stuff. He starts thinking about, has been alluded to.", "He had also worked in the direct mail industry. That's how he got into marketing. He's presumably, we don't know this for a fact, but because of that, very familiar with the AOL prodigy, CompuServe customer acquisition techniques that I think we've referred to it in the past of a, just mailing out tons and tons of CDs to potential customers.", "I mean, how many. AOL CDs. Did you have mailed to your house back in the day? Oh my gosh. And the best thing was, every time you'd go to like a movie theater or something, there just be another box full of them at the desk, the whole country in like, you know, when would this been?", "AOL coasters fall somewhere now. Well, the important thing that I want to say about Aranoff here is it basically his background, but you know, before pure atria, he's a publishing guy.", "He knows the publishing industry inside and out and kind of stacked on top of that. He's a. Data and analytics guy, which didn't really exist in meaningful form.", "You know, there was no digital data and analytics then, so he was frequently tasked with things like serving audience and trying to understand who are our readers, his philosophy as he spitballing a lot of these different ideas here is thinking about.", "How can we automatically, probably through the user interface of some product, build a data and analytics suite, and how can we build sort of intelligence into the UI to automatically do things that make the experience of consuming better?", "It's funny to see all these different threads that become massive pillars of Netflix today, um, that are in sort of the backgrounds of these founders is that those become the pillars of, of Netflix from.", "Mark Randolph's history and background to Netflix today. So inspired by this, he hears about this coming new video format called DVD.", "It's just just getting launched. It's in the movie studios and electronics manufacturers are just rolling it out to being launched in a few test markets.", "Um, and of course DVDs. Come on. Optical disks that are the same form factor as a CD. And so Randolph's like, Oh, well, maybe we can, uh, mail these things.", "Um, so they do go, he does go to, um, a local record store and not tower records in Santa Cruz, uh, buys a CD, goes to a gift card, buys a, um.", "Very like large, like birthday card and stuff's the CD in it and mails it to Reed Hastings house. The next day or two when they're meeting to commute together.", "Reed's got the mayor, he's got the envelope and he's like, it came, it's fine.", "Did this, this blew my mind when I read this story. Today. When we think about the old Netflix, we're like, Oh man.", "It started in that era of DVDs as if it was so long ago. It started before DVDs and they had to proxy like, can we mail DVDs by mailing a CD?", "Because neither of them had ever touched a DVD before when they had this idea.", "I mean, talk about like being on the very tip of a wave and then a, and then sort of riding it the whole way.", "Like they were betting that DVD was going to succeed and that cause the, they evaluated what this work with tapes and they were like, Nope, shipping costs are too high.", "Shipping costs are too high, and just logistically like he got store them and cattle, like the CDs are tiny, although not as tiny as bits.", "So Netflix, it's, it's boring. It's off to the races. So, so what happens, read is like, great. I'm going off to Stanford.", "Um, but I've got all this money. I think I'm going to dabble in angel investing. Um, I'll fund this company.", "So, uh, just like Ilan did with Tesla, uh, Reed leads the first round of funding in kibble, inc, uh, which, uh, in a little bit becomes Netflix, read, invest $2 million.", "Randolph becomes, the CEO read is just an investor. And on the board, they recruit the initial team. They set up their first office in Scott's Valley, which is still on the Santa Cruz side of the mountains.", "Just a little bit. North of the town of Santa Cruz. And the idea is, yep, we're running the Amazon playbook, except instead of attacking borders and Barnes and noble, we are attacking blockbuster.", "It turns out that unsurprisingly, it's actually a pretty good idea. So the home video industry at this point is now bigger than box office for, uh, for film and television.", "Um, or I guess mostly film at this point. It's enormous. And the rental segment, so there's both sales and rental, uh, of home video.", "The rental segment is completely dominated by blockbuster.", "There's Hollywood video and a few others, but like blockbuster is that the 800 pound gorilla? I want to quote the here because for, for entrepreneurs out there who are listening, the moral of this story is you never get to stop justifying your market size to investors.", "It's going to be in your a pitch deck. And the second paragraph of the , and when Netflix goes public, first paragraph describes what they do.", "The second paragraph is in 2001 domestic consumer spent more than $32 billion on in-home filmed entertainment, representing approximately 80% of filmed entertainment, blah, blah, blah.", "It goes on to talk about exactly what David just said, that the largest portion is rental. I was reading the and I just chuckling that like.", "Did the story at any stage is always the same. What do you do? Why could it be huge? Why is your Tam then, how are you differentiated?", "The more things tuned, the more they stay. The same. Quick aside, because I think there's an important point here.", "This whole business of movie rentals. Is it in the first iteration of Netflix is business, and the blockbuster business is enabled by a Supreme court ruling around copyright law of what's called the first sale doctrine.", "Um, and it basically says that once you buy a copy of any copyrighted work, whether that's a book or a movie or whatever, you can then do whatever you want with it.", "You can resell it, you can rent it out like it's yours. You have then cleared the copyright that was established well before any of these businesses, but.", "The important point in here is that like regulatory issues and and lobbying and getting regulatory issues favorable to your business are very, very important.", "I feel like Silicon Valley now knows that, but for a long time and forgot that, and like this whole industry is enabled by a Supreme court ruling.", "And, and fortunately in a very sort of bayzos way where he basically always credits the infrastructure that was laid before him that allowed the company to exist, the internet, um, ups, et cetera.", "Like, you know, this wouldn't have been possible if what they had to do was go and lobby and get laws changed at the outset.", "Uh, infrastructure had been been laid for them. Go vote. It's important. Hopefully you already voted in these elections.", "Yeah, I assumed they had to pay some form of royalty back to the content holder every time they rented it.", "I mean, then blockbuster, like before Netflix comes along and you're just fat and happy blockbuster.", "That's kind of an amazing business. I mean, you buy this little store, it's not that big of square footage.", "You pay 15 to $18 or whatever for a movie, and then you rent it out for what? Like three, $3 and you run it.", "50 times or something. It's awesome. It's the same businesses scooters today. You know, you buy a scooter for 300 bucks, you rent it for a couple bucks per ride, and you do thousands of rides, and that's a good business.", "Okay, so they're getting started. Randolph goes to a conference in Las Vegas, the software and video conference.", "He meets a guy named Mitch Lowe who's going to come back into the story later. Mitch owns a 10 store video rental chain, small rental chain in Marin County.", "Just North of San Francisco. Again, Bay area geography.", "This is about as far on the opposite end of the Bay area as you can get from Santa Cruz. Uh, we're talking like two and a half hour drive with no traffic.", "Mitt is entrepreneurial. He owns these video rental stores, but he's also working on, uh, a software tool, a CRM tool for video rental stores and Randolph's like, Oh man, you are like the industry expert.", "Like I need you to come in. And like. Join the team. He eventually persuade him to do so. I assume it then moves from Miranda Santa Cruz cause you cannot do that commute every day.", "But he joined as the video acquisition chief, so he's now going to be in charge of like inventory and stocking and like what, what DVDs Netflix is going to buy.", "And so to kind of just like StitchFix like that we saw there like. Getting that early industry DNA on the team like really has a big impact together.", "They, and they'd hired a couple people from pure, a couple of folks that they'd worked with in the marketing department there.", "They all set on the settle on Netflix as the name, and then Ben texted me the original logo.", "We're going to have to tweet this and link to it in the show notes. Let's just say you don't want enterprise marketing people designing your consumer product, a branding and logo.", "I think, I think show notes can be a full HTML. So we'll just try and embed this image in the show notes.", "It is awesome. And the best thing is it was used for some really awful, it was 97 to 2000 and you know, Netflix on their next rev kind of nailed it and is basically the same logo they use today, except with a little bit of a nice brand refresh.", "But like the, the first one is . It's got this little like swooshy thing and it's very late nineties.", "Yeah. So it's purple. It was bad. Um, okay. Netflix. So what do they do? This is, this is brilliant. And I think this was driven by, by Mitch Lowe.", "DVDs are just getting launched. Like they're like. Most people don't have it. Player machines don't exist out there.", "How do they do like get their initial customers do initial customer feedback.", "They, they borrow a page, future page from me. They go online into product discussion, forums of enthusiasts for like.", "Movie technology and like DVD product forums, and they just started talking about Netflix there and like, people love it.", "So like 600 bucks, like getting a DVD player was like, Ooh, I'm like over 1000 bucks at this point in 1990 $7 so like the people who are buying these things are super techie, super early adopters, like the perfect market to adopt Netflix and give you no feedback here.", "Isn't it six 40 by four 80 like it's like, yeah, I think that, I think it might even be less. Like, you know, there's, it's for so research here, we didn't even go back and watch DVDs.", "Like, I don't, I don't have a DVD drive anywhere. I don't know if you do like, no, I sold my old X-Box", "and I have no, actually, I have no means to play any disks.", "Yeah, me neither. Well, wait, stay tuned for part two. Um. So they officially launch the product in April, 1998, November.", "They'd been building all this momentum and, uh, you know, early customer lists from these product forums.", "And it's just like they nail it. Like the market is still tiny, but like talk about product market fit on day one, the servers crashed.", "There's tons of demand. You could buy DVDs from them, right? Yes. You could both buy and rent. Yeah. Yeah.", "I mean, the magic that they came up with was the business model of rather than paying per DVD, you just pay a certain amount and then you can either keep two or three depending on what plan you opt into.", "But I didn't realize when they started, you could also just order DVDs from them and pay for them and keep them totally, uh, well, that part of the business is gonna come up again in one sec.", "The other perfect part of the timing here is like. The consumer electronics manufacturers were so powerful.", "This time we're talking Sony, Toshiba, Panasonic, like all these Japanese and some U S I forget which ones are us companies anyway, like these guys are dominant there.", "So, and they know that DVD. Machine's like that's their next drug that they're going to sell us consumers.", "Um, so they're pushing it hard, best buys, pushing it hard. Circuit city's pushing it hard. Netflix goes, and they do deals with these consumer electronics manufacturers to get Netflix promo coupons inserted into the boxes with DVD players, like talk about an awesome distribution act.", "Like it doesn't get any better than that. Uh, and this was a big part of their customer acquisition for many, many years, and it works like amazingly.", "The only downside is they're giving away a free month of Netflix, uh, as the promotion that ends up coming back to bite them in terms of that cost them a lot of money.", "Um, which we'll see in a sec. Blockbuster. While all this is going on, they're initially like, Oh, DVDs.", "That's like, nobody's going to use that. Like, you know, we're just going to stick with VHS. It feels shortsighted to me.", "In a different way than we normally rip on big companies that get disrupted. Like if you were to tell blockbuster at that time, streaming video on the internet will be the thing that ends you.", "Like it's not that surprising for me that they would scoff at that and like it just didn't feel like, it just felt like that was too far away.", "And when people actually do that and, but like just switching the size of the box. And like switching to a thing that plays videos better and like, come on, all electronics come down over time.", "How, how could they not believe that this was going to be a big change for their business? Well, okay,", "so let's be really fair to blockbuster here. So I went into research here thinking blockbuster. Oh my God, these guys are idiots.", "Like this is like. You know, classic case of corporate hubris getting disrupted, not the case at all.", "Blockbuster management until the very end is we'll see you is actually super competent and like really good.", "And the reason here that they didn't go into the market as fast as Netflix is, there was a format war, so DVD and Devex or battling it out against one another", "and it wasn't clear in the beginning who was going to win.", "Whoa. I forgot about Devex. Yeah. Devex um. That's like way lesser known that even like beta max or HD DVD or any of these alternatives, it was the beta max of of the, the optical disc era.", "So blockbuster was kind of waiting on the sidelines to see what would happen before they made the big bet and threw their weight behind it.", "Netflix bet the company on DVD over Devex. I don't know why. Maybe they just feel like, Oh, DVD, we'll go with that.", "Um, but fortunately it worked. Um, so that's ended up becoming like a digital, like a, not stream, but like fuck, it was like a files, like a filing coder format.", "And I used to have like a div IX player on my Mac that I could like play Devex files if I was downloading them from, uh, the back of a truck somewhere.", "And. Oh, the early two thousands so blockbuster isn't in the DVD game yet. Netflix is the only game in town.", "They've got promos in all the boxes with the players that are, that are shipping. The first four months after launch, they do 20,000 rentals.", "They're already at $1 million revenue run rate. Like that's super impressive.", "Even today, like start up, you launch here at $1 million revenue run rate. Four months in like super impressive and super capital efficient considering they were buying all these DVDs, like, I can't remember what did they, they had only raised the money from Reed to date, right?", "Well, capital official. Yeah. Yes, yes, yes. But with all this growth, like they are just burning huge.", "Like, like they're, they're, they're really in a rock and a hard place because they have to buy the DVDs.", "That's capital efficient. But the operations, this is why giving away those free rentals. The free month of rentals, which is going to end up being a couple, like they have to package these things in mailers, they have to ship them, they have to do all the labor to do that.", "They have to do the customer support. It gets really expensive to operate this, and the more you grow, the more expensive it gets.", "They realize that the. The Netflix actually had this perverse aspect of their business model and the DVD streaming era that their very best customers who use them the most cost them the most money.", "So they, uh, realized pretty early on before the streaming era, just before this in the DVD era. Because if you're constantly rotating disks in and out.", "You're costing Netflix a lot of money in operations to do that. So they, they figured out that they need to funnel customers to really obscure niches of like back catalog titles because those don't turn over as much.", "Like I might really love some like random thing. It's unlikely somebody else does. So I'm going to. Rent that keep it for a long time, and then I don't have other demand for that, uh, that unit.", "So that's how they start working on the recommendation algorithm and the personalization. As a result, it's not big new releases that drive Netflix in the early days.", "It's the back catalog. So Bollywood movies become huge. And this is funny. Um, softcore pornography becomes huge, as with all video formats, uh, the, uh, aphorism that pornography drives innovation, um, also true here.", "That's going to come back in a sec. So they raised the series a, there is a $6 million series a from IVP in August, 1998 to finance all of this.", "Reed is still finishing up at Stanford. He's just the investor, the angel investor. He's just on the board.", "He's not super involved. Uh, once he finishes his masters, he gets into, you know, education philanthropy as he wanted to.", "He also starts this thing called tech net. Um, which is a lobbying group for the technology industry.", "It's still the largest. Tech industry lobbying group. I didn't realize Reed Hastings started it like pretty cool.", "Um, so he starts that he's running that January, 1999 a couple things happen. One, there's some, uh, Reed is very liberal in his politics and other people in tech, at least at that point in time and still weren't, and they were like, you're running this lobbying group.", "You're very liberal. Like, I'm conservative. Like this should be more bipartisan. So. Reed ends up leaving tech net.", "He wants to get back into the entrepreneurial game. He's like, Oh, Netflix, my angel investment is kind of working.", "I'm going to go spend some more time there. He basically just shows up and announces like, okay, now I'm going to be co-CEO with Rand off here, and, uh, uh, ran off as apparently not super happy about this.", "But like, you know, the company's growing so. Okay. And read is great. So like everybody kind of gets along and they initially divvied up that Randolph's going to be in charge of marketing and content acquisition, and Reed is going to be in charge of engineering and ops.", "This is where Reed really starts building like a world-class technical team, technical and ops team at Netflix.", "I think this is the time when they actually name their algorithm, the cinema match, and they start having a company wide metric around, uh, .", "What percentage of the long tail of the DVDs are we actually successfully managing to get people to use their use one of their slots on?", "Yep. Yep. Obviously it will get into the Netflix, the challenge way later, but, um, this is really when it starts to become really in a lot of ways, pioneering modern data science and data engineering.", "Yup. And remember, they're still in Santa Cruz in Scott's Valley at this point. So reaches up and he's like, okay, a few things need to change around here.", "So one, even though they just raise this series a and they're still burning cash so fast because they're growing so quickly, they realize they need to fundraise again really quickly or like do something or they're going to go bankrupt.", "So the first thing that the board and Reed and Mark think is like. Oh, we said maybe we should just sell the company, like do a quick flip here.", "They, and who would be the natural acquire? None other than the inspiration for the company. Jeff Bezos.", "So the two of them fly up to Seattle, they meet with Bezos.", "This is a, this is 1998 still, I believe Bezos is like, Oh, you know, this is interesting. Okay. And Amazon is public.", "They've made some acquisitions at this point. Um, baseless is like, I'll give you $12 million to buy the company.", "Uh, which I assume must have been right around the post money for, uh, or maybe even less than the post.", "Of the raise that they just did. And Netflix is like, come on, like, no, we're not going to sell the company, but how about we do a cross promotion deal with you guys, where we've got this business where we're selling DVDs.", "Um, we're realizing that that's not super core to, to our subscription model. Um, how about we.", "Give you that. So whenever anybody on any Netflix customers want to buy DVDs, we'll just kick them over to Amazon to buy DVDs.", "Um, and an exchange. I think this happened to me once. Oh, really? I'm now like recalling it was in that era of Amazon doing these weird partnerships, like when as toys org us and target.", "Yeah. Yeah. Oh man. It's crazy. Imagining Amazon today doing some gigantic co-branded corner of their, their store like that.", "Seriously. Well, especially given what we'll see in part two with Amazon and video. So in return, Amazon is going to advertise Netflix on the homepage.", "Remember, this is the era of portals, which is now the most valuable real estate in technology.", "Crazy. So that happens on the back of that, they start fundraising and as they go out to fundraise, Reed is like, okay, like I'm the successful past entrepreneur here.", "I'm going to take over as the only CEO. I'm going to do this fundraise face of the company. I investors at this point need to bet that I'm going to do it again.", "Yep. He also, he's like. And we got to move out of Santa Cruz. We're going to move to Silicon Valley.", "So they compromise, they move to Silicon Valley technically, but they moved to Los Gatos, which is like as far South as you can possibly get in Silicon Valley.", "So probably another. 30 plus minutes South of Palo Alto and mountain view, I would say.", "And Netflix is still there today, and lots of people, especially as the company's grown now, live in San Francisco and work in Los Gatos and spend two hours a day on one-on-one commuting.", "Incredible is a good time. So it's a pretty special company to work for. When you think about why do people do this two hour commute?", "I'm actually not sure when this. Notorious deck, uh, started in his first revision. But the Netflix culture is extremely unique in the early days.", "And I don't know if the early days was right around this time or even earlier, Hastings decided that he needed to be able to communicate to new hires all the ways that they were very different and very opinionated in a culture.", "And he wanted to preserve this in a way that would scale because it didn't at his last company. To illustrate the point, there's two interesting things that all mentioned from Netflix's culture.", "One of which is that, uh, Hastings doesn't. Ever refer to it as a family. It's not welcome to the family.", "The more appropriate analogy is a sports team that we don't have unconditional love for each other.", "We have conditional love, we have really high standards, and it's a really high performing team. And to the degree that in a family, you can sort of love someone even if they're not a, a, an amazing employee on a team you don't.", "The second tidbit is that out of respect for everyone else on the team, they hold every seat to a really high regard.", "And so. You, you will be let go from the company if you are not performing really well. And it's not because they're punishing you for that or anything.", "It's out of respect to everyone else who is still at the company because they deserve to work with an a player and they say they take the burden on this and say, we were extremely generous with severance, but, uh, we're extremely opinionated that, you know, you need to be an extremely high performer to have that seat, otherwise you need to make it available for someone else.", "Out of fairness, I've always thought like. The way that all this is sort of like phrase, and they came up with this as so both opinionated and thoughtful and every little detail considered.", "Now a Hastings has released the deck on SlideShare, and I think it might be like the number one view, uh, deck on SlideShare meeting years ago.", "It was released on SlideShare and it's still a way, yeah. Yeah. And so like it was this internal thing that they evolved over and over and over, and then finally decided we should make this available for public consumption because it's a great recruiting tool.", "I mean, for the right set of people, like that's why you're off to a flame.", "Yeah, yeah. Yeah. So one of the things that makes them different, you see. Reads personal history and shaping reflected in this culture, like as all companies, right?", "Or like, like my partner Riley at wave is, uh, he always says like, company cultures are like, reflections of pure reflections of the founder, you know, personalities.", "And, uh, you know, read as a guy who was. And ROTC was going to join the Marines and then instead did the peace Corps and then, you know, went to Silicon Valley and became an engineer and then a CEO, and then a philanthropist.", "Like it's just all like these, this dichotomy, like baked in there. Very cool. In addition to all of those things, he is also a fundraising machine.", "Remember, he has orchestrated the largest merger in Silicon Valley history at this point. So basically every VC, and this is before the the.com crash, they're like.", "Oh, Reed Hastings, you're raising like, how much money can I give you? Um, he raises his, within a few months, raises $100 million or, or rephrased, uh, from our last, uh, LP bonus show.", "How large of a percentage ownership can I have in your company? Yes, exactly. And I don't care what the tech size is, right?", "You raises. Oh, $100 million, mostly from TCV. Uh, and we'll see. TCV ends up being a enormous shareholder in Netflix, um, and IPO and several other firms.", "David: One of the first hires he makes after becoming full CEO of the company is Acquired superhero -- who has shown up in at least one other episode, probably many more...", "David: Barry McCarthy, who he hires a CFO of Netflix. And Barry becomes critical to Netflix's success, then does his short detour at Clinkle before going to Spotify.", "Ben: Yeah, fast forward through that. Or DVD skip through that.", "Ben: So Barry's fame for folks who have listened to the Spotify episode is that he's the guy conceived of and then executed the plan for the direct listing, where Spotify did not actually issue new shares at IPO.", "David: Huge, huge hire as well as several other folks. They hired Tom Dylan from Seagate to run ops for the company.", "Remember, ops is super important here and then together this lead new leadership team, like they all kind of figured out like a sort of similar to Amazon and prime that delivery speed for rentals, movie rentals, when DVD rentals, when you order them is huge and that the faster they can get.", "From you clicking a rental online on Netflix to getting the DVD in your mailbox. That drives customer loyalty.", "That drives retention, but most importantly, that drives word of mouth and organic distribution. Like when you click rent magical, you get, remember this is 1998 99 you get that DVD in your mailbox.", "The next day you're going to tell all your friends. It's funny like how archaic it feels now, because now I'm like, how could it not be, you know, actually instant.", "But I am remembering, I'm trying to think what year it was. Probably 2000 it was the summer of 2008 cause I was doing my internship in, in North Carolina for Cisco and my roommates and I did a Netflix plan for our apartment.", "Uh, cause none of us were 21 yet. And so we were like, what do we do every day after work? And so we just got a really fat Netflix plan.", "And like. It was pretty amazing that like you, we'd hear about a movie from a friend over the weekend.", "We'd like click the button and then we were watching it Tuesday night and sometimes even Monday night.", "And it's, it's like, it's, it's funny to describe that as a magical experience, but it totally was. And this is all thanks to Dylan and McCarthy and, and, and read and then the rest of company of the company, of course.", "But they figured this out and they realized that this is the key. One of the key levers to their business.", "So they start building distribution centers, not just like randomly like, Oh, we're going to build them in big cities and geographical density.", "They start late. They get really analytical about it, like where's our customer base? Where's it growing?", "Where our word of mouth hotspots, let's build distribution centers close to them and get these DVDs to them as fast as possible and grow demand kind of organically.", "This way also helps them better manage inventory. Uh, everything. And then of course, this leads to the recommendation algorithm becoming super, super important.", "Did you ever manage your Netflix queue? I, I'm like remembering old features now that were like critically important to the service.", "Did you, were you, were you a subscriber back then?", "No, I subscribed way late. I'm not, I don't want a ton of movies, so, uh, it was, I was not the target market.", "I remember being obsessed and actually comparing my cue with friends. It was two things that were important to like compare with friends.", "One was like all my ratings, I'm like a completionist when Twitter was not algorithmic, I tried to read every tweet and I think I did between like 2009 and like 2017 and so like I tried to like.", "Ray, every movie I'd ever seen and find it on Netflix and rate it. And like the, I had a group of friends that totally prided themselves on doing that and being very opinionated about each of these movies.", "And the other thing that I definitely remember is I built up this huge queue that I was constantly adjusting of, like, which movies were going to be sent to me when and like how much did I want to prioritize moving something through the queue?", "And I thought, I mean both of those systems were just genius cause they were. I know Netflix wasn't measuring engagement, but engagement ended up being a proxy for how long am I going to stay a customer?", "And like both of those things like lit up my brain and all the right ways of, Oh, I have to go and update this piece of data on Netflix and lay the groundwork for.", "Netflix today and the streaming one real quick, funny aside, I mentioned pornography being a big part of Netflix in the early days read, uh, in 2000, he gets appointed to the California board of education.", "Uh, he's like, um, we need to get out of this pornography thing. So, uh, let's just, let's just, uh, that, that never happened.", "So another thing you will never find in Netflix history, but did drive a bunch of their growth in the early days.", "Okay. It's 2000. Growth is great. Everybody's high flying. High fiving, they got an a team, you know, built at the company.", "They file to go public and McCarthy is going to take them public. They have 120,000 subscribers.", "They're shipping 800,000 DVDs a month. Everything is great. But then the.com crash happens before, uh, before they can actually get out and get public.", "They postpone the IPO, but again, they're still growing and again, as they grow, they're burning all this capital so much so that they've burned through the a hundred million dollars that they've raised.", "Fortunately. The existing investors were so excited before the IPO, they wanted to buy in and get more of the company and get a pop.", "They invest another about $50 million before the IPO and before the crash. It turns out to be super necessary capital, but the crash happens and like, they're like, I don't think we can survive.", "Once again, they try and offload the company and sell it this time, not to Amazon. They go to. Blockbuster, blockbuster, and this is where blockbuster enters the story.", "So they go to Dallas where Blockbuster's headquartered Dallas, Texas. They meet with them and they'll like, you know, we need to sell the company.", "We want to sell it for 50 million, 50 this company's raised like 150 million at this point. Like, imagine if this transaction had happened.", "Blockbuster's like, eh, you seem kind of desperate. I don't think so. We're just going to crush you. Unreal.", "Absolutely unreal. Totally unreal. So for the companies that made it through the.com burst, you look at Amazon, you look at Netflix, you're like, wow, they were really smart, really good capital allocators.", "We're super nimble. We're able to make it through this. Like Netflix tried to get out. They were like, look, we'll just cut our losses and go be part of blockbuster.", "And again, blockbuster on not idiots. They're, they're really not. Like they. At this point, C DVDs, um, are already in the market.", "And they also see the online subscription business model and how good it is.", "They are like, this is why they don't buy them. They're like, we could spend $15 million on buying you or we could spend slightly less than that and just copy you and build you and use the blockbuster brand.", "And they build blockbuster online and which is a clone of Netflix. And it's really good. Like, you know, initially it's not so good and Netflix kind of makes fun of them, but like eventually, like it gets really good.", "The website was terrible. There's actually a really good a recommend, a friend of the show, a Caro over at Wondery.", "They did an episode, um, or a little series called business Wars was about Netflix versus blockbuster.", "And there's some Epic episodes in there about Hastings and the rest of the Netflix team.", "Sort of like loading up the blockbuster site when it first launches and laughing at how terrible the website is, and they can't even, like, they got Accenture to build it.", "They didn't hire their own engineers. And like. But they overcome it. They, they actually make it get, um, I mean, we'll think about this.", "It's Netflix, but if you actually want a video tonight, you can just go return it to blockbuster and then get a new one rather than waiting for this whole mail thing.", "Well, well that comes up in one sec. So initially, blockbuster online is a true Netflix clone. It's separate, separate business, separate office building from blockbuster.", "No attachment to the stories because they franchise the stores. So the franchisee owner of the store is, they don't want blockbuster online to be cannibalizing.", "Their business. So that kind of becomes an issue in a bit. Netflix though, they're like, all right, we can offload this thing.", "Well, I guess we're going to have to soldier through, so they do.", "This is what we're going to say these things, but like I want everybody to like really think about this.", "They do a 40% layoff, a 40% riff of the company. Four out of 10 people they lay off. Remember it just a couple months ago they were going to go public and everyone was high fiving.", "Having lived through my first two years in the working world of the 2008 recession.", "Like, I know what this feels like. Like bad times are bad. Like we have been in good times for the last, you know, 10 years.", "Imagine that like 40% of your coworkers just gone in one day and Netflix does this, but this is what they have to do.", "And the way that they did it too, he called a immediate urgent company meeting.", "They made this decision. He calls it an immediate company meeting and says. 40% of you are going to be laid off today.", "And then people go back to their offices to wait and see if their manager comes to talk to them or not.", "Harrowing, totally harrowing, but managed about as well as he can. And, um. You know, it's just like in times like this, it's either the company is going to die because you're going to go bankrupt, or you need to cut the burn.", "This is war time. You know? And this was also is interesting reading that Netflixed book. The way that Barry McCarthy sort of was looking at this as we need to do this.", "To prepare for the IPO, not only from a cash burn perspective, like we've got, I think they ended up IPOing with $15 million in the bank.", "Um, so they definitely needed that, that mezzanine round that they thought was just going to be to, uh, let those investors buy a little extra equity.", "But. It was really about a, what story were they gonna go tell the street when they, when they went into BPO in 2002", "yeah. And I think they weren't quite profitable when the IPO, but it was, they were on track to be profitable the next year.", "And you know, they needed to show that even if they were a very lean organization and they needed to be, to be in this.com burst era, that they could still execute their business.", "And also when it comes to this, I mean, like. So it's kudos to, again, a terrible moment, but like so many other companies would have been like, let's cut 10% then let's cut another 10% and like thousand cut your way into it.", "McCarthy and Hastings. They're like, no, we're cutting to the bone. We're doing it right now. This is one example.", "There's another example we'll get to in this episode, and then there's a third example that we're going to save for the second part of this, this Netflix set, but Reed Hastings and Netflix management are.", "Awesome at executing these. Like we made a decision, we're going to go hard at it. I know it seems insane, but we have very sound logic for why it needs to happen and it's happening.", "I'll foreshadow that the next two are related to, uh, either spin offs or spin outs from that. Indeed.", "Well, okay. Uh. The next year, it May, 2002 they finally do the IPO.", "This is still a nuclear winter for the tech world. Um, but they need the cash. They've gotten to profitability.", "They're like, we're just going to do it. We're going to go public. They raise 82 and a half million dollars in their IPO and a market cap of just over $300 million.", "So they sell over a quarter of the company in the IPO.", "Oh, I mean, like, can you imagine that these days it's like seven to 10%? Like, you know, like, Oh, well, and it's not, it's another not IPOing for $300 million.", "I know. I know. Crazy. Yeah. I joke to David and I message last night, like, wow, it's a really nice, a nice series B post IPO story.", "Seriously. Um. But the business is capitalized, and then, you know, they have no debt.", "They don't need to raise any more money, and they don't, uh, they eventually do take on debt, but I believe not until the streaming era.", "I think they did a tiny secondary the next month and just sold a little bit more in sort of a additional stock offering.", "But yeah, T to your point, no, nothing meaningful for awhile.", "Yeah, they're fully capitalized. So remember Randolph, the original CEO and a, and lo, the guy who was running the, the video stores in Marin.", "Now that the IPO has happened, they're like, okay, great. We're going to go focus on new things like initiatives within the company now, and they start testing kiosks, Netflix kiosks that they're going to put in grocery stores, and they're like, this is going to be a great new growth initiative, and Hastings and McCarthy, they're like.", "Yes. And actually Hastings at first agrees about the problem they're trying to solve. So an important detail is that Netflix is convenient in a way, because you don't have to leave your house, but it's inconvenient in a way that you can't have it now.", "Like they constantly were struggling with this existential problem of instant is not a part of our value proposition to date.", "And so, you know, this is sort of a. Um, lo and Randolph's brilliant idea of like, maybe, maybe this is the way to solve instead.", "Maybe this is the way to solve instance. Maybe it is, but eventually McCarthy and everybody, they're just like, guys, we just did a 40% riff.", "There are no new initiatives that we're doing right now. They kill and. And we'll wait before they kill it though.", "This is great. Uh, low and Randolph are so obsessed with this idea, the two of them. So they've convinced a grocery store, a single grocery store in Las Vegas at Smith's grocery chain to work with them to do this.", "And. This is so awesomely startup-y they decide it's not worth our investment in figuring out how to actually build a vending machine that's going to event DVDs.", "So we're going to task a Netflix employee to just stand there behind a little like kiosk. It's a store within a store after the checkout of the Smith's grocery store, and just like people can come and they will just do it manually and the employee will hand you the DVD, which is just awesome.", "And to oversee this. I know lo and Randolph actually got, uh, an apartment and move there for a month to kind of like be a part of standing up this operation.", "I mean, they were still awesome. It is awesome. Uh, as we will see. Um, but you can also understand why McCarthy in Hastings, like guys, guys, not now.", "The second thing that happened before they killed it is that, um. Lowe went and talked to the CEO of McDonald's and was basically like brokering a deal.", "It was like, then he came back to this guy freaking loved it. McDonald's was like, we want to roll this out at all of our, you know, a little extra revenue for the people that are hanging out in our stores.", "We're in and so low brings this back to Hastings and Hastings is like, are you freaking kidding me? Like our first brand impression with the majority of American that doesn't use us yet is not going to be in makeup.", "Donald's when they're waiting in lion like that. No, absolutely not. And so part of killing it was like, look, we don't have the head count for this.", "We don't, we can't split our focus like this. And now you're coming to me with McDonald's. All right, David, take the curtain off.", "What did this become and how did it become that? So Randolph and lo, they're demoralized. Netflix has changed so much.", "Randolph, you know, he started this thing, he was CEO, like, you know, it's, it's time for us to go.", "They go, Randolph gets full time into an investing, and as we talked about and liquor and all that low, he can't stop thinking about this kiosk thing.", "He's like, I'm gonna make this happen. He's like, I'm going to start a company. That company becomes red box, which child while she's out.", "An actual, very significant competitor to a Netflix.", "Yeah. I actually don't know what's happened to it now. Like, does it still exist in the streaming world?", "I think it is now part of something called outer wall, uh, which is, uh, they own, uh. Redbox, Coinstar, eco ATM, gazelle, a bunch of these other things.", "Outer wall stands for the outer wall of the grocery store and it was basically rolled up.", "I think it's actually a Bellevue based company. Yeah. Yeah. Cause Coinstar was in Bellevue. Yeah. Yeah.", "I think maybe Coinstar expanded to become outer wall when it rolled up. All this other stuff, something like that.", "But red box is now part of that, uh, that private equity family. Yeah. Crazy. Crazy. Um. Okay. So back to Netflix.", "We're now in March, 2003. Things are going great. The company hits a million subscribers. They announced this on their earnings call.", "Everyone's high-fiving once again, as we'll see, this doesn't last long. McCarthy. He's like, this is great.", "I've gotten landed the plane. I really want to go be the CEO of my own company.", "I'm going to leave by the end of the year and do that. But you know, I want to give everybody plenty of notice.", "Want to give the street notice. Um, so he announces that. Almost immediately afterwards. Blockbuster fully launches, they've been testing, they fully launched blockbuster online the week that they launch blockbuster online to the general public Netflix market.", "Cap drops is 60% in one week like a rock. And as we said, like it actually becomes a pretty good product.", "Plus they have all the marketing power of blockbuster. And so what happens is very quickly. All of the market going to subscription based online movie rentals, DVD rentals.", "Every new customer in America who came to do this. I had to do Netflix. Blockbuster gets 50% of new signups.", "So have new people coming into the market, which is where the vast majority of the market is still coming in.", "Blockbuster takes 50% share immediately. And if you think about that, the timing on this, so when, when Netflix IPO, they had 500,000 subscribers.", "It's an interestingly, not that big of a number on the number of movies. It was 11,500 movies, as they say in their .", "So. It's now 2003 Netflix is barely profitable. They just turned their first quarter profit. Blockbuster launches this.", "This is exactly at the the crest of the DVD wave where when Netflix is reporting earnings, sort of the quarters before blockbuster, they're like celebrating on the earnings call.", "Like. There is now $200 DVD players. America is buying DVD players. Our bet was right. This is just fueling our business.", "This is amazing timing. And so for blockbuster, judge, just nail it and launch it exactly. This time is like this.", "This a million subscribers that they have up from 500,000 at IPO is. You know, there's a, what, 200 million households in the U S or something like that.", "Like anything that happened before is irrelevant and what matters now as new signups in the future. Yep.", "Exactly. Not only does that happen, they've got a second problem, which they're even more worried about.", "They get word that Amazon. And they're one time potentially acquire is going to come into the market and is working on building a Netflix competitor.", "Remember, not streaming. We're still in the DVD rental market. They announced this. They're like, we gotta be honest about this with the street.", "They announced this on their Q3 analyst call that they think Amazon is coming. They're going to get ready for it, and McCarthy says, I'm not leaving.", "I'm going to stick it out in a fight here. He actually says, and I quote on the. On the investor analyst call, you don't leave your friends in the middle of a knife fight.", "It was just awesome. What a hero. Uh, and uh, uh, and he literally like swashbuckling comes rides back in.", "In an anticipation, none of of blockbuster, not in reaction to blockbuster, but in an anticipation of Amazon coming in.", "Cause I think Amazon's gonna follow the Amazon playbook and just undercut everybody on price. Netflix cuts their subscription price by almost 20% for the first time.", "It's like sub $20 for the, the big plan. Yup. Unfortunately, this turns into a full on disaster. A Amazon actually never ends up entering the market they do in Europe.", "Um, but not in the U S blockbuster sees this and they're like, Oh, Netflix is starting a price war. So now blockbuster and Netflix get locked into a price war and blockbuster further undercuts Netflix.", "And things go like haywire. Cause remember the cash burn cycle is super important here in blockbuster has a much healthier balance sheet at this point too.", "So blockbuster is like, wait, Netflix just cut prices. Why? Like we can outspend them. Okay. I guess we'll cut prices.", "Yep. Well they can in the Gantt as we'll see, so McCarthy and hasty, they'll like. Okay. We need to model out exactly.", "Because Netflix has a bunch, blockbuster has a bunch of debt from their old stores, and they used to be part of Viacom", "There was a whole complicated transaction. So yes, they have resources, but they also have debt covenants, so they model out in detail.", "What they think the blockbuster online business is, how long they think they can survive at this lower price, and with all the promotions they're doing until they trigger their debt covenants.", "And so they'll like, okay, we think we have about six months. David, can you go into what, what debt covenants are a little bit.", "Definitely. If you have debt, there are agreements on the debt called covenants that basically say you have to maintain certain financial, uh, health metrics of financial health.", "If you don't, if you trigger those debt covenants, then you.", "The lenders, the people who own your debt can put you into default and push you into bankruptcy. So it's like you don't want to do that.", "Now. You can go back and renegotiate with them anyway, lots of detail and all this happens with blockbuster.", "And just to drive the point home and put a super fine point on the, um.", "On the cash cycle here? Yes, there's been a million subscribers acquired. They hope to acquire another hundred million in the future.", "They're dramatically accelerating marketing spend to be able to bring people on at a faster rate every quarter than they had been before.", "However, since the first month is free, they make no money on people for at least a month after they acquire them and they're spending more money than ever before.", "To get nothing for that first month. So it's like, you know, to your point, that timing is tricky. Plus there's advertising dollars that you're spending to get those new customers.", "So what does blockbuster do? They run a Superbowl ad indefinitely. Like, Oh my God. Um, but they keep cool heads.", "We're still getting subscribers. If anything, blockbuster is just educating the market. They don't cut prices further.", "They don't get further drawn into the price war and it basically works because we will see here the, if Barry McCarthy is the acquired superhero, the acquired super villain.", "Carl Aiken of Marvel fame of a warehouses he showed up in our episodes so far, I don't think we've talked about Matthew is with Apple with wa like this guy.", "Oh my God. Hedge fund billionaire hold activist shareholder. He gets super involved with blockbuster.", "He buys about a 17, either 17 or 19% stake on the public markets in blockbuster starts agitating fire files.", "A proxy battle to basically at the blockbuster annual shareholder meeting to, uh, elect a separate slate of board directors that are all his cronies.", "He wins crazy. Again, blockbuster is actually like. Being smart here. Their management is actually pretty good.", "Carl, I can just like replaces the whole board with like I can cronies.", "He starts bringing his son to board meetings. Who's disliked. Some 26 year old dude, and he's like, you should give product Zane.", "It's insane. But for the black Western management, they managed to kind of like keep things on track and they decided with all this going on, they need to raise prices back up.", "Um, so Netflix and blockbuster both raise prices back up. The tide is rising. Both companies are coexisting here in the market.", "Things go pretty well. Netflix is still the leader. They end 2005 now they have over 4 million subscribers.", "They have a market cap of over a billion and a half. So up. What's that?", "Five X from the IPO. Three years ago they launched the Netflix prize in 2006 that you alluded to, which is we probably don't have time to cover it in it.", "Full detail here, maybe in the, maybe in part two, but super awesome. Get a ton of PR. Can any brilliant computer scientists out there beat our algorithm by, was it 10% 10% yup.", "Yup. Yeah. Everybody thinks that like it's going to happen very quickly. Ends up taking like three years before it finally does get a, it's 2009 I think when the, when the prize was finally awarded.", "But anyway. All this is happening. Blockbuster. Like they're still growing, but they realize like the bricks and mortar business is, is, you know, not long for this world online.", "And we're now in the mid two thousands, um, they really need to go all in. Management decides on online", "and they think, what is, what is the one thing we have. That we can beat Netflix on. They've realized that the turnaround time on rentals is super important, and this is actually pretty brilliant.", "They come up with this concept called that the market is total access, which is essentially you sign up for, yeah, this is a debit at the end.", "You sign up for blockbuster online, which is essentially just a Netflix clone and the, the extra that you get is.", "You can now return your movies to any blockbuster store and exchange them for your next movies at the store.", "So this is like what Amazon is doing with, um, you know, Amazon go and prime now, and like, this is actually like pretty visionary.", "It's risky because it does involve a lot of capital. A lot of ops. Um, you know, it's, it's like people are very skeptical that this could work, but if it does, Netflix can't match it.", "They have no physical footprint. Um, and blockbuster has stores all across America. Netflix is super, super scared when this happens.", "This is in 2006. So scared that at Sundance in the beginning of 2007, um, well, and they get scared, it actually makes a huge impact.", "So Epic's growth flatlines not only do they stop growing, they start losing subscribers. Uh, this has never happened.", "Like, remember, they've just been. Adding subscribers, you know, quarter after quarter, after quarter.", "It's like watching Snapchat or something. Totally. This is like, this is the Instagram stories moment.", "Um, and they're so worried. Sundance 2007, Reed Hastings meets with the blockbuster CEO and he offers essentially a merger of the two companies.", "And he says. Netflix will buy Blockbuster's online business from you for $600 million.", "So it'll be essentially like a, I guess what's that like two thirds Netflix, one-third blockbuster is the ratio.", "I assume it would be all stock and blockbuster rejects it. They were like, no, man, we got you guys on the roofs.", "We have a structural advantage you don't have. We're back in the game. And then history like turns on a knife point.", "This is crazy. Like blockbuster was gonna win. If they could execute this. But Carl Icahn, Oh my God.", "Oh my God. This is literally, this might be the worst self inflicted wound in like the history of business.", "This makes like the Uber thing look like child's play. Carl lichen and the blockbuster CEO get in right around this time, get into a huge fight over the CEO's annual bonus and such a fight that the CEO resigns and, and I can put him out.", "I can then hires a new CEO. This dude from seven 11 who this guy, and to be clear, this is icon scrutinizing the CEO's proposal for his and other executives bonuses and saying, Nope, I don't see why you should be paying yourself that much.", "Yep, exactly. And the blockbuster CEO is like, I'm like successfully navigating this.", "I'm about to beat Netflix. They just capitulated. They just offered a merger and I think I'm going to beat them.", "And uh, the, this guy who car-like and brings in, I don't even remember his name, it's not worth it. Basically, like, we try to be pretty even imbalanced on acquired.", "This guy is a total idiot. Like he is a complete moron.", "This is, this is like, he doesn't, he's, he says he doesn't believe in online businesses. This is 2007 like, it's pretty clear that online businesses are a thing.", "Google has been public for three years. Like, you know, this is insanity. He doesn't believe in online businesses.", "He, his plan. He's going to totally defund the blockbuster online.", "He thinks Netflix is a joke. Nobody's going to do it. Uh, he wants to bring back the heyday of bricks and mortar, wants to make bricks and mortar great again.", "He wants to attract a cold. David. He wants to attract the kids to come to blockbuster stores by selling pizza and soda at the stores.", "He calls it rock the block. God. It's like this is like a gift from heaven. If your jaw drop and be like, Whoa, we're saved.", "Here's the kicker. Here's the kicker. I remember this. I was working on wall street when this happened.", "Circuit city is like on the brink of bankruptcy. Uh, best buy does manage to survive this, but they're also at the brink of bankruptcy.", "Amazon is eating everybody's lunch. Again, online businesses, they work this, see this new CEO of blockbuster.", "He's like. We're going to buy circuit city for $1 billion. You literally cannot make this stuff up and always better than than than one failing business.", "You put two of them together. We're going to tie two anchors together and drop them into the ocean.", "Oh my God. It's ridiculous. Everybody. It doesn't actually happen because even Carl lichen is like, I'm not sure that's a good idea.", "Um, have you, have you been to one recently? Yeah. So basically everybody good at blockbuster who was running the online business.", "They just resigned. And it's crazy. Like in the book, they talk about the guy who was running the online business.", "He's really good. After all this happens. Rebasing calls him up and he's like, Hey, let's like get dinner and they get dinner and they talk about everything", "and then he invites him out to Netflix. He does like a town hall at Netflix and they talk about the whole history and what blockbuster online was doing with Netflix was going, it's crazy.", "They all resigned. We know what happens. Blockbuster goes bankrupt. All of the. Momentum they had around total access.", "It just dies. They defund the whole thing. Netflix wins, and it's amazing because like all of this again, once again, Netflix was at the brink of death.", "A miracle happens. All of the marketing, all the buzz around total access for blockbuster, that just brings so many more people of the mainstream in America into this market.", "They all go to Netflix. So by spring of 2009 Netflix now has 10 million subscribers. They're thriving.", "Nobody's canceling during the recession. They're on the top of the world. It's amazing. And that is where we're going to leave part one because there's another thing on the horizon coming.", "I thought Netflix was such a like stable, boring business.", "So not the case. You can't stay on your laurels for long because streaming is coming. What a good place to leave it.", "When we were going back and forth last night on where should we leave it? Should we, uh, should we go into Quickster now I'm really glad that we, uh, uh, this feels like such a good place to, to hang.", "Uh, totally. I just like. Circuit city circuit city. I read again like the worst, the worst. Um, alright.", "I'm emotionally exhausted, but we have other sections. Should we do narratives? Yeah. Going into narratives.", "I want to recap just a couple of things from reading the, the last night cause I think they're interesting.", "Um, so they sold 27% of the company in this IPO, raised 82 point $5 million, no net income, yet I'll only net losses, but about to have their first quarter of net income.", "The cap table is fascinating. So Reed Hastings owns 20% of the company, uh, which will get diluted down to about 15% after the IPO TCV technology, crossover ventures in two different vehicles.", "I, I'm pretty sure I'm reading this right, has 46% of the company. Yeah. Crazy. Pretty rare to see that at IPO, a single firm with different era ownership.", "Totally different era. You look at what they did there, they were able to, uh, to raise, you know, I think in that with including that second little offering close to $100 million, they made no real promises in their about sort of what they were going to do with that in any substantial way.", "They sort of just talked about they were going to spend on marketing. They were going to spend on improving the technology.", "They were going to increase the, the selection that they had. I mean, it wasn't like when we talk about what did they do with this, this capital, they run a flywheel business, so they just had to pour more money into the flywheel and have more money to be able to accelerate it.", "You know, in, in looking back, we, we tend to do these, this narrative section where we do bulls and bears, unlike other times like Facebook or like the net, the snap IPO, it's not like there were people running these articles of, of doom and gloom.", "I mean, it was pretty. Hey, this thing seems to be going pretty well.", "It's pretty disruptive. It's not clear if it's going to work yet, but they're IPOing and it's not a huge IPO.", "Well, to jump into the bear case here, all that's true. And like, yeah, I mean, if you really looked at it like.", "This was a really good business. I mean, there was potential headwinds in the future of blockbuster.", "It was one of the only tech companies, uh, cause people just watched all these dot-coms go bust. It was one of the only tech companies that was posting, you know, nice financials and was about to be profitable.", "I mean, there was like this huge, wow, it's a real business. You should buy it. Yup. But I think the bear case is, is, yeah, people are just still, so, you know, human psychology hangover from the IPO crash, they're all like, huh, this CEO like was the largest merger and you know, Silicon Valley history and the bubble era now, like you guys are losing money.", "And like, I don't believe in online businesses, you know? And also to be fair, a fair bear case was, I dunno, don't count out blockbuster.", "And as we've seen blockbuster very well could won here. Um, you know, hard to know. But yeah, the bookcase, like you said, like this is a good business.", "Subscription businesses like they could be a thing if, if they work, if you can get them to work, they can be very challenging to scale.", "But like, this is why cable companies are so good and cable companies will come back up in part two of the episode.", "Like if you can get consumers locked into paying you a certain amount every month, like you can. Build a very stable, very predictable, very good cashflow business around that.", "What would have happened otherwise? Let's do it. I struggle to find any other way that this could have worked out for Netflix.", "I mean, they either would have ended up part of Amazon and I'm not sure they would have maintained the brand part of blockbuster", "and they would have killed it. That would have been a terrible, yeah.", "Um. If they hadn't opportunistically raised some cash right before they thought they were going to IPO, then they probably wouldn't have weathered the storm.", "If they didn't IPO when they did, then they probably wouldn't be able to, um, properly fight blockbuster.", "Yeah. Just a lot of things went their way here. Company is, it's skill and luck. Yeah, totally. Totally.", "I think maybe there is a world where they could have kept it. Delayed the IPO longer, you know, they were at profitability and that would have been the wrong decision, I think because blockbuster was coming into the market and access to capital in the private markets didn't exist like it exists today.", "Yup, totally. Yup. They had to do this. Yeah, tech themes. Let's do it. The first one that I'm thinking of is like, and we've beat this to death on this episode, so it's not gonna be like surprising to anyone, but tabula rasa.", "If you come up to me and said, what wave did Netflix take advantage of to, to really launch them as a company, I'd be like streaming, but like, the fact that DVDs were a wave is still a little bit mind blowing to me that I did.", "It's just very, uh. I think how fast as humans, we forget the very recent past and what was a big deal and what wasn't is striking.", "Totally. And yeah, just timing, like not only a big wave, but like Netflix timed it so perfectly. Um, and this is why we ended up breaking this episode into two.", "The DVD. Part of Netflix and foreshadowing Quickster they really are two different businesses. Did you know you can still go to DVD?", "Oh, actually they'd say they bought the domain. Netflix has dvd.com can go and access their DVD offering there.", "Huh. Interesting. Yeah. Wow. I wonder, I mean there still are people who, I think they still have a few million DVD subscribers to this day.", "Interestingly enough, from dvd.com this is how muddle this stuff gets. You can rent Blu-rays. What about depicts alpha delpo?", "Um, okay. I have a couple. The biggest one though, we, we glossed over a lot of stuff as we had to in this story.", "Um, this is part of why we're doing our LP program and bonuses is to get deeper into like, who are the people that like actually build these things?", "And one of the decisions along the way that, like operationally helped make all this happen. But one thing that.", "Again, we didn't get to cover as much in this episode. That I think is an interesting theme, both across Amazon and Netflix, is that the people in finance and marketing, and we did talk about McCarthy and at Netflix, at these first-generation internet companies were so good.", "Like Barry McCarthy, joy Covey at Amazon, uh, Leslie Kilgore, who ran marketing analytical marketing at Netflix.", "Like we didn't get to talk about her, but there are so many people that are just like really, really, really good.", "They tended to come from, um, like the CPG world, like from Proctor and gamble. And I think that's where Leslie Kilgore came from.", "I could be wrong on that, but there are a bunch of these folks at Amazon, a bunch of these folks in Netflix, um, and they're just so good.", "And I feel like that's like a. That's like a piece of DNA that's now missing in the Valley is like this combination of finance and marketing, you know, and there's like growth, quote unquote, which is sort of the successor to this.", "But, um, cowboy marketing. Yeah. It's become so cowboy and it's become also just so dependent on Google and Facebook.", "Like, although the good growth, people would find ways and tell you that their way isn't right. And Google and Facebook and there's, there are still ways, there are still good people, but you know, this is the.", "Barry McCarthy modeling out Netflix, his online business to a T like he knew what month they were going to have to raise prices.", "The Netflix program with consumer manufacturers, uh, of, of, uh, consumer electronics manufacturers to put the coupons in the boxes and modeling out exactly what was that was gonna cost exactly what their growth rate was going to be.", "You know, the going population, um, subscriber center by subscriber center with the, with the one day delivery being driven by.", "Where word of mouth is occurring, like all that stuff. Like that's the company building stuff that bill Netflix into like a great business and Amazon did the same thing.", "I have two trends that I want to call out that were stated in the because one of the things you commonly see in these S ones is.", "It's an area called trends, but it's basically why should you believe that the wind is at our backs? And one is one that I hadn't really thought about that much, which was the very first one they call out as the shift to viewing in home instead of in theaters.", "And I had forgotten about this because this was like in the era, I think it was a little bit before the era where.", "Piracy really accelerated people, not going to movie theaters. But there was already a trend where people were like, gosh, why?", "You know, I can go rent it at blockbuster. Why would I, you know, I'll, I'll, I'll wait to see it on video and it'll be cheap on video.", "And this was killing movie theaters. But this trend was starting to accelerate. And that was one thing that they cited that it was like, look, no matter how people are renting movies, like they're watching them at home, and that's really helpful for us, which I thought was interesting.", "And the other that they cited was in a slightly different words, but the paradox of choice, that it was really hard.", "So there was one of two things will happen. You go to blockbuster and you're mad that there's not enough selection, or the movie that you want is out.", "Okay. If you go anywhere where there's infinite selection, then it's, it's too hard to choose what movie that you want to watch.", "But they had Cinemax and the cinema algorithm was really good at telling you what movie you probably want to watch next.", "And so they actually cited that as a sort of trend and advantage to Netflix in their, their S one to shareholders, which was interesting.", "And I've got a few more, but we're going to save those for part two. All right. Should we grade this and we're going to grade the IPO here.", "Yeah. So I was thinking about this and I'm like, okay, let, let's say they didn't, cause we've already covered, like they, they needed the IPO to have the cash to be able to win the war that they won", "and they were close to losing the war against blockbuster.", "So even that aside. Get, why IPO, what's the point of that? You've got the cash position and they're sitting in as 15 million in the bank.", "They're not going to be profitable this quarter, but maybe the next, and it's going to be super thin.", "So like you need cash from somewhere. Why does this business need cash and what is the flywheel?", "I think the flywheel is more spend, gets you more customers, which gives you. More leverage with content providers, which isn't really a huge factor in their business yet, but there are, there's gotta be some element of, yeah.", "Buying, you know, they're already buying DVDs in mass, so they sort of need to be able to do that to serve more customers.", "And you can buy deeper in the tail when you have more customers. They eventually do, do deals with movie studios as they get bigger, to buy DVDs at a discount.", "Yup. So that gets you more and better content, which then makes you able to, the inherently, that improves the product offering, which then lets you go get more customers.", "And so, I mean, it really, it's, it's a flywheel business that they're, they're raising cash to pour onto it.", "So competitive stuff aside, they should have just gone out and raised as much as they possibly could, have to be able to fuel that, that flywheel faster.", "I mean, it's not like they could have raised any more and it doesn't feel like the stock price could have been any higher given the macro economic climate they were in.", "So the way I look at this, they raise the most money they could, which was the good idea. Even if they didn't need it for competitive reasons, which they did it.", "It was a good idea timing wise and a an amount wise. So you know, it's not an a plus for me because those are reserved for exceptional circumstances, but this is a solid day.", "Yeah. I think. One thing I wanted to add on to the the flywheel aspect. We thought about this a lot at Rover actually, um, which is not a subscription business, but has some of the same dynamics with a business like this subscription business.", "Once you grow to a certain point, as you're growing, you're spending a ton of money on customer acquisition, bringing new people in, and as we talked about in the early stages of the market, so much the market has yet to come.", "There comes a point. Where you flip from all of that money that you're spending on customer acquisition.", "You're not making that back in terms of the revenue you're getting from your subscribers. You're spending more than the money you're getting back, but at a certain point in the market, in the adoption phase.", "That flips where you are now. You're still spending as fast as you can, but your subscriber space is so big, they're generating so much cash that you now like your economics tip over into the positive.", "Once that happens, you can super quickly go from like a, you know, cash burning business as we saw to like an incredibly, immensely profitable.", "Immensely big moat because for anybody else to come compete with you , they'd have to spend the same amount that you spent along the way to get there.", "Amazon could credibly do that, but nobody else could. And once Netflix did that, that's when. As far as the DVD business concerned.", "Oh, was concerned. Uh, that's when they tipped into like, we are an awesome business. It's very stable cash flows.", "It's the same thing with cable companies. This is how they work.", "Uh, or it worked. So yeah, I think it was like, they absolutely needed that capital to do that. I think, yeah, I debate a or a minus.", "Um, certainly a range because they needed to, they executed. It was great. They did what they had to do.", "It just, the market conditions were so bad that like. Selling that much with a company, like, you know, um, so not ideal, but I don't think they really had any other choice.", "So I don't know. A or a minus. All right. Carve outs. Carve outs. Okay. So mine, uh, I'll go, uh, quickly, uh, I can't believe it's taken me this long.", "To read and then recommend a N, K Jemisons SkyFii trilogy, the broken earth trilogy. These books are amazing, amazing.", "If you haven't read them yet, if you're a scifi fan, even if you're not a scifi fan, so three books in the trilogy, each one of them, the first one, when the Hugo award in.", "2015, I think. 15 or 16. The second one, one that you go where the next year, the third one, when the Hugo word the following year.", "So, so, so good. Um, and just like a perfect societal commentary for, you know, the era we're into where like, it's, uh, a persecuted people have an immense power that, uh, can save the world.", "Uh, but they're persecuted and like, so you have to give her anyway. It's really, really good. Must read.", "I have one. I had a list of articles that I've read recently that I thought were good, and then I was like, you know, I should do one that's just like something kind of fun.", "And I thought it was going to be completely unrelated to the episode, but, uh, I'm now realizing it's not at all.", "There's a Netflix show that I've been watching called the good place, and, uh, it's with Kristen bell.", "It is really goofy, but really good and really good, sort of just like. Popcorn, uh, you know, watch it for a half hour before you fall asleep.", "It's that, it's, it's basically like a heaven and hell, uh, thing where Kristen bell lands in the good place", "and she's looking around and she's like, Oh, cool, I'm in the good place, so I'm not in the bad place then.", "And she's like talking to the administrator of the good place and it's, it's just like, it's very tongue in cheek, but, um, really good.", "And, uh, uh, when I picked it, I didn't realize that it was a Netflix show, but, um, Netflix original content coming soon and in the, in the next episode.", "Well, thank you to our awesome sponsor of all of season three.", "Silicon Valley bank couldn't do the show without you guys.

If streaming is like traditional entertainment, this is reasonable.", "Or you could listen to the market, which is projecting that Netflix will achieve $11 billion in FCF in 2026, five years away.", "In other words, using some very reasonable situations, we don’t know if Netflix has validated their strategy.", "What we can say is that Netflix spent a lot of money for years, and now they need to make a lot in the future to justify that investment.", "I mean, even our breakeven scenario demands a free cash flow growth rate of 137%!

They invested in tons of content, and all the subscriber growth justified it.", "Indeed, that’s a headline I saw repeated in countless articles and many entertainment newsletters.", "Reality is somewhere in between.

Did their investment in tons of content drive that? Surely.", "But did Netflix achieve positive growth, almost by accident, because they paused all global productions?", "Probably! Indeed, in Q4, Netflix said they were back to full-production on their shows, and not surprisingly, they were cash flow negative again.", "The link seems fairly clear: when Netflix spends at their current level on content, they lose money.", "How do we prove it one way or the other? We can’t, but I will point to this fun thought experiment. On the earnings call after the Q4 results were released, Netflix said that they won’t even bother forecasting subscribers in 2021.", "They said it’s much too difficult, and only forecast adding 6 million subscribers in Q1.", "All finance boils down to this: money you make and money you spend. If Netflix has said they can’t reliably forecast how much money they will make, how can they confidently know they will break even in 2021?", "Because of what Netflix can control. Costs. Which means content costs. If Netflix is forecasting breakeven in 2021, but they have no idea how many subscribers they’ll grow by, they’re basically saying they’ll ensure they get there by right-sizing content costs to break even.", "Meaning they’ll cut costs if they need to break even.", "The implications of this are, in fact, the exact opposite of every smart pundit saying Netflix has justified its content spend.", "If anything, 2021 showed Netflix—almost by accident!—that they were much too aggressive on making original content.", "Sans Coronavirus, likely Netflix loses $2 billion again in 2020, then tries to lower that in 2021 to break even.", "This ties to the strategic point above.

Larcker is James Irvin Miller Professor of Accounting and Brian Tayan is a Researcher with the Corporate Governance Research Initiative at Stanford Graduate School of Business.", "We recently published a paper on SSRN, Netflix Approach to Governance: Genuine Transparency with the Board, that explains the unique and innovative board practices of Netflix.", "The hallmark of good corporate governance is an independent-minded board of directors to oversee management and represent the interests of shareholders.", "Its primary responsibilities are to hire and replace the CEO as needed, monitor performance, review and approve strategy, and assess financial reporting and risk management.", "In a typical corporation, the vast majority of this work is carried out through board meetings and specialized board committees.", "However, it is not clear that directors receive the information they need to make fully informed decisions on all key matters.", "Partly, this is due to an “information gap” that exists between management and the board: Directors have a less-complete understanding of the company and the market than executives because of their limited exposure to day-to-day activities and their independence from the business.", "Directors only meet 4 to 8 times per year in full board meetings, and 2 to 8 times in committee meetings.", "The information they review generally consists of dense PowerPoint presentations with extensive tables and graphs that span, in a typical large corporation, hundreds of pages.", "Some directors find these presentations heavy on data but light on the analysis and insights needed to fully understand the quality of management, decision making, and performance.", "Boardroom dynamics can further impede information flow, particularly in settings where the CEO maintains strict control over the content presented, when presentations are carefully scripted, when follow-up beyond one or two questions is discouraged due to time, and when presentations are made by only a limited number of executives—such as the CEO, CFO, general counsel, and not others.", "While fiduciary rules allow directors to rely exclusively on information provided by management, dynamics such as these can reduce the quality of that information and impair their ability to make good decisions on behalf of shareholders.", "Netflix takes a radically different approach to information sharing with the goal of significantly and efficiently increasing transparency among the CEO, executive team, and board of directors.", "The Netflix approach incorporates two highly unique practices: (1) board members periodically attend (in an observing capacity only) monthly and quarterly senior management meetings, and (2) board communications are structured as approximately 30-page online memos in narrative form that not only include links to supporting analysis but also allow open access to all data and information on the company’s internal shared systems including the ability to ask clarifying questions of the subject authors.", "This quarterly memo is written by and shared with the top 90 executives as well as the board.", "Founder and CEO Reed Hastings believes that these two practices improve the ability of the board to provide what he calls an “extreme duty of care” to the corporation: “The board isn’t going to have the confidence to make hard decisions unless they really understand the market and the company.”", "Netflix board members embrace the Netflix approach to board governance. In the words of one board member:", "Reed’s belief is that a competent and honest executive team knows dramatically more about what’s going on in the company than a board, and so the board’s involvement should be at very strategic levels.", "… For a board to function well in that regard, it has to know a lot about the company.", "To make sure that you have the right CEO in the chair, you need to understand the issues of the day, and you need to understand what qualities, attributes, and background experience would make this the right CEO to run this company for maximum shareholder return.", "This level of data, this level of access, and this level of conversation greatly facilitates our ability to be good board members.", "The first element of the Netflix approach to governance is board attendance at executive and senior executive meetings.", "Netflix holds three regularly scheduled executive meetings:", "- Reed’s Staff meetings (R-Staff) are monthly meetings of the top 7 executives to discuss the most important strategic and organizational issues facing the company.", "- Executive Staff meetings (E-Staff) are quarterly meetings of the top 90 executives consisting of presentations and breakout sessions to review strategic issues, competitive threats, workplace issues, and policies.", "- Quarterly Business Reviews (QBR) are 2-day gatherings of the top 500 employees of the company that include a quarterly review of the business, presentations, crowd-sourced discussion topics, and group dinners.", "One board member attends R-Staff meetings, 1 to 2 attend E-Staff meetings, and 2 to 4 attend Quarterly Business Reviews.2 Directors who attend these meetings are expected to observe but not influence or participate in the discussion.", "According to Hastings, “I don’t want the management meeting to be any different because they’re there.”", "Directors can follow up with the CEO or other executives after the meetings with questions. They are also free to share what they have learned with fellow board members in subsequent board meetings.", "The purpose of director attendance is primarily educational: By directly observing management, directors will have a greater understanding of the range of issues facing the company, the analytical approach that underpins managerial decisions, and the full scope of the tradeoffs involved.", "Ultimately, the aspiration is that this will translate to significantly more confidence in management and its choices.", "It’s an efficient way for the board to understand the company better. In the early days it was mostly [to ensure]", "that if we got an over-the-top offer, the board wouldn’t sell too cheap, because they would really understand and be confident that there is a long-term play here.", "That was my motivation.… Now, seeing how helpful it is for them to do their role well, we’ve made it our standard practice.", "Board members value direct attendance of these meetings because it increases their knowledge of the company and its management:", "It’s a good opportunity for board members to see the team in action and to meet several layers of the team.", "… You end up with a more committed board, a more knowledgeable board, not people who just drop in for dinner and a meeting.", "It just gives you a far better understanding of the company. You get to know all of the operating players.", "You get a feel for the move, the cadence, how people think, how people contribute, how people interact with each other.", "And of course, you get an understanding of the issues of the day.", "You see a different level of dynamic of the executive team. You really see how different individuals contribute, you see their expertise, you see the voice that they have around the table, and you see the dynamic with the CEO.", "You see how the topics that have been discussed, resolved, and reported on in a board meeting actually got processed.", "The fact that directors are invited to all those, and encouraged to come, and encouraged to meet and mingle with people up and down the organization is unique and shows an immense amount of confidence on the part of the senior leadership.", "Netflix directors believe that direct exposure to active strategic discussions gives them substantially deeper knowledge of the company than orchestrated visits to company offices or facilities.", "One director contrasts Netflix with another company where interactions between the board and executives are “much more scripted, more formal, … all very carefully orchestrated.", "This is definitely more natural.” In the words of a Netflix executive, “Reed doesn’t try to edit us or tell us what to present.”", "Beyond informing directors about the company, board attendance at senior executive meetings builds rapport and trust between the board and senior managers.", "It also positions the board well for an eventual CEO succession:", "Board members have a very high understanding of what would make for a great CEO of this company. We understand the landscape, we understand how the company operates, etc.", "And so when we do get to a conversation about succession planning, there is a high level of understanding.", "… We would be starting from a much better position.", "The second element of the Netflix approach to governance is a board memo with links to supporting analysis and open access to all shared files on the company’s secured intranet.", "The board memo itself consists of 20 to 40 pages of written text that highlights business performance, industry trends, competitive developments, and other strategic and organizational issues.", "[3] High-level data is summarized in charts and graphs, but the memo’s emphasis is primarily the written discussion and analysis of issues.", "Embedded links within each section of the memo connect the reader to supplemental analysis, data, and details that support and expand the written discussion.", "Board members receive the memo a few days prior to board meetings and are self-directed in reviewing the material and clicking through to review supplemental analysis on topics or issues they believe are most important, interesting, or require the most attention from a fiduciary standpoint.", "Directors estimate they spend 4 to 6 hours in preparation, which is more than they spend preparing for their other directorships but also claim it is more interesting.", "They have the ability to pose questions or ask for clarification directly within the digital memo, to which senior management responds prior to the meeting.", "[4] Directors take active advantage of this capability.", "The memo is shared among all the VPs, the top 90 executives, and so it’s a way of alignment because I backbone it and captain it, but there are a bunch of sections written by the specialist in the functions.", "That is shared, the whole management team reads this, and they all have access to the board memo. … Directors then have full-view rights across the company’s documents, so they just click and explore and click and explore to see the analysis of various programs.", "According to David Wells, Netflix chief financial officer:", "[The board memo] is part of the evolution from a presentation culture to a memo-based culture [internally across the company]. …", "Once you have the ability to effectively write collaboratively, you can then graduate to a memo that is collaboratively written.", "… The central coordinator, if there is one, is likely Reed himself or my Financial Planning & Analysis group.", "Or, for each of the areas that are writing these deeper memos, they have the C-level owner take responsibility for that.", "Because directors are extensively prepared, board meetings themselves are significantly more efficient, with a focus on questions and discussion rather than presentation.", "Meetings are only 3 to 4 hours in length (compared to all day or multiple days at many large corporations).", "They begin with the CEO and directors listing the main questions on a white board and proceed immediately to discussion.", "Senior executives attend board meetings and answer questions if needed.5", "Netflix directors are very positive about the level of information they receive through the memo and supporting analysis, and the impact that these have on board meetings and discussion:", "I think it makes a board more nimble. It makes the board more connected than they would otherwise be to the business, and it’s mobile.", "I don’t have to be in a specific room to get information. The information is always with me. I can always refer back.", "I’ve never seen anything like that with any other board that I’ve been on. We’re exposed to a huge amount of information about the company.", "As a result, the board meetings are a relatively small amount of presentation and a fair amount of questions, and those questions are pretty well informed.", "It’s not that the board memo is the board meeting. It isn’t. It’s all of your background reading before you go into the room so that you can have an intelligent and informed conversation.", "The general notion of open access, I think, is very useful across the board … The degree to which you have access is the degree to which you can be helpful.", "It is a process that takes what is the accumulation of a huge amount of data that is processed on a daily basis by the company and distills it down in a consumable format for the board.", "It then allows us to tease out the questions that are most important to the business in the board meeting.", "… It has made the board meetings … incredibly more efficient. … Not everybody is a data-centric kind of thinker, and not everybody thinks well through slides, but almost everybody thinks well through a narrative.", "The Netflix approach to board governance is rooted in and reflective of the company’s culture and leadership.", "The Netflix culture emphasizes individual initiative, the sharing of information, and a focus on results rather than processes.", "[6] According to David Hyman, the company’s general counsel:", "Our culture deck and the way in which we operate with the board are intertwined. Everything from “freedom and responsibility,” “candor,” “context not control,” and “transparency.”", "All of those play together and work well. It would be incongruous to have this interesting culture and then have a board that was kept in a box.", "Board members speak very highly of the company culture and its application to the boardroom:", "Reed has always been masterful at hiring really good people, pushing decision making to those people and not micromanaging.", "Letting decisions roll up and be debated rather than micromanaged. … That style, that kind of management philosophy rolls up into the board meetings where any one of the members of Reed’s staff can comment or disagree, or take questions from any of us around the table and answer them openly.", "A lot of CEOs like the notion of transparency. The difference is that Reed has decided to put mechanisms in place like QBR, E-Staff, and R-Staff that actually make it happen.", "The overall tone Reed has set, really from early days, is around transparency. … There is no editorializing.", "It’s just a deep desire to hear rational, well-argued pros and cons of any decision.", "While Netflix has been highly successful as a corporation, its success has not come without challenges.", "The company faced fierce competition with (at the time) a much larger Blockbuster video for a dominant position in the DVD-subscription market.", "It has made significant and costly decisions to invest in extensive third-party content for its website, expand in international markets, and invest significant dollars in the production of proprietary content.", "It made a significant mistake by deciding to separate its DVD-subscription business from its streaming business in a standalone company called Qwikster.", "[7] The outcomes of these decisions were not known in advance. As Hastings acknowledges, “If you look at the volatility in our stock chart as a proxy, it has not been a smooth kind of rise.”", "Netflix directors believe that its board processes gave the board confidence in management during these challenges:", "There are so many radical major transformative steps that Netflix has done since I’ve been on the board… DVD distribution into streaming over the web, moving into international, committing millions of dollars in content, committing money to making the production.…", "It’s fascinating as a board member.… The management team is so thoughtful and open to dissension in the decision-making process that it makes very challenging decisions relatively easier because of the rigor of the process.", "Netflix has made two big “chasm crossings” and most companies don’t even do one. One was getting from DVD to streaming, and number two going to streaming licensing to original content.", "It was a huge leap, and it’s hard to imagine we could have done it without the intimate knowledge of the operations and the people.", "We would have been much slower to invest so much money in content. There would have been more second-guessing if there wasn’t this completely open perspective.", "How we implemented Qwikster was a little ham-handed. … If we did not have that level of transparency and comfort with fellow board members and executives, I do not think we could have had the level of productive discussion that we needed to move forward.", "An unanswered question is whether the Netflix approach to board governance would work at other companies.", "Some directors are unequivocal advocates: “The things that Reed does that we do at the board are things that should become best practices.”", "Others offer a more tempered view: “I think it could be replicated in a small company. I don’t know how you could do it at an older, established company.”", "… “A modified version of it could work at other companies. Board members would really have to be trained to use the tools.", "You’d have to do it in a way that works with the culture.”", "Hastings cautions that directors granted this level of access to management discussion and documentation need to exercise self-restraint about influencing decisions outside the boardroom.", "- The Netflix approach to board governance rests on two practices—periodic board attendance at management meetings and a board memo in narrative form with open access to supporting data—the purposes of which are to significantly increase transparency, data, and information flow between management and directors.", "Does “genuine transparency” improve board decisions? How important have Netflix’s board practices been to the company’s success?", "Do they have a tangible impact on strategic decisions and financial performance?", "- Fiduciary rules allow directors to rely on information provided by management to inform its decisions and satisfy their fiduciary duties.", "Are these standards sufficient, or do they allow some CEOs to control and effectively limit the information presented to the board?", "Would boards benefit from more active interaction with the management team and an open view of its decision-making processes?", "- Netflix directors are overwhelmingly positive about the company’s approach to board governance. How transferable are these practices to other companies?", "Would they work at all companies, or do they require a specific culture, leadership, or phase of development to be effective?", "What qualities are required of a CEO to be willing to engage and interact with the board in this manner?", "Are these practices divisible? Could a company adopt one but not the other and still benefit from greater transparency?", "1All quotations are from interviews with the authors in February and March 2018. Interviews were conducted with Reed Hastings (CEO), select senior executives, and seven outside board members.", "Some quotations are edited lightly for clarity.(go back)", "2Attendance is voluntary. R-staff and E-staff meetings are limited to this number of directors, because of the size of the meetings.", "Director attendance at QBR is not limited.(go back)", "3The company credits Amazon with the original concept of using memos to organize managerial meetings.", "Netflix extends this practice significantly by applying it to the boardroom and by using the memo as a gateway to provide open access to all internal supporting documents.(go back)", "4To the extent there are concerns that the memos or comments may be subject to discovery in a legal matter, the company’s general counsel is mindful but believes that enabling candid discussion and efficient information flow outweigh such discovery risk.(go back)", "5Committee meetings—such as audit, compensation, and nominating and governance—retain the standard format, and take place prior to the full board meetings.(go back)", "6The company’s culture statement notes: “We share documents internally broadly and systematically.

The $131 million figure Netflix repeatedly cited is the amount of cash income taxes the company paid worldwide in 2018, and the same income tax note that is the source for ITEP’s estimate of zero federal and state income tax liability makes it clear that every last dime of the company’s 2018 income tax liability is foreign tax paid on foreign income.", "Put another way, Netflix is responding to the observation that it paid no U.S. income taxes in 2018 by observing that it did pay income taxes somewhere else in the world.", "While this finding may come as some relief to tax authorities in some of the countries that have been victimized by Netflix’s tax avoidance in the past (most notably Britain, where Netflix paid no income tax on £500 million in 2018), it is utterly irrelevant to the policy discussion here in the United States.", "Before the passage of the so-called Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) in late 2017, it was widely recognized that many of the biggest and most profitable corporations were routinely finding ways to zero out their federal income taxes.", "As an ITEP report found that year, 100 companies in the Fortune 500 found ways to pay a zero percent tax rate in at least one profitable year between 2008 and 2015.", "Netflix did it twice—which is why we were especially interested to see what the company’s new financial report revealed about its U.S. taxes in 2018, the first full year of the new corporate tax law.", "Would the companies that got away with tax avoidance under the old rules continue to do so under the new law?", "The company’s new report makes it quite clear that Netflix is every bit as much unaffected by the U.S. corporate income tax now as it was before the passage of President Trump’s corporate tax cut.", "That’s bad news for the middle-income working families and small businesses who must pick up the slack when huge corporations don’t pay their fair share—and Netflix’s assertion that there is some other country in the world where they did pay income tax last year doesn’t make this news any less bad.", "The company’s aggressive effort to seek retractions from media outlets covering this story appears to be based on fear, not facts."]}

Akamai excludes acquisition-related costs from its non-GAAP financial measures to provide a useful comparison of Akamai's operating results to prior periods and to its peer companies because such amounts vary significantly based on the magnitude of the acquisition transactions and do not reflect Akamai's core operations.", "- Restructuring charges – Akamai has incurred restructuring charges that are included in its GAAP financial statements, primarily related to workforce reductions and charges associated with exiting facility lease commitments.", "Akamai excludes these items from its non-GAAP financial measures when evaluating its continuing business performance as such items vary significantly based on the magnitude of the restructuring action and do not reflect expected future operating expenses.", "In addition, these charges do not necessarily provide meaningful insight into the fundamentals of current or past operations of its business.", "- Amortization of debt discount and issuance costs and amortization of capitalized interest expense – In August 2019, Akamai issued $1,150 million of convertible senior notes due 2027 with a coupon interest rate of 0.375%.", "In May 2018, Akamai issued $1,150 million of convertible senior notes due 2025 with a coupon interest rate of 0.125%.", "The imputed interest rates of these convertible senior notes were 3.10% and 4.26%, respectively. This is a result of the debt discounts recorded for the conversion features that are required to be separately accounted for as equity under GAAP, thereby reducing the carrying value of the convertible debt instruments.", "The debt discounts are amortized as interest expense together with the issuance costs of the debt. The interest expense excluded from Akamai's non-GAAP results is comprised of these non-cash components and is excluded from management's assessment of the company's operating performance because management believes the non-cash expense is not representative of ongoing operating performance.", "- Legal settlements – Akamai has incurred losses related to the settlement of legal matters. Akamai believes excluding these amounts from its non-GAAP financial measures is useful to investors as the types of events giving rise to them are not representative of Akamai's core business operations.", "- Endowment of Akamai Foundation – Akamai has incurred expenses to endow the Akamai Foundation, a private corporate foundation dedicated to encouraging the next generation of technology innovators by supporting math and science education.", "Akamai's first endowment was in 2018 to enable a permanent endowment for the Akamai Foundation to allow it to expand its reach.", "In the fourth quarter of 2020 Akamai supplemented the endowment to enable specific initiatives to increase diversity in the technology industry.", "Akamai believes excluding these amounts from non-GAAP financial measures is useful to investors as these infrequent and nearly one-time expenses are not representative of its core business operations.", "Akamai Statement Under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act", "This release and/or our investor conference call scheduled for later today contain information about future expectations, plans and prospects of Akamai's management that constitute forward-looking statements for purposes of the safe harbor provisions under The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, including statements about expected future financial performance and the benefits of the planned acquisition of Guardicore.", "Actual results may differ materially from those indicated by these forward-looking statements as a result of various important factors including, but not limited to, inability to continue to generate cash at the same level as prior years; failure of Guardicore's technology to interoperate as expected with existing Akama technology; inability to increase our revenue at the same rate as in the past and keep our expenses from increasing at a greater rate than our revenues; and other factors that are discussed in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, and other documents periodically filed with the SEC.", "In addition, the statements in this press release and on such call represent Akamai's expectations and beliefs as of the date of this press release.", "Akamai anticipates that subsequent events and developments may cause these expectations and beliefs to change.", "However, while Akamai may elect to update these forward-looking statements at some point in the future, it specifically disclaims any obligation to do so.", "These forward-looking statements should not be relied upon as representing Akamai's expectations or beliefs as of any date subsequent to the date of this press release.", "Akamai secures and delivers digital experiences for the world's largest companies.

Annual revenue reports are a classic example of descriptive analytics, along with other reporting such as inventory, warehousing and sales data, which can be aggregated easily and provide a clear snapshot of a company’s operations.", "Another widely used example is social media and Google Analytics tools, which summarise certain groupings based on simple counts of events like clicks and likes.", "Whilst descriptive data can be useful to quickly spot trends and patterns, the analysis has its limitations.", "Viewed in isolation, descriptive analytics may not give the full picture. For more insight, you need delve deeper.", "Predictive analytics is a more advanced method of data analysis that uses probabilities to make assessments of what could happen in the future.", "Like descriptive analytics, prescriptive analytics uses data mining – however it also uses statistical modelling and machine learning techniques to identify the likelihood of future outcomes based on historical data.", "To make predictions, machine learning algorithms take existing data and attempt to fill in the missing data with the best possible guesses.", "These predictions can then be used to solve problems and identify opportunities for growth. For example, organisations are using predictive analytics to prevent fraud by looking for patterns in criminal behaviour, optimising their marketing campaigns by spotting opportunities for cross selling and reducing risk by using past behaviours to predict which customers are most likely to default on payments.", "Another branch of predictive analytics is deep learning, which mimics human decision-making processes to make even more sophisticated predictions.", "For example, through using multiple levels of social and environmental analysis, deep learning is being used to more accurately predict credit scores and, in the medical field, it is being used to sort digital medical images such as MRI scans and X-rays to provide an automated prediction for doctors to use in diagnosing patients.", "Whilst predictive analytics shows companies the raw results of their potential actions, prescriptive analytics shows companies which option is the best.", "The field of prescriptive analytics borrows heavily from mathematics and computer science, using a variety of statistical methods.", "Although closely related to both descriptive and predictive analytics, prescriptive analytics emphasises actionable insights instead of data monitoring.", "This is achieved through gathering data from a range of descriptive and predictive sources and applying them to the decision-making process.", "Algorithms then create and re-create possible decision patterns that could affect an organisation in different ways.", "What makes prescriptive analytics especially valuable is their ability to measure the repercussions of a decision based on different future scenarios and then recommend the best course of action to take to achieve a company’s goals.", "The business benefit of using prescriptive analytics is huge. It enables teams to view the best course of action before making decisions, saving time and money whilst achieving optimal results.", "Businesses that can harness the power of prescriptive analytics are using them in a variety of ways. For example, prescriptive analytics allow healthcare decision-makers to optimise business outcomes by recommending the best course of action for patients and providers.", "They also enable financial companies to know how much to reduce the cost of a product to attract new customers whilst keeping profits high.", "Despite the clear benefits of using data analytics in decision making, many organisations are still lacking the skills they need to optimise them.", "Data analytics is a complex discipline. Less than a quarter of businesses currently describe themselves as data driven and Forbes reports that nearly all businesses cite the need to manage unstructured data as being a problem for their organisation.", "There is a growing skills gap for business professionals who can manipulate and interpret data.", "“The ideal candidate for businesses in 2021 and beyond will be a person who can both understand and speak data — because in a few short years, data literacy will be something employers demand and expect.", "Those who want to get ahead are acquiring these talents now” says ThoughtSpot CEO Sudheesh Nair.", "Studying for a Business Analytics online MSc gives you the data and decision analysis skills businesses need to turn big data into knowledge.", "Run by the EQUIS-accredited Bath School of Management, the Business Analytics online MSc course offers you access to the latest data insights, management principles and industry expertise, providing you with essential skills to lead change in today’s data-focused industries.", "For more information request information by filling in our online form below."]}
