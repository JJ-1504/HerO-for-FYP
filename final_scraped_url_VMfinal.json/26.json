"5.2.2.Expanding the scope of the EU ‘Bolar patent/SPC exemption’ to allow for advance manufacturing for export purposes", "The Bolar patent exemption, defined by Articles 10(6) of Directive 2001/83 on the Community code relating to medicinal products for human use and Articles 13(6) of Directive 2001/82 on the Community code relating to medicinal products for veterinary use, allows small-scale manufacturing of generics/biosimilars to take place during the patent/SPC protection period of the reference medicine, in order to conduct the testing required to obtain regulatory approval.", "The aim of this exception is to speed up the regulatory approval of generic/biosimilar medicines, and their entry into the market once the patent/SPC of the reference medicine has expired.", "In theory, one option could hypothetically be to expand the scope of the Bolar exemption to include manufacturing for export and/or stockpiling for EU day-1 entry (see the Roland-Berger study).", "However, submissions received in the context of the public consultation did not identify this as an option.", "In addition, given that the Bolar exemption applies to both SPCs and patents, expanding the Bolar exemption to allow for export manufacturing and stockpiling during the patent term could conflict with Article 28 of TRIPS.", "A specific type of license could be defined, which would be applied for by a generic/biosimilar company and granted by a competent authority, or alternatively negotiated with an SPC-holder under the supervision of a competent public authority, free of charge or against payment of a license fee.", "This option would bring transparency for the SPC-holders that could identify and monitor the beneficiaries of such a license.", "However, from the perspective of generic companies, the administrative procedures would involve costs and time delays, making it uncertain whether applying for a license would be economically sound.", "Moreover, SPC holders could tactically delay the grant of a license (e.g. via multiple appeals) making investment for generics very uncertain, or asking for unreasonably high royalties.", "Cutting down SPC maximum duration (for instance, to the 2 years provided for in CETA) would reduce the EU SPC protection asymmetry with respect to most third countries.", "-It would significantly affect the current period of exclusivity (of up to 5.5 years in total) enjoyed by SPC holders with respect to placing their products on the EU market (it should be stressed that none of the retained options of this impact assessment affect this core exclusivity of SPC holders).", "Such a drastic option would go directly against the fundamental objective of SPCs, which is to compensate for the loss of effective patent protection due to development and authorisation procedures.", "-It would not solve the issue of timely day-1 entry onto the EU market, unless the EU SPC protection were completed removed in the EU, i.e. to align the EU with ‘non-SPC’ third countries with manufacturing capacity, such as India.", "Such an approach would roll back and overturn more than 25 years of EU intellectual property policy. It received almost no support from stakeholders in the public consultation (only 1% of the respondents to the public consultation supported this option, and in a different context to the problem definition articulated in this impact assessment).", "Aside from the status quo (option 0), a number of policy options are considered below to ensure that SPC protection in Member States does not prevent EU-based manufacturers of generics and biosimilars from competing on an equal IPR footing with manufacturers based in third countries.", "Apart from the status quo, two broad approaches can be envisaged:", "(1)Soft law approaches based on voluntary industry-led initiatives to allow EU-based manufacturers of generics and biosimilars, during the SPC term of the reference medicine, to manufacture for export and/or stockpile purposes (Option 1).", "(2)Amending the EU SPC legislation so as to allow EU-based manufacturers of generics and biosimilars, during the SPC term of the reference medicine, to manufacture for export and/or stockpile purposes (Options 2 to 4).", "Soft-law approach allowing advance manufacturing for export purposes", "Soft-law approach allowing advance manufacturing for stockpiling purposes", "Export waiver legislation (possibly with anti-diversion measures such as specific labelling)", "Waiver legislation (possibly with anti-diversion measures), which could be an export waiver (to some extent) or a stockpiling waiver", "In total, nine (3 x 3) possible combinations of approaches are possible to tackle the two problems. Six of these combinations would entail different types of approaches to tackle each of the two problems (e.g. the EU SPC regime could be amended so as to allow export during the SPC term, while a soft-law approach would be promoted in order to allow stockpiling so as to facilitate day-1 entry) leading to complex implementation, requiring users to become familiar and develop different operational strategies to achieve the two objectives.", "Among those six combinations, those combining the status quo with another approach might not tackle one of the problems.", "For these reasons, the options analysis below does not address specifically all nine possible combinations, while it nevertheless distinguishes between a waiver for export-only purposes and a waiver for day-1 entry purposes (whose combination constitutes a further option).", "On this basis, the following options can specifically considered regarding the two specific objectives:", "Soft-law approach allowing advance manufacturing for both export & stockpiling purposes", "Legislation on both export and stockpiling waivers", "Not taking any policy action has already been described (cf. the baseline described above).", "The EU would continue to negotiate FTAs with an IPR chapter that includes SPC provisions, but as explained above, this trade approach is not effective to tackle the problems identified (FTA negotiations take years and a number of trade partners successfully resist adopting EU-like SPC protection).", "In this baseline scenario, a few Member States have already considered, or introduced, soft-law measures at national level (e.g. the LEEM-CEPS framework agreement in France – cf. below) aiming to allow advance manufacturing of generics during the patent/SPC term of the reference medicine for timely day-1 entry.", "As mentioned below, such a national non-regulatory approach, while it may be satisfactory in individual cases, is not desirable from the point of view of the single market, especially regarding uniformity, fair treatment and transparency.", "These national approaches have not led to successful results so far.", "5.3.2.Option 1: voluntary industry-led agreements/‘soft-law’ approaches", "Without requiring any legislative changes, the Commission in collaboration with Member States could try to facilitate further voluntary agreements between generics/biosimilars manufacturers and originators consisting of allowing advance manufacturing of generics during the SPC term of the reference medicine.", "Such voluntary agreements could cover manufacturing export purposes to unprotected third countries and (this option 1)/or for stockpiling purposes for timely day-1 entry onto the EU market.", "5.3.3.Option 2: introducing a manufacturing waiver for export purposes in Regulation 469/2009", "This option envisages an amendment to Regulation 469/2009 to create an exemption to the SPC right that prevents manufacturing of SPC-protected products by non-authorised third parties.", "This waiver for export purposes would allow developers of generic and biosimilar products to manufacture these products in a Member State during the term of the SPC protection, with a view only to exporting them to third countries with shorter or no SPC protection.", "This waiver (for export-only) would also exempt a reasonable temporary storage that would happen between production and effective export of batches.", "Such temporary storage/stockpiling could not be used for day-1 entry onto the EU market (i.e. the entire production under the waiver of this option 2 being exclusively for export markets).", "However, manufacturers producing in the EU under this (export-only) waiver could be better prepared for timely entry into the EU market by scaling up their established production on day-1.", "Therefore, indirectly this option 2 also tackles to some extent the objective 2 (timely day-1 entry).", "Its effectiveness in this latter regard would depend on the capability of firms to rapidly scale up production to meet demand.", "5.3.4.Option 2-bis: implementing Option 2 with anti-diversion measures", "Anti-diversion measures could consist of any of the following: a special labelling requirement, a notification requirement, a right to conduct inspections by the SPC holder, or the introduction of a reversal of the burden of proof in case of litigation.", "This could reduce the risk that that some of the products manufactured in a Member State under the waiver could end up on the market of that or another (SPC-protected) Member State.", "Section 6.4. further discusses several anti-diversion measures and their impact.", "The design of specific anti-diversion measures would need both to take into consideration the level of additional burden for SMEs (See Annex 16 on SME Test) and to address confidentiality concerns.", "5.3.5.Option 3: introducing a manufacturing waiver for stockpiling purposes in Regulation 469/2009", "Similar to option 2, under this option, Regulation 469/2009 would be amended to create an exemption to the SPC right that prevents manufacturing of SPC-protected medicines by non-authorised third parties.", "This waiver for stockpiling purposes would allow developers of generic and biosimilar products to manufacture and stockpile these products in the EU during the term of SPC protection, with a view to being fully ready for timely day-1 entry in Member States.", "5.3.6.Option 3-bis: similarly to option 2-bis above, option 3 could be implemented with anti-diversion measures", "5.3.7.Option 4: introducing a manufacturing waiver for export and stockpiling purposes under Regulation 469/2009", "The SPC waiver proposed under this option would combine the features of the waivers of options 2 and 3.", "It would tackle both identified problems. Thus, this SPC manufacturing waiver for export and stockpiling would allow developers of generic and biosimilar products to manufacture these products in a Member State during the term of the SPC protection with a view not only to exporting them to third countries with shorter or no SPC protection (as in option 2), but also to storing them to be able to enter the EU market as and from day-1 (as in option 3).", "5.3.8.Option 4-bis: similar to options 2-bis and 3-bis, option 4 could be implemented with anti-diversion measures", "5.4.Timing scenarios for applicability of options 2 to 4bis", "In addition to the key options presented above which relate to the substance (i.e. the actual effects) of a waiver, and irrespective of which of them is preferred, a number of choices can be made regarding the ‘time-bound applicability’ of the waiver.", "It should be recalled that each SPC goes through four successive stages: (1) not yet applied for; (2) applied for; (3) granted (but not yet in effect, since the basic patent is still in force), and (4) in effect (i.e. after the basic patent has expired).", "In this context, a waiver could be made applicable as follows (from the broadest to the narrowest capture in terms of SPCs covered):", "-scenario 1: to all SPCs, even those which are already in effect when the waiver is introduced;", "-scenario 2: only to granted SPCs which will enter into effect only after the waiver is introduced;", "-scenario 3: only to SPCs which will be granted after the waiver is introduced (i.e. only to SPC applications);", "-scenario 4: only to SPCs which will be applied for after the waiver is introduced (i.e. only to future SPC applications).", "The respective impact of these scenarios – which anyway will be of a transient nature only – is analysed in section 6.8 below.", "Annex 10 provides further information about the expected numbers of SPCs that would be affected by each of these scenarios.", "Further to the analysis below on the impact of the identified options, the tables in section 7 below provide a detailed description of the impact of the options described above.", "The evolution of the problems related to the baseline scenario (no policy action) is analysed in section 2.3 above: delocalisation of manufacturing of generics and biosimilars and related consequences such as loss of employment in the EU, loss of pharmaceutical-related know-how, and relocation of R&D activities following delocalisation of manufacturing.", "A quantification of lost opportunities can be found in section 6.3 below.", "Whilst option 0 is likely to seriously affect the competitiveness of the EU pharmaceutical industry (in particular but not limited to the generics and biosimilar sectors), it will also entail negative consequences for the (health) public purse and for patients, in terms of security and quality of supply and access to medicines.", "6.2.Impact of option 1: voluntary industry-led agreements", "The impact of voluntary, industry-led initiatives, even if stimulated at EU level, is likely to be limited.", "Indeed, being voluntary, such agreements may be refused by the SPC holder of the reference medicine, may only be adhered to by a few manufacturers of generics/biosimilars, or be subject to dissuasive conditions (e.g. high financial compensation requested by the SPC-holder).", "Experience shows that comparable initiatives launched in some Member States have not been very effective.", "The LEEM-CEPS framework agreement, introduced in 2009 in France, is an example at national level of this soft-law approach.", "It is focused on speeding up day-1 entry of locally manufactured generics and biosimilars, in exchange for compensation to the SPC holder.", "The LEEM-CEPS initiative has provided results for only four medicines since 2009.", "While this option might be helpful in individual cases, it may not be optimal from the perspective of the single market as a whole, as regards uniformity, fair treatment or transparency.", "If however it were pursued, the Commission could accompany such an approach with guidelines clarifying best practice, with the view to reducing the impact of the above-mentioned potential drawbacks.", "It should be noted that neither the public consultation nor the various studies feeding into this impact assessment favoured a voluntary approach to tackle the first identified problem.", "6.3.Impact of option 2: SPC manufacturing waiver for export-only purpose", "The impact of this option has been analysed and discussed by an independent study contracted by the Commission (CRA study) and other studies sponsored by the pharmaceutical industry (2 by generics companies and 4 by the originators industry).", "Annex 12 provides a description and estimations of each of the studies sponsored by industry.", "Whilst there are divergences in opinion and in study results as regards the magnitude of the impact of the introduction of an export waiver in the EU, all studies confirm that the net impacts of such a waiver on the EU’s pharmaceutical trade balance (net sales) and on job creation in the EU would be positive.", "The CRA and OHE (for EFPIA) studies estimate the additional exports for EU-based manufacturers of generics and biosimilars, the potential negative impact on the exports of EU SPC-holders in unprotected markets and the impact on jobs in the EU.", "The CRA study, based on a sample of 117 non-biologics molecules and 17 biologics molecules (representing about 32% of all molecules expiring in the EU over the considered period, per each of the two categories of molecules), for which the SPC term expires later in the EU compared to 8 third countries, estimates that an SPC manufacturing for export-only purposes could result in additional export sales by EU-based production of those generics of EUR 7.6bn and for EU-based production of those biosimilars of between EUR 463m and EUR 2.97bn over 10 years.", "CRA estimates, for that sample, a potential negative impact of this waiver on EU SPC holders’ sales of between EUR 139m to EUR 278m for unprotected non-biologics market and between EUR 868m and EUR 1.7bn for unprotected biologics markets over a 10 year period.", "Therefore, the net additional trade balance for the EU pharmaceutical industry represented by the sample of CRA would be between EUR 6bn to EUR 10bn over 10 years.", "The OHE study reviews some of the assumptions undertaken in the CRA study and recalculates its outcomes, estimating additional sales for EU-based manufacturers ranging between EUR 1.2bn and EUR 3.9bn for the sample over 10 years.", "OHE estimates potential negative loses of exports for EU SPC holders ranging between EUR 298m and EUR 573m (the EU pharmaceutical industry exported EUR 220bn in 2016 according to the EFPIA datacentre).", "Therefore, according to OHE, the additional net trade balance for the EU pharmaceutical industry represented by the CRA sample of molecules over a decade could be between EUR 696m and EUR 3.6bn.", "In terms of job creation, CRA estimates that the additional net exports could be translated into an additional 20 000 to 25 000 direct jobs in the generics and biosimilars sector (assuming constant productivity in the sector).", "OHE estimates that the reduction of exports by the SPC-holders would negatively impact on originator jobs.", "OHE also reduced the estimations of CRA of generic/biosimilar job-growth to between 2 837 to 9 430 new jobs (if SPC-holders lose 10% of their sales).", "However, the OHE calculations fail to take account of the jobs that could be created/retained/transferred across divisions by originators, who are currently investing massively in biosimilars (see annexes 5 and 7).", "These numbers above should be considered as the lower range since, as mentioned above, the effects here are estimated on a sample of 117 non-biological and 17 biological molecules, representing around one-third of the relevant market.", "The Pugatch study focuses exclusively on the potential impact of the waiver on originators based in the EU-28 and Switzerland.", "It estimates that between 0.6% and 1.04% of the global sales of the originators sector could be open to competition (i.e. as opposed to actual losses), if the EU introduces an SPC manufacturing waiver.", "The Pugatch study does not take into account that EU exports by originators can also include biosimilars manufactured by originators.", "Pugatch estimates that those percentages could represent between USD 1.34bn and USD 2.27bn of the global sales by European originators annually.", "However, Pugatch does not estimate which part of those shares opened to competition could be retained by European originators (or taken by their own exports of EU-manufactured biosimilars and generics), and which part will be taken by non-EU originators, EU-generics/biosimilars and non-EU generics/biosimilars.", "In terms of jobs, Pugatch estimates that the share of the exports that could be open to competition represents 4 600 to 7 750 employees in the originators sector.", "It does not estimate how many of those jobs could ultimately be lost, or transferred to the generics/biosimilars branches of other originators benefiting by the waiver.", "Therefore, the labour figures of Pugatch cannot be compared with the ones of CRA and OHE.", "According to the inputs provided to the public consultation, generic and biosimilar companies (63 on-line submissions) support the introduction of an SPC manufacturing waiver.", "56 out of 63 submissions are of the opinion that SPCs disadvantage EU-based generics/biosimilars manufacturers compared with those based in countries with no SPC when exporting their products outside the Union (1 respondent denies this problem, and 2 do not know), and indicate that they would invest more in EU manufacturing and would expect a high increase in their exports (6 submissions expect some competition with the exports of EU SPC holders).", "Originators’ submissions to the consultation reflect their broad opposition to the introduction of an EU SPC waiver: 54 out of 71 originators do not consider that EU-based generics/biosimilars manufacturers face the above problems.", "More specifically, as regards the views of originators, they consider that:", "-It would send a negative policy signal to originator pharmaceutical companies and to trade partners as regards the EU commitment to IP.", "However, it should be recalled that the EU has rolled out SPC protection to third countries via FTAs in favour of originators (according to EFPIA, EU exports to Canada of pharmaceutical products worth EUR 4bn yearly will significantly benefit from the new SPC protection introduced in Canada through CETA).", "-The waiver would erode some of SPC holders’ export sales (45 out of the 71 submissions of originators to the public consultation expressed this concern).", "However, as analysed above, the magnitude of that erosion is limited and compensated by the economic gains expected by the waiver.", "In addition, EU SPC-holders will in the medium term face increasing competition as more and more countries invest in development and manufacturing of generics and biosimilars (annex 7).", "-A waiver would conflict with the Union’s international obligations, notably FTAs concluded by the EU.", "A waiver would complement the Union’s trade policy approach overall. A waiver would also be consistent with existing international trade agreements, such as the Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) between members of the World Trade Organisation (WTO), as well as those free trade agreements (FTAs) that the EU has concluded with third countries and which foresee protection of the nature of supplementary protection, such as CETA, which provides for a manufacturing waiver for export purposes.", "- The waiver would disincentive investments in R&D in the EU and may therefore result in some relocation of R&D outside the EU.", "Despite the waiver, the global IPR protection and enforcement framework in the EU would remain the strongest worldwide.", "Given that an export waiver would have a very limited effect on sales of SPC holders (no effect in protected markets) and does not affect to other major pharmaceutical-specific EU incentives for innovation, there would not be a meaningful negative knock-on effect on R&D incentives for originator products as a result (as the economic gains expected from R&D would be broadly the same).", "-The waiver would create a risk of illicit diversion of generics/biosimilars (made in the EU under the waiver) onto the EU market during the term of SPCs; this risk would be higher since the waiver would allow manufacturing in the EU during the SPC term (see also section 6.4.1).", "A risk of foreign products being illicitly placed on the EU market is already present today. It is kept at bay by the EU’s pharmaceutical legislation and its legislation regarding the enforcement of intellectual property rights.", "In addition, the waiver could be implemented with specific anti-diversion measures, which could actually help reduce the risk of diversion onto the EU market (see section 6.4).", "It should also be noted that there is no evidence of illicit diversion resulting from the existence of the ‘Bolar exemption’ in the EU, which itself if a form of manufacturing waiver for clinical trials purposes (and is available during the term of both patents and SPCs).", "-The exports gained by EU generics/biosimilars manufacturers would compete principally with SPC holders’ products made in the EU (i.e. due to the EU ‘goodwill branded effect’), and only in a negligible way with products made in countries such as China, Brazil or India, in view of the local barriers to imports.", "Contracting manufacturing organisations working under EU or US good manufacturing practice (GMP) are stablished globally.", "Biosimilars are taking up quickly not only in developed countries but globally. Asian plants are also manufacturing for originators, including for those originators’ biosimilars divisions (see section 2.3 and annex 7).", "In relation to supposed local barriers in 3rd countries, the EU trade policy aims to remove those barriers (industry information provided to the Commission indicates that EU-based manufacturers have been able to export to those markets upon expiry of the EU SPC).", "Regarding the feedback of SMEs in the sector of manufacturing of generics and biosimilars, and SMEs devoted to innovative medicines (See Annex 16 – SME Test for further details):", "Among the 63 respondents defining themselves as mostly manufacturers of generics/biosimilars, 12 respondents identified themselves as an SME and 1 as a start-up.", "The vast majority of SMEs manufacturing generics and biosimilars supports the introduction of a waiver in the EU, and considers that the longer duration of SPCs in the Union compared to non-EU countries makes manufacturing in the Union less interesting for them.", "Regarding pharmaceutical innovative SME, among the 71 respondents defining themselves as mostly originators, 2 respondents identified themselves as an SME involved in medicines biotechnology and one as a start-up in the field of biopesticides.", "In addition, several European pharmaceutical associations such as EUCOPE, EBE, and EuropaBio conveyed the views of their start-ups and SME members in their submissions and accompanying letters sent to the Commission during the public consultation.", "A few national innovative pharmaceutical associations focused on start-ups and SMEs-members (Belgium and Germany) also provided their views.", "These associations representing innovative SMEs have expressed concerns that the introduction of a manufacturing waiver would dilute SPC protection and therefore dilute the financial rewards they would receive for their inventions, as well as their possibility to get and secure funding for their innovative R&D (in particular because any process of legislative change might stir up uncertainty and dampen the willingness of financial institutions to invest).", "They also highlight that EU-manufactured generics are likely to compete for market shares in unprotected markets with the original brands and thus decreasing the actual or projected market share of these SMEs products.", "As indicted above, these concerns may however be overstated, as the economic impact on originators of the introduction of a manufacturing waiver would be minimal (SPC holders maintain full SPC-related market exclusivity in the Union).", "Despite the waiver, the global IPR protection and enforcement framework in the EU would remain the strongest worldwide.", "Three associations representing patients and doctors favoured an SPC manufacturing waiver on the grounds that it would promote early competition in the market, and thus more affordable medicines.", "Some replies from public authorities claim that there is an increasing dependency on imports of medicines and APIs.", "Increased dependency on non-EU sources has already led to stakeholder concerns with regard to maintaining security and quality of supply in the Union (as discussed in section 2.3).", "Shifting part of the production established under this export waiver on EU day-1 into the EU (in cases where it is possible to quickly scale up the production to meet the demand), could improve the timely entry of generics and biosimilars into the EU market.", "It should be recalled however that EU-based manufacturers of generics and biosimilars could also achieve additional sales from exports to Member States where SPC protection has not been obtained.", "However, such a situation could in practice be easily prevented by SPC holders by extending SPC protection to all Member States.", "At some point in the future, the possible introduction of an EU unitary SPC title would also be relevant in this context.", "Many stakeholders consider that an amendment of the SPC Regulation to introduce an export-only waiver would not imply any implementation costs for the EU budget, Member State authorities or manufacturers of generics and biosimilars.", "6.4.Impact of option 2-bis: SPC manufacturing waiver for export purpose with anti-diversion measures", "One of the reasons raised by SPC holders to oppose the introduction of an SPC manufacturing waiver is the potential risk of illicit diversion onto the EU market, or onto foreign markets still protected, of generics and biosimilars manufactured in the EU under the waiver (58 of 71 originator respondents to the public consultation expressed this concern).", "Today, any generic or biosimilar product found on the territory of a Member State where an SPC is in effect is considered, by default, to infringe the SPC.", "With a waiver, this would not necessarily be the case anymore, which these stakeholders consider might make the identification of infringing products more difficult.", "Other respondents to the public consultation (coming notably from the generics/biosimilars industry) consider this risk to be low, given that:", "-The supply of medicines is highly regulated by the EU acquis on falsified medicines (Directive 2011/62/EU), which includes:", "oObligatory safety features – a unique identifier and an anti-tampering device - on the outer packaging of medicines;", "oA common, EU-wide logo to identify legal online pharmacies;", "oTough rules on the import of active pharmaceutical ingredients;", "oStrong record-keeping requirements for wholesale distributors.", "-The EU Bolar patent exception also created a type of manufacturing waiver in 2004 for regulatory approval purposes for generics and biosimilars (not for export or stockpiling purposes), and no particular illicit diversion of products has been reported in this context.", "-Already today, generics and biosimilars could potentially try to enter ‘at risk’ (i.e. in breach of existing IP protection in the EU) the EU market via imports from unprotected third countries.", "While opinions regarding the risks of diversion differ, anti-diversion measures could be envisaged in order to minimise any additional risk of diversion and provide additional transparency.", "This would work to the benefit of originator companies, by reducing the risk of exposure to IP infringements compared to the situation today.", "Over 70% of SPC-holding companies who responded to the Max Planck Institute’s survey favoured four different types of anti-diversion measures in the event that a manufacturing waiver were to be introduced in the EU:", "(a)Compulsory special labelling for the products produced under the waiver", "This would require generics/biosimilars manufacturers to affix clear indications or labelling on the product packaging manufactured under a waiver, for export purposes (and/or stockpiling purposes under policy options 3 and 4)", "That special labelling should not conflict with existing labelling requirements for medicines in export markets.", "For example, in the case of medicines for the EU market, Article 54 of Directive 2001/83/EC sets out the labelling requirements for medicines.", "This labelling option was also favoured by SPC-holders and generic/biosimilars manufacturers (over 70% for both categories), should a waiver be introduced.", "However, while such labelling can be expected to be effective in respect of products to be exported under an export waiver (option 2), it appears to be less necessary in respect of products to be stockpiled for EU day-1 entry (options 3 and 4 below) given the already strict traceability requirements imposed by the Directive 2011/62/EU on falsified medicines.", "Regarding the costs associated with special labelling, the sector is already subject to traceability measures in the EU under that Directive.", "As a proxy for estimation of the cost of labelling, the evaluation of Regulation 953/2003 to avoid trade diversion into the EU of certain key medicines found that a pharmaceutical company incurred costs of circa EUR 200 000 between 2003-15 for adding a logo on its packs.", "However, that cost included significant fees derived from the obligation of getting regulatory authorities to amend/extend marketing authorisations for the medicines due to a change of packaging (which might not be necessary to implement this option).", "This would require generics/biosimilars manufacturers to notify SPC holders, or a public body (e.g. by Member State bodies), of their intention to rely on the waiver – possibly with a specification of the quantities and destinations – before starting manufacturing.", "This option would create a slight additional administrative burden for generics/biosimilars manufacturers, and might create confidentiality issues if overly detailed information was required from such manufacturers.", "A notification – combined with the timely publication of the related information – would be beneficial for SPC holders, as it would increase transparency and legal certainty, and facilitate identification by them of possible instances of illicit diversion, as they would have information regarding a manufacturer’s intention to use a waiver in respect of a product.", "An advantage of such notification requirements for generics/biosimilars manufacturers is that the public body to which notifications were sent could publish the notifications, or alternatively give them, under request, to a court (or an equivalent body) in the event of litigation, so as to demonstrate the manufacturer’s good faith.", "In addition, a further safeguard would be the legal obligation on the manufacturer, pursuant to existing IPR enforcement legislation, to ensure that products are not released on the domestic market prior to expiry of the SPC.", "This would require generics/biosimilars manufacturers to inform SPC holders, or a public body, that they have manufactured products under the waiver, for export purposes (and/or stockpiling purposes for options 3 and 4) – possibly with a specification of the quantities and destinations.", "SPC holders could effectively use the information to prepare customs ‘applications for action’ aiming to prevent re-imports.", "The assessment is similar to preceding point b, with slightly increased (ex-post) transparency for originators and an increased administrative burden for generics/biosimilars manufacturers.", "(d)Shifting the burden of proof for infringement from SPC holders to generic manufacturers", "This would require generics/biosimilars manufacturers, when they are found to have manufactured, in a territory where an SPC is in effect, a product covered by an SPC, to prove that the product is intended for export, failing which the product would not enjoy the waiver.", "Any legislation introducing an SPC manufacturing waiver, if accompanied with anti-diversion and transparency measures, would take due account of the cost of such measures (e.g. operative cost, administrative burden), which could potentially have a dissuasive effect regarding the actual use of the waiver.", "The cost of anti-diversion measures would be negligible for major manufacturers, but it could have a more significant impact on SMEs.", "6.4.3.Retained anti-diversion measure for option 2-bis", "In view of the above analysis, the preferred anti-diversion measure for this option 2-bis (an SPC manufacturing waiver for export-only purposes with anti-diversion measures) would be a legal obligation to label products produced under the waiver, and a requirement for any manufacturer of generics or biosimilars intending to make use of the waiver to notify this intention to a Member State public authority, which would publish that information.", "This labelling would allow effective and easy identification of generics/biosimilars to be exported under the waiver, and to check whether they are genuinely in the process of being exported.", "This labelling should be removable once the products have been exported outside the EU, in order not to conflict with any labelling requirement in the countries of destination, nor interfere with possible repackaging.", "The notification requirement would improve transparency for SPC holders. A manufacturer to public authority notification would reduce the risk of collusion between the SPC-holder and potential manufacturers vis-à-vis the option of a manufacturer-to-SPC-holder notification.", "This approach appears to be cost-effective and proportionate, and is favoured by SPC holders as well as manufacturers of generics/biosimilars.", "An amendment of the SPC Regulation to introduce an export-only waiver with anti-diversion measures would not imply any implementation costs for the EU budget and very limited costs for Member State authorities, in relation to receiving the notifications of the intention of firms to use the waiver, publishing the information, and providing it, under request, to a court in the event of litigation.", "As discussed above, the measures should take into account the potential cost of implementation on manufacturers of generics and biosimilars, especially for SMEs.", "6.5.Impact of Option 3: SPC manufacturing waiver for stockpiling purposes", "The impact of this option has been analysed and addressed by the studies contracted by the Commission.", "It should be noted that stakeholder studies have focused mostly on an export-only waiver.", "Generics and biosimilars manufacturers consider that a stockpiling waiver would greatly contribute to level the playing field between the manufacture of generics and biosimilars in the EU versus manufacturers based in third countries with regard to timely EU day-1 entry.", "According to the inputs provided to the public consultation, 53 out of 63 respondents representing generics and biosimilars companies (3 respondents deny this problem, and 3 do not know) consider that SPCs disadvantage EU-based generics and biosimilars manufacturers compared with those based in countries with no SPC when placing their products on the market in the EU immediately after the SPC expires.", "41 submissions by generics and biosimilars companies indicate that they have obtained marketing authorisation(s) in the EU before the expiry of the SPC of the reference medicine (under the Bolar exemption).", "Many of them would be also interested in complementing their ‘early’ marketing authorisations with the possibility of manufacturing for stockpiling purposes (i.e. during the SPC term of the reference medicine) in view of timely entry of their products onto the EU market, or some other mechanism that would have an equivalent effect.", "This stockpiling waiver would also support EU generics/biosimilars manufacturers that are only interested in selling within the EU.", "In this regard, 3,372 pharmaceutical SMEs manufacture in the EU, 1,765 of those SMEs export, and 1,362 of them export outside the EU.", "As discussed under option 2, originators’ submissions to the consultation oppose the introduction of any type of SPC waiver.", "The CRA study estimates that an SPC waiver for stockpiling purposes would result in savings on pharmaceutical expenditure from this earlier competition and therefore lead to a speedier reduction of prices in Member States upon expiry of the SPC.", "CRA conducted a simulation of the impact on pharmaceutical expenditures on the basis of observed delays in generic and biosimilar entry during a sample period (Q1 2008 to Q3 2014) if such delays were reduced by up to 6 months.", "Their analysis indicates that if generic entry were brought forward by 6 months, savings on pharmaceutical expenditure would amount to EUR 1.1bn over a three-year period for the sample examined, due to the faster decline in prices, corresponding to a 4% saving.", "Regarding the biologics market, savings would amount to EUR 15m over a three-year period for a limited sample of 17 molecules examined, which corresponds to a 1% saving (it should be noted that as biosimilar penetration increases over time, the beneficial effects on pharmaceutical expenditure would also increase).", "However, from the perspective of pharmaceutical expenditure, it could be argued that, in the medium to long term, timely entry of generics and biosimilars in the EU would tend to happen anyway from non-EU based producers under the baseline scenario (i.e. without any waiver).", "Therefore, in the long term, and disregarding concerns related to the strength and diversification of the supply chain, the stockpiling feature may not necessarily have such a significant impact on savings to the health systems of those Member States with a sizable national market.", "Patients, as indicated above, would enjoy additional sources of supply of medicines with this stockpiling waiver.", "As explained under option 2, a few patient and health practitioner groups, as well as public health institutions, favoured the SPC manufacturing waiver on the grounds that it would facilitate access to more affordable medicines.", "As mentioned above, such a waiver could potentially reduce the risk of relocation, not only of manufacturing, but also of R&D (in the biologics/biosimilars sector).", "Since a stockpiling-only waiver would likely improve the timely entry of EU-manufactured generics and biosimilars, it could tackle – similar to an export waiver – the concerns expressed by some public authorities and citizens about over-reliance of imported medicines analysed in option 2 above.", "An amendment of the SPC Regulation to introduce this stockpiling-only waiver would not imply any implementation costs for the EU budget and Member State authorities.", "6.6.Impact of Option 3-bis: SPC manufacturing waiver stockpiling purposes with anti-diversion measures", "The labelling measures proposed for option 2-bis above (waiver for export-only purposes with anti-diversion measures) might be unnecessary for this option 3-bis (stockpiling for entry in the EU market) in view of the strict traceability requirements imposed by Directive 2011/62/EU on falsified medicines.", "Among the anti-diversion measures discussed in subsection 6.4.2, the preferred one for this option 3-bis would be a legal obligation for the manufacturer to notify a public body (e.g. a public authority of the Member State of establishment of the production facility) of the launch of production for stockpiling purposes.", "That public body would publish the content of the notification, or store it and provide it, under request, to a court in the event of litigation.", "This would be a simple notification, not generating significant burden or cost on the applicant or the public body.", "An additional safeguard for a manufacturing waiver for stockpiling purposes could consist of confining the effect of the waiver to the final months of the term of the SPC of the reference medicine.", "The introduction of a stockpiling-only waiver with the preferred anti-diversion measure above would imply a negligible cost in additional administrative capacity in for the public body charged with receiving, publishing and dispatching (by a court order) the notification.", "6.7.Impact of Options 4 and 4-bis: SPC manufacturing waiver for export and stockpiling purposes (with anti-diversion measures)", "An SPC manufacturing waiver for both export and stockpiling purposes would address both identified problems (manufacturing for export purposes and for timely entry into EU day-1 markets).", "The implications of these options 4 (and 4-bis) stem from the combination of effects described for options 2, 2 bis, 3 and 3 bis above.", "Options 2 to 4 would be especially beneficial for EU SMEs manufacturing generics or developing biosimilars, because they do not necessarily have access to the necessary funding or skills to outsource or delocalise production outside the EU.", "Anti-diversion measures in options 2-bis, 3-bis and 4-bis should take account of potentially dissuasive costs for SMEs (additional operational costs (e.g. labelling), the need to contract specialised attorneys (e.g. for potentially complex notification procedures, and court proceedings).", "The preferred anti-diversion measure for this option 4-bis would be a combination of the preferred measures for options 2-bis (external labelling and notification for production for export purposes) and 3-bis (notification for production intended for stockpiling).", "6.8.Impact of the options for the timing of the introduction of the manufacturing waiver", "Scenario 1 (namely immediate application to all SPCs, including those which are already in effect when the waiver is introduced): the manufacturing waiver could arguably be viewed as a clarification of the initial objective of SPC protection (which, as explained above, was never intended to prevent exports outside the EU nor day-1 entry onto the EU market after SPC expiry).", "This could justify its immediate entry into force, as happened with the EU Bolar patent exemption in 2004.", "However, this approach is not preferred, as it might negatively affect the acquired (property) rights and legitimate expectations of SPC holders.", "In addition, it is not considered useful since, in respect of SPCs already having taken effect, it would be late at that stage for generics/biosimilars manufacturers to make investment decisions (especially for export purposes).", "These objections are also, to a certain extent, valid for scenario 2 (namely application only to granted SPCs which will enter into effect after the waiver is introduced), and therefore this scenario is not preferred either.", "Scenario 3 (namely application only to SPCs which will be granted after the waiver is introduced) would strike an appropriate trade-off, by making the waiver applicable to specific SPCs within a reasonable timeframe without affecting SPCs already granted, or granted and having taken effect.", "Under this scenario, while only a limited number of SPCs would benefit from the waiver in the first years, the introduction of a waiver in EU SPC legislation would already send a clear political signal, and affect investment decisions by manufacturers of generics/biosimilars (and reduce pressure to relocate outside the Union) well before the waiver starts to become actually applicable to a significant number of – and eventually all – SPCs.", "This scenario would apply to pending SPC applications, but a short transition period could provide an appropriate solution here.", "Scenario 4 (namely application only to SPCs which will be applied for after the waiver is introduced) would result in the waiver only becoming applicable to a substantial percentage of all SPCs only after many years.", "This solution would not address the problems at hand in the short to medium term, and is thus not preferred, considering the urgency to act.", "Table 7.1 provides information comparing the policy options in the light of the criteria of effectiveness (how each option achieves the specific objectives) and efficiency (cost-benefits analysis).", "Table 7.2 compares the impacts of the policy options on stakeholders. (See also Annex 16 for the SME test.)", "For the proportionality assessment and coherence of the preferred option (option 4-bis) see section 8 below.", "None of the options considered can be implemented by Member States individually in a satisfactory matter.", "The problems identified are of an EU dimension. Member States taking unilateral action would lead to a distortion of the single market for pharmaceuticals, one of the core objectives of the exiting SPC Regulation.", "Table 7.1: Comparison of policy options against effectiveness and efficiency criteria", "Objective 2: Allow timely EU market entry from day-1", "(≈) Such agreements would not necessarily be available for all G/B manufacturers, as each agreement would require case-by-case negotiation.", "Risk of delays in starting exports (SPC holder can file appeals or delay negotiations).", "This uncertainty would likely prevent G/B manufacturers from making upfront investment decisions (in the EU) based on the hypothetical possibility that such agreements might be made in some cases several years later.", "Benefits (≈): No major changes expected in investment in the EU.

Its brief centered on the value of patent rights to “pioneering biological inventions” arising in university research.", "It argued for “recruitment of commercial entities willing to undertake the huge investments necessary to refine and develop foundational university research into medical and biopharmaceutical products,” although in this case Lilly made just such investments independent of the patents, well before the patent issued, and it is quite clear that patents were not needed to pursue applications of the NF kappa B pathway.", "Indeed, drug function was not precisely known at the time the compounds at stake in this case were first explored as therapeutics.", "The university amicus brief asserts, demonstrably falsely in this case, that denial of patent protection would keep “important and possibly life-saving advancements out of the public’s reach” but, more to the point, would deprive “universities and research institutions of the opportunity to generate funds for continued scientific research, education, and innovation” (171, p. 9).", "The deep irony of this position is clear and addressed in the 2005 National Academies report that surveyed scientists who study the NF kappa B pathway (219).", "The research that academic scientists studying NF kappa B conducted clearly infringed one or more of the 203 claims in US Patent No. 6,410,516.", "In arguing for broad claims on “pioneering biological inventions” to enable collection of royalty streams, the brief thus implies but does not state explicitly that issuing such claims can avoid harm to research only with discretionary and highly selective enforcement of the resulting exclusive rights—most notably, not enforcing patents against university researchers, but by implication commercial users are fair game.", "The research system works because university scientists pervasively ignore the rights that technology licensing officials at the same universities argue are necessary to generate income.", "A story that began with university research of fundamental scientific value, as well as considerable commercial promise, has led to patents on seminal recombinant DNA technology in 1980 and now to a pending appellate court decision about the breadth of patent rights to a pleiotrophic transcriptional pathway.", "Universities find themselves speaking out of both sides of their mouths, arguing for the virtues of commercialization and the social value of exclusive rights that their own scientists routinely ignore.", "The resolution of this hypocrisy can come only from more explicit policies that address the nuances of patenting and licensing DNA inventions, and that accommodate the rights and interests of universities as users of patented inventions as well as holders of patent rights.", "The best hope is for a process in which the scientific and academic functions of academic research institutions find common ground with their business interests.", "The authors wish to thank several scholars who generously gave permission to use their data in this article, including Tim Caulfield, Tania Bubela and C. J. Murdoch of the University of Alberta, Michael Hopkins of the University of Sussex, Christopher Holman of the Law School for the University of Missouri, Kansas City, and LeRoy Walters and Mara Snyder of the DNA Patent Database, Georgetown University.", "Richard Gold and Julia Carbone were fully part of our research team, indeed our extended family, even before they became a family through matrimony.", "Our thanks go to the many students and colleagues, particularly those who contributed to genetic testing case studies (Subhashini Chandrasekharan, Misha Angrist, Alessa Colaianni, Katie Skeehan, Ashton Powell, Tamara James, Emily Pitlick, Christopher DeRienzo, Melissa Fiffer, and Christopher Conover).", "Geertrui van Overwalle and her colleagues at the University of Leuven contributed insights into diagnostic uses of gene patents from across the Atlantic.", "Daniel Kevles, Sally Smith Hughes, and Nicholas Rasmussen provided unpublished material.

Female CEOs earned slightly less, by about 9% on a median basis, although the small number of data points makes drawing conclusions difficult.", "Below, we lay out some of the top findings from our analysis. Our methodology is detailed in full at the bottom of this report.", "Rankings are listed first for the overall group of 194 companies, and then are segmented by company size: large pharma, biotechs worth more than $10 billion, between $2 billion and $10 billion, and between $500 million and $2 billion.", "Compensation includes base salary, cash bonuses and long-term stock and option awards, as described in annual proxy filings.", "| Company | CEO | Compensation, in $USD millions |", "| Company | CEO | Compensation, in $USD millions |", "| Company | CEO | Compensation, in $USD millions |", "| Company | CEO | Compensation, in $USD millions |", "| Company | CEO | Compensation, in $USD millions |", "| Company | CEO | Compensation, in $USD millions |", "| Company | CEO | Compensation, in $USD millions |", "CEOs in biotech and pharma earn sizable annual salaries, but it's stock and option grants that compose the bulk of total compensation.", "Like many corporations around the world, biotech and pharma chiefs typically also receive cash bonuses linked to their yearly performance — as defined by the company.", "Paying CEOs mostly via equity awards, the thinking goes, keeps the incentives of company executives in line with those of shareholders.", "Critics, though, argue the practice can spur short-term thinking, leading company chiefs to chase quarterly earnings numbers rather than long-term growth.", "Equity awards can vary greatly year to year. Sarepta Therapeutics' Douglas Ingram, for example, earned roughly $55 million more in 2017 than in 2018, thanks to $44 million in option grants that year.", "Compensation for MeiraGTx's Alexandria Forbes, meanwhile, swung from just over $1 million in 2017 to nearly $23 million last year.", "Valuing equity-based compensation is another question. For the purposes of regulatory reporting, companies determine an effective fair value for stock and option grants given to CEOs.", "That can differ — quite significantly — from what executives actually earn when they go to sell shares or exercise options, a sum generally referred to as annual realized gains.", "Regeneron's Leonard Schliefer, for example, was paid $26.5 million last year. But he also exercised options worth nearly $113 million.", "Like most other industries, biotech and pharma leadership skews heavily male. In 2018, more than 90% of CEOs were men.", "Just 16 of the 194 executives included in this analysis were female.", "Gender representation is even more lopsided among the largest companies. Across the 25 biggest pharma and biotech companies by value, GlaxoSmithKline's Emma Walmsley was the only woman.", "Compensation appeared broadly similar by median pay, although such comparison is hindered by a fewer number of data points for female CEO pay.", "Among the 15 female CEOs for whom numbers were available, the median woman made $5.2 million versus the $5.7 million earned by the median male, a difference of about 9%.", "It's worth noting, though, that Walmsley's pay of $7.8 million last year ranked 9th among the 14 pharma executives included in BioPharma Dive's analysis, and below the median sum for both the U.K. cross-industry and global pharmaceutical groups used by GSK as comparators.", "Most drugmakers reported CEO pay. Compensation for a handful of executives whose companies are listed abroad was not readily available.", "Among the 182 companies that did report, the median compensation was about $5.7 million. Averaged, that figure rose to just over $7.6 million.", "Fewer companies, 112, reported median employee pay. Using that dataset, the median figure for the group was $177,560, a rough estimate of what a typical worker in the biotech and pharma industry might make.", "Median pay numbers ranged from $38,661 to $804,000.", "Using those median figures for the group yields a CEO-to-employee pay ratio of roughly 32:1.", "The provision under the Dodd-Frank Act compelling companies to disclose median employee compensation and CEO pay ratios took effect for fiscal years beginning on or after Jan. 1, 2017, making 2018 the second year for which this data is available.", "While that doesn't provide much context, two data points allow for some comparison of change over time.", "BioPharma Dive found median CEO compensation — including equity awards — grew significantly faster than that of a median employee at small and medium-sized biotech companies.", "At large biotechs, median CEO and employee pay grew at roughly similar rates. In absolute terms, however, the typical executive earned more than $800,000 more in 2018 than in 2017, versus a boost of about $9,000 for the typical worker.", "The typical biopharma company saw its stock fall about 8% last year, but faltering market performance did not appear associated with lower executive compensation.", "Median pay for CEOs of companies which ended 2018 in the red, in fact, grew slightly more than for those who led drugmakers with positive stock returns last year.", "Among the 69 drugmaker stocks which grew in value year over year, the median executive compensation increased by 23%, versus the 27% bump to median pay among the 105 companies which posted declining share values.", "For what it's worth, employee pay moved in similar directions to stock performance: median compensation among companies in the green increased 6.1% while declining 4.6% for those in the red.", "Scrutiny of executive pay is commonplace regardless of sector, but in the drug industry it comes amid criticism over pharmaceutical pricing.", "Do pharma and biotech CEOs make more if they hike prices? It was a question asked by Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., at a hearing held by the powerful Senate Finance Committee in February, when top executives from seven drugmakers were called to testify on drug costs.", "Wyden's question was directed at Richard Gonzalez, the CEO of AbbVie, which makes the world's top-selling drug, Humira.", "AbbVie uses Humira sales as one factor in deciding the annual cash bonus for its top executives, which for Gonzalez totaled nearly $4 million last year.", "AbbVie's bonus framework is notable. Among the top 25 companies by value in BioPharma Dive's analysis with marketed products in the U.S., only six included sales of an individual product in their annual bonus calculations.", "Wyden's question also raises a wider one for the industry. Revenue targets are typically used in calculating executive compensation like cash bonuses.", "For many biotechs, though, revenue can be roughly that of one product's sales. AbbVie, for instance, derives three-fifths of its revenue from Humira, while the five others that included individual product sales targets in bonus calculations depended greatly on their respective top-sellers.", "Raising prices is a potent lever for boosting sales, so tying bonuses to revenue targets could in theory link compensation to prices for those companies with only one or few marketed products.", "In the case of Humira, AbbVie raised the drug’s list price by 9.7% in 2018 and by 6.2% in 2019 — increases that, while diminished by rebates and discounts, helped sales.", "In a written response to Wyden's question, AbbVie said no one factor determined more than 3% of Gonzalez's total compensation, of which his annual bonus made up 18%.", "Others are more explicit. Vertex earns much of its revenue from its three marketed cystic fibrosis drugs and includes a target for combined revenues in its annual bonus calculation.", "According to the company, though, such goals \"were not set, achieved through or dependent upon, price increases.\"", "BioPharma Dive merged and de-duplicated lists of holdings included in two biotech stock indices, the SPDR S&P Biotech ETF and iShares NASDAQ Biotechnology Index, to create a group of 238 biotech companies.", "We then added in biotech companies which had IPO'd in 2018 and are not yet included in either index (e.g. Moderna) to get a list of 265.", "Pharmaceutical companies, including those headquartered abroad, were included in a separate list of 14.", "Biotech companies with market capitalizations below $500 million as of May 20 were excluded from this analysis, reducing the biotech group to 180 companies.", "We did so to ensure we had a data set with companies in which median employee compensation would be based on a sufficient number of employees, and to create a more manageable data set.", "Smaller companies are also more likely to claim an exemption from reporting median employee compensation and CEO pay ratios.", "Market capitalizations were calculated using the Google Finance function or, when necessary, by multiplying the last disclosed number of outstanding common shares by closing prices on May 20.", "Employee compensation numbers and CEO pay ratios were not reported by all companies. Many that did not claimed \"Emerging Growth Company\" status, a reporting exemption under the Dodd-Frank Act.", "Employee numbers were tabulated from the latest relevant regulatory disclosure available, usually a Form 10-K.", "In some cases, reported CEO pay ratios were rounded to the nearest whole number.", "For growth in median compensation, BioPharma Dive segmented companies into large, mid-sized and small biotechs, excluding those lacking matched data (e.g. no 2017 numbers reported).", "We then calculated the median figures of each matched group for CEO and employee compensation, measuring percent and absolute change from 2017 to 2018.", "A public version of the database BioPharma Dive created can be found at this link.", "Large cap biotech: Market capitalization greater than $10 billion", "Mid-sized biotech: Market capitalization between $2 billion and $10 billion", "Small biotech: Market capitalization between $500 million and $2 billion", "CEO total compensation: The total figure reported on Summary Compensation Table in proxy or other filings.", "Inclusive of base salary, annual cash bonus, equity and option grants as well as miscellaneous payments within the 2018 calendar year.", "Median employee compensation: Employee compensation reported in the Dodd Frank Act-mandated CEO pay ratio section of company proxy filings.", "Inclusive of salary, 401(k) contributions and healthcare benefits.", "CEO pay ratio: A ratio of CEO total compensation to median employee compensation.

Repatha costs $14,100 and Praluent $14,600, respectively, for a year’s supply.", "To help control costs, Amgen agreed to provide Harvard Pilgrim with an enhanced discount if the reduction in LDL-C levels for the health plan’s members is less than that seen during clinical trials.", "The agreement also provides for additional discounts if utilization of the drug exceeds certain levels.", "The contract includes an “adherence” provision that conditions discounts on Harvard Pilgrim members taking the drug reliably.", "“With the cost of new specialty drugs skyrocketing, our arrangement with Amgen will help us contain premium costs for employers and members,” Harvard Pilgrim Chief Medical Officer Michael Sherman says.", "Health insurers in the U.S. and abroad have signed previous agreements with pharmaceutical manufacturers described as either “value-based” or “performance-based” that include a sharing of risk.", "For example, Merck agreed to provide discounts to Cigna if A1C lab values for Cigna’s insured population improved taking the Merck diabetes drugs sitagliptin (Januvia) and sitagliptin/metformin (Janumet).2 “We hope this agreement will become a model in the industry,” Eric Elliott, president of Cigna Pharmacy Management, said in 2009.", "However, the Harvard Pilgrim/Amgen agreement appears to be broader in a sense because it contains the potential “budget-based” discount.", "Januvia is not quite as expensive as Repatha and some new specialty drugs, such as Gilead Sciences’ hepatitis C medications sofosbuvir (Sovaldi) and sofosbuvir/ledipasvir (Harvoni).", "The website Good Rx lists the price for 30 Januvia 100-mg tablets at about $340 a month at numerous retail locations, or about $4,100 a year.", "No one knows what level of discount Cigna has received from Merck for Januvia.

Carlson, MPH, an Assistant Professor in the Pharmaceutical Outcomes Research and Policy Program at the University of Washington, participated in a webinar sponsored in November by the National Pharmaceutical Council (NPC), a research organization supported by large, research-intensive drug companies.", "The Cigna/Merck agreement on Januvia was discussed, but Carlson says neither has made data on the rebates available.", "Nor will Harvard Pilgrim disclose the price per month or year it is paying Amgen for Repatha or the level of the two prospective discounts.", "Joan Fallon, a Harvard Pilgrim spokeswoman, says the terms of the contract are confidential. She explains that the health plan will make the determination as to whether either of the two discounts are triggered.", "Whatever the final cost of Repatha to Harvard Pilgrim, it will obviously be the key to determining whether this is in fact a value-based contract.", "There is no guarantee that either of the two discount triggers will be reached, nor is it known how far below wholesale those discounts would drop Repatha’s price.", "“I’m guessing the discount was pretty modest off the top,” one industry expert speculates. “We’ll have to see what the performance part of the deal will actually yield beyond that.”", "That final price will decide how affordable the drug is and whether consumers, health experts, and others deem it a good value.", "The Institute for Clinical and Economic Review (ICER), an independent, nonprofit research group, published a draft report this fall stating that based on its value-based methodology (explained below), Repatha and Praluent should cost $2,177 a year.3 In a detailed statement, Amgen argued that ICER’s assumptions and methodology have “significant errors and deficiencies.”", "The final price to Harvard Pilgrim aside, the contract does adopt a value structure, and by doing so it may become a model for other pharmaceutical companies.", "Robert Dubois, the NPC’s Chief Science Officer, says the Harvard Pilgrim/Amgen contract has many attractive aspects.", "“From a pharmaceutical company’s perspective, the agreement meets many of the characteristics of what a successful risk-sharing structure would look like,” Dubois notes.", "Moreover, in a marketing sense, Amgen has given Repatha a way to distinguish itself from Praluent.", "These kinds of value-based deals will put new pressure on P&T committees. In the case of Repatha and Praluent, the issue of statin intolerance will come into play.", "Some people taking statins complain about lower-body aches and pains, which they attribute to the statin.", "That is often a misdiagnosis, but physicians may respond by switching the patient to another drug. A November 2015 Viewpoint article in the Journal of the American Medical Association stated:5", "The hypothesis that statin-associated adverse effects are due to statins is often not conclusively tested, because many patients stop statins or switch to other lipid-lowering agents.", "The usual approach to treat statin-associated adverse effects is to switch patients to a different statin, particularly to a low-dose (or every-other-day or once-a-week) statin associated with a lower incidence of the adverse effect.", "However, that usual approach is predicted to change. Clinicians who are treating patients experiencing statin-associated symptoms will likely switch to a PCSK9 inhibitor without trying statin challenge–rechallenge, de facto failing to test the hypothesis of a causal role of statins for the patients’ symptoms.", "Although it will be some time until the final cost of Repatha to Harvard Pilgrim becomes known, it is not too early to wonder whether the agreement provides encouragement to other manufacturers, health plans, and policy-makers.", "Drug prices show no signs of moderating.

In the case of Repatha, for example, a key issue is who is prescribed the drug and whether other statins are tried when the first statin prescribed doesn’t work, for whatever reason.", "That is a clinical issue, having more to do with the prescribing physician than the formulary. Moreover, P&T committees are not responsible for hammering out discounts for drugs.", "Dr. Thompson wonders whether hospitals have the same sway in that regard as large health plans and insurers, such as Harvard Pilgrim and Cigna.", "“There’s probably a leverage question here. Do most hospitals/systems or even GPOs [group purchasing organizations] have the leverage to push the pharma companies to think about pricing in a more value-based way?", "I’m guessing a system like the VA [Veterans Administration] probably comes closest to having that kind of clout and/or negotiating power.", "Some of the larger multihospital systems might be as well,” he explains.", "Insurers who do have the muscle to negotiate risk-sharing agreements with drug companies will likely look to the ICER draft analysis of “reasonable” costs for Repatha and Praluent, which uses a calculation that resembles in some ways the one advanced last year by the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO).", "It is based on a metric called quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). A QALY is a measure of disease burden, including both the quality and quantity of life lived.", "QALYs can provide an indication of the benefits obtained from medical procedures in terms of quality of life and survival.", "The QALY is often used in cost-effectiveness analyses to evaluate and compare the value of specific treatments for purposes of allocating resources across a health care system or systems.", "An intervention with a lower cost per QALY gained would be preferred over an intervention with a higher ratio.", "One can view the use of costs in action in the ICER draft reports on Repatha and Praluent.3 In their calculations, both ASCO, with its draft value framework, and the ICER look at the cost to buy the drug and the patient’s out-of-pocket expense.", "“Those two factors are fine,” explains Dan Ollendorf, ICER’s Chief Review Officer, “but they are not the entire picture.", "Our analysis goes beyond the ASCO approach by taking a broader perspective not just looking at how much it costs to use the drug, but also additional costs from side effects as well as other savings, such as reductions in the number of heart attacks and strokes in the case of PCSK9 inhibitors.”", "ASCO’s framework is in draft form, and the group won’t use it to determine what it thinks might be a fair price, as ICER has.", "Mary Rappaport, an ASCO spokeswoman, says the value framework will ultimately form the basis of tools that doctors can use in the clinical setting with their patients to help make treatment decisions.", "The framework is being developed by an ASCO Value in Cancer Care Task Force chaired by Lowell Schnipper, MD, Chief of the Division of Hematology and Oncology at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center.", "The task force expects to come up with values for the clinical benefit, toxicity, and cost of a treatment, and then assign it a value “score.”", "The idea, apparently, is to use oncologists as the fulcrum in a transaction that sees them pressing P&T committees at the hospitals where they work to adjust formularies to accommodate these scores.", "ASCO cites as the genesis of its efforts a 2013 article in the Journal of Clinical Oncology (JCO) entitled “Cancer drugs in the United States: Justum Pretium—the just price.”", "8 Aristotle is credited with being the first to discuss the relationship between price and worth in his book Justum Pretium, the just price.", "Among other things, the article cites an October 2012 New York Times opinion piece that relates how a hospital formulary dropped ziv-aflibercept (Zaltrap, Sanofi-Aventis) from its formulary after a value analysis found it cost twice as much as bevacizumab (Avastin, Genentech) but with no difference in efficacy between the two.", "Within a week, Sanofi-Aventis dropped the price of ziv-aflibercept by 50%. “Thus, expert review of anticancer therapies for their cost–benefit ratios may influence institutional usage and drug pricing while preserving a healthy profit margin for pharmaceutical companies,” the JCO article stated.", "While ASCO will not establish a “just” price for drugs, the ICER will. Its draft analysis determined that at their current prices of more than $14,000 a year, the cost per QALY gained for both Repatha and Praluent was about $300,000.", "“Our analyses suggested that, to meet commonly accepted thresholds of between $50,000 and $150,000 per QALY gained, the price would have to drop to between approximately $3,000 to $7,500 per year,” Ollendorf states.", "The closer the annual cost of a drug comes to the $50,000 figure, the tighter its cost–benefit ratio.", "The ICER said the price that best represents the overall benefits these drugs may bring to patients would be between $3,615 and $4,811, representing a 67% discount off the list price.", "But ICER advocated a second level of additional discount. “Even if these drugs were used in just over 25% of eligible patients, then employers, insurers, and patients would need to spend on average more than $20 billion a year for these drugs, a cost that would continue on into the future,“ says Dr. Pearson, ICER’s founder.", "The report concludes that it would take a further reduction to an annual drug cost of $2,177 for the total prices of these new drugs to reach a level at which doctors and insurers would not have to try to limit patient use in some way to keep overall health care cost growth within bounds.", "Dr. Pearson concludes, “Our draft report therefore suggests that $2,177 is the price that should serve as an alarm bell—if the cost is more than $2,177 a year, drug companies, doctors, insurers, and other parties may need to work together to determine ways to limit the use of these drugs, find savings in other parts of the health care system, or adopt other measures to help make these drugs more affordable.”", "Amgen takes issue with multiple aspects of the ICER analysis,4 most importantly its failure to take into account the impact of P&T committee utilization policies.", "Amgen argues the report for PCSK9 inhibitors performs a cost-effectiveness evaluation that models extensive product uptake by a population at lower risk than the FDA label and real-world adoption would suggest.", "ICER uses a figure of 10 million people a year taking Repatha. That would equate, at $14,600 a year, to a cost of $146 billion, which comes out to more than a third of the entire U.S. expenditure on all medications.", "Such estimates garner headlines, but they do not encourage a balanced discussion about value or result in patient-centered decision-making.", "The ICER analysis assumes a worst-case scenario where there is no utilization management. Since such controls are common for biologics, this starting place is disconnected from the reality of the U.S. health care system.", "Some people wonder whether frenzied efforts to lower specialty drug prices via value-based contracts are obfuscating a potentially more important challenge: reducing spending on clinical services that lack scientific evidence for improving individual or population health.", "Mark Fendrick, MD, Director of the Center for Value-Based Insurance Design (http://vbidcenter.org) and a Professor in the Departments of Internal Medicine and Health Management and Policy at the University of Michigan, explains that the federal government requires evidence from randomized controlled trials on safety and efficacy prior to approval only for the approximately 12% of U.S. health care costs accounted for by prescription drugs.", "“A similar evidentiary benchmark is not required for the entirety of the remaining 88% of spending, such as expenditures for clinician visits, laboratory tests, imaging, and surgical interventions,“ he states.", "Dr. Fendrick says that reducing utilization of costly medical services of low value, such as antibiotic therapy for viral respiratory illness and magnetic resonance imaging for people suffering from musculoskeletal back pain, would free up significant dollars that could be spent on services for which solid evidence of health benefits exists, such as guideline-recommended drug treatments that are systematically underused in many chronic conditions, including heart disease, depression, diabetes, and human immunodeficiency virus.", "Regardless of whether they are a small part of reducing high U.S. health care costs or a big part, value-based drug contracts will have to overcome some barriers before they are more widely used, not the least of them transparency.", "If no one knows how Cigna did in its agreement with Merck on Januvia, how can the utility of that contract be judged by third parties and altered, if necessary, to meet the needs of all the players in the game?", "Then there are the high administrative costs for such contracts that necessitate the development of reusable platforms, the difficulty of obtaining the necessary data (insurers generally have only claims data), and the need to involve physicians.", "These challenges are significant—but so is the opportunity.", "- 1.Harvard Pilgrim Health Care Harvard Pilgrim negotiates first-in-the nation innovative contract for blockbuster cholesterol drug Repatha.", "Nov 9, 2015.

The low success rates and the respective costs of failed drug projects are causal for the high out-of-the-pocket costs.", "In addition, the use of new technologies to reduce the timelines and to increase success rates in drug discovery, such as combinatorial chemistry, DNA sequencing, high-throughput-screening (HTS) or computational drug design, may have further increased R&D costs just as larger clinical trial sizes and better clinical infrastructure.", "Split to the phases of R&D, Paul et al. [12] reported that drug discovery and preclinical development account for 33 % of the total cost per NME (USD 281 million), clinical development (phase I to submission) represents 63 % (USD 548 million) and submission to launch costs 5 % (USD 44 million) of the overall expenditures per NME", "[12]. In view of the long time intervals, these out-of-the-pocket costs add together in extraordinary high capitalized costs of reported of USD 1.778 billion (2010) per NME [12, 19, 28].", "Such cost calculations do not include all expenditures associated directly and indirectly with drug R&D. Costs for basic research, phase IV trials, regulatory approvals in non-US markets or product life-cycle management need to be added.", "Exemplified by data from the 2014 CMR Factbook that 25.7 % of all costs of R&D are dedicated to the international roll-out and line extensions, the actual costs per new drug are higher than the analyzed USD 1.778 billion.", "Potentially, the results provided by Harper [30] illustrate the real costs, as he analyzed the expenditures per NME launched by leading pharmaceutical companies to be USD 3-12 billion.", "And he investigated that the top pharmaceutical companies, defined as those that have launched more than four NMEs between 2002–2011, invested more than USD 5 billion per new drug.", "The actual challenge for the pharmaceutical industry", "The actual challenge for the industry comes from putting the costs of pharmaceutical R&D in context to the output, namely the number of NMEs launched to the market.", "Scannell et al. [19] have analyzed the historical input/output-ratio of the pharmaceutical industry and concluded a bisection of the R&D efficiency every 9 years between 1950–2010 [19].", "Although todays output of some research-based pharmaceutical companies is remarkable, such as the 13 NMEs launched by Novartis in the period of 2006–2014, contrasting the output figures per company to their total R&D expenditure of up to USD 80 billion (2006–2014) highlights the real challenge the companies are facing (see Fig.", "1) . Although such analyses comprise inherent inaccuracies, such as the input parameter does not match time-wise with the output correctly, it still shows the dilemma of the pharmaceutical industry.", "In consequence and following the argumentation of Harper [30] the historical calculation of approximately USD 1 billion per approved drug needs to be corrected to an amount of more than USD 3 billion (see Table 1).", "In detail, Boehringer Ingelheim, Bristol-Myers Squibb, Takeda and GSK all spent USD 3–4 billion per NME, while Amgen, Novartis, AstraZeneca, Pfizer, Merck & Co., Sanofi and Roche each invested up to USD 8 billion per new drug approved by the FDA.", "And Eli Lilly and Abbott/AbbVie invested even more than USD 10 billion per NME (2006–2014)—an amount of money that at least for some pharmaceutical companies put a question mark on the sustainability of their R&D models.", "The reasons that have been discussed previously in the context of the high attrition rates and the interval durations also apply here.", "Further causes may have affected the R&D efficiency negatively, such as:", "an inadequate number of projects in early R&D phases [12],", "technically more complex research for new drug targets and subsequent preclinical and clinical studies [19],", "a higher burden for approval and reimbursement of NMEs in view of the already approved drugs,", "a lower risk tolerance of both regulators and society [19],", "the high number of mergers & acquisitions (M&As) [31–33, 35],", "the decreasing number of research-based pharmaceutical companies taking the financial risk of drug R&D [34] and", "a negative effect of licensing, co-development, or joint ventures on the clinical development and approval durations [35].", "Even though the reasons for the low R&D efficiency are known, a sector-wide general concept to solve this problem does not exist so far.", "Quite simply, the low R&D efficiency could be compensated by an increase in the financial value per NME launched.", "Thus, the 4 % of successful projects that result in new commercialized drugs have to provide enough revenue to justify the investment of the 96 % failed compounds and to provide enough profit for the investors.", "Consequently, commercializing more blockbuster drugs would compensate the low output and the increasing costs of pharmaceutical R&D.", "This rather traditional concept of the sector has resulted in an overall industry portfolio of 48 blockbuster drugs marketed in 2014 with some drugs such as Humira (USD 11.0 billion, 2013), Enbrel (USD 8.75 billion, 2013) or Advair (USD 8.3 billion, 2013) providing extraordinary high annual sales of more than USD 5 billion.", "It is however expected that average peak sales per NME will not achieve blockbuster dimensions, reflecting the increased challenges of offering benefits over already existing treatments [15].", "In the mature markets of Europe and the US, new products face stronger competition, need to be developed for better profiled patients populations, and are launched to smaller market segments which in turn reduces the market potential of the new drugs.", "At once, drugs face high cost pressure from the public and payers which affects the commercial potential negatively.", "For example, the public already discusses the justification for the prize of USD 84,000 per treatment regimen with Gilead’s blockbuster drug Solvadis for the treatment of Hepatitis C (http://www.wsj.com/articles/no-justification-for-solvadis-price-letters-to-the-editor-1409346750).", "For sure, some big pharmaceutical companies will be able to keep their R&D productivity high by investing in breakthrough innovation.", "The overall industry however, may not be able to compensate the reduced R&D efficiency solely by launching commercially high value (blockbuster) drugs.", "In contrast, the extraordinarily high R&D costs will make it for some pharmaceutical companies increasingly difficult to meet the investors’ expectations for a reasonable ROI exclusively from new products.", "The low R&D efficiency necessitates far reaching consequences for research-based pharmaceutical companies", "In the last years, more and more pharmaceutical companies realized that their low R&D efficiencies necessitate changes to their R&D ecosystems.", "In an analysis of major research-based pharmaceutical companies it was shown that 73 % of the investigated companies were making process changes in R&D [36], such as by (see Fig. 2):", "Improving R&D efficiency by restructuring R&D into better manageable smaller and biotechnology-like units [37, 38],", "Reducing R&D costs by benefiting from virtual R&D and increasingly using cost-efficient outsourcing,", "Widening the competence field by progressively expanding collaborations and research partnerships,", "Increasing the technology base by more and more accessing drug candidates in all phases from external sources,", "Strengthening the innovation potential by venture capital investments, and", "Today, all major research-based pharmaceutical companies use opportunities along the whole R&D value chain to access external innovation.", "While Novartis (https://external-novartis.idea-point.com/Default.aspx), Sanofi (http://en.sanofi.com/partners/being_our_partner/being_our_partner.aspx) and AstraZeneca (https://www.astrazeneca.com/our-science/partnering.html) use the potential of more traditional collaboration and partnering types (including corporate venture capital funds), other pharmaceutical companies have set-up alternative open innovation models ranging from innovation centers, crowdsourcing, open source innovation to virtual R&D.", "Traditionally, the pharmaceutical industry has collaborated with third parties to access specialty know-how [39].", "As the complexity of pharmaceutical R&D increased fundamentally, nowadays collaborations are more and more used to get access to the required enlarged set of skills and technologies, such as novel drug targets, validation of targets, signal transduction pathway know-how, animal models, disease expertise, translational medicine know-how and biomarkers.", "As for example, GSK is spending nearly half of its R&D budgets to collaboration partners from academia or the biotechnology industry [40].", "In this context, it has established Discovery Partnerships with Academia (DPAc), an alliance program starting from early screening to late optimization in any disease area and any treatment modality.", "While the academic collaboration partner can profit from GSK’s know-how in drug discovery and from its resources in medicinal chemistry, preclinical safety and pharmacokinetics, GSK can access ideas from academia to boost its innovation potential (http://www.dpac.gsk.com).", "In some areas of research, pharmaceutical companies have even broke new grounds by moving their proprietary technologies, such as HTS, to a larger number of external academic and institutional laboratories to increase flexibility and to benefit from governmental funding [41].", "According to Frye [42], 78 academic screening centers focusing on high-risk drug targets were started in the USA till 2010.", "In Germany, the Lead Discovery Center (LDC) has been established in 2008 by the technology transfer organization Max-Planck-Innovation (MPI).", "The LDC aims at building a translational bridge between the excellence and know-how in basic research of Max-Planck scientists and applied pharmaceutical research, as for example by offering HTS technologies (http://www.lead-discovery.de/en/).", "Merck & Co. have started to launch in-depth academic partnerships with universities and academic institutes, such s the California Institute for Biomedical Research (Calibr), to translate academic basic research into new drugs (http://www.merck.com/licensing/partnership_success/academic_partnerships.html).", "Next, numerous pharmaceutical companies have closed their traditional R&D sites and opened new ones in close location with world-class academic institutions to better profit from their excellences and competences.", "As for example, Pfizer opened a new research site in Cambridge, Massachusetts, in 2014, after closing several sites following the merger with Wyeth (http://www.pfizer.com/research/science_and_technology/rd_locations/ma_cambridge).", "The new facility brings together around 1000 employees from Pfizer in one of the most well-known science hubs with famous universities, such as the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) or Harvard University, and more than 150 companies of the biopharmaceutical/biotechnology sector, amongst others Eli Lilly, Millennium (Takeda), AstraZeneca, Sanofi, GSK and Novartis (https://data.cambridgema.gov/Planning/Life-Sciences-and-Technology-Listing/fv53-bvhy).", "Also the academic partners profit from the close collaborations with pharmaceutical companies, as for example the Havard’s Office of Technology Development estimated that 4–5 % of its funding comes from industry collaborations [43].", "In sum, collaborations (in different forms) between pharmaceutical companies and academic institutions/biotechnology companies are the norm today, building complex collaboration networks with pharmaceutical companies being the nodes of the networks [42, 44].", "Since the financial crisis of 2007, M&As have become increasingly important in the biopharmaceutical sector.", "Pharmaceutical companies use M&As to compensate revenue losses of blockbuster patent expirations, to access strategically important intellectual property (IP), to exploit technology-based treatment innovations, to develop new core competencies, or to fill R&D pipeline gaps.", "Most of the research-based pharmaceutical companies widened the breadth of their portfolio by accessing research projects and drug candidates from external sources to supplement their in-house pipeline and to meet at least part of their growth objectives by product innovation.", "Today, 50 % of the R&D pipelines of multinational pharmaceutical companies come from external sources [44].", "Another approach to increase R&D efficiency is a greater focus on portfolio management and, thus, on project-related costs and project ROI.", "For example, DiMasi et al. reported a decrease in the average time from start of a research project to its abandonment in clinical trials by 30 % from 4.7 years to 3.3 years, indicating a trend towards earlier decision-making which reduces R&D costs as drug candidates fail earlier and cheaper [35].", "According to the principles of modern value-based portfolio management, a portfolio of projects must be large enough to compensate project failures in drug discovery and development.", "While individual projects fail because of technical, commercial or market risks, the rest of the drug project portfolio must to be robust enough to provide the ROI expected by investors.", "The bigger the project portfolio the easier drug project failures can be compensated. As a consequence, the individual pipeline size of pharmaceutical companies increased in the past years [45].", "Today, the corporate R&D pipelines of the top companies include more than 150 drug projects in development phases, with GSK (261), Roche (248), Novartis (223), and Pfizer (205) having 200 and more drug projects in their portfolio [45].", "Some pharmaceutical companies analyzed the saving potential of R&D and cut their units to increase their R&D efficiencies.", "Principally, a reduction in R&D costs is combined with a release of R&D personnel and outsourcing of R&D activities to service providers in low-cost countries to reduce operational and infrastructure costs.", "GSK announced in 2012 to realize annual savings of GBP 1 billion by 2016 by reducing the size of its R&D and manufacturing organizations (http://www.pharmatimes.com/article/13-02-07/GSK_puts_faith_in_pipeline_and_cuts_costs_after_tough_2012.aspx).", "Merck & Co. published to reduce its R&D, manufacturing and administration staff by 8.500 people which should result in a USD 1.25 billion cost saving (http://www.fiercepharma.com/story/skinny-earnings-cost-cuts-boost-merck-bristol-myers-forest-fx-hits-sanofi/2014-04-29).", "Takeda’s new CEO, Christophe Weber, aims to reduce the R&D costs by specialization and focus on therapeutic areas where Takeda has a leading position (http://www.fiercebiotech.com/story/takeda-preps-stringent-rd-new-boss-takes-reins/2014-08-05).", "The change is in line with its USD 1 billion cost cutting program (http://www.fiercepharma.com/story/takedas-new-outsider-cfo-charged-1b-cost-cutting-plan/2013-11-18).", "Pfizer has been very active in reducing its costs after executing two major mergers since 2003, when more than 50,000 employees lost theirs jobs (http://www.fiercepharma.com/story/pfizers-post-megamerger-cost-cutting-record-51500-jobs-7-years/2014-04-29) and annual R&D expenditures were reduced from USD 9.4 billion (2010) to USD 6.7 billion (2013).", "Today, outsourcing and collaborations with service providers are a standard in the pharmaceutical sector.", "Outsourcing companies are providing services along the whole value chain from research to development, marketing and manufacturing [46–48].", "The global drug discovery outsourcing market was USD 14.9 billion (2014) and is expected to reach USD 25 billion by 2018", "[49], while the market for CRO-conducted clinical trials was USD 23.1 billion (2014) and is expected to increase to USD 35.8 billion by 2020 (http://www.pharmsource.com/market/how-big-is-the-market-for/).", "What has been outsourcing on demand with many external service providers and redundant internal functions will become an integrated model of outsourcing with a limited number of strategic partners and long-term relationships", "The industry has also realized that innovation centers may be a driving force for creativity and innovation, a smart way to bring together company-internal and external experts and to integrate internal and external know-how to solve R&D challenges.", "As for example, GSK launched in 2007 its Center of Excellence for External Drug Discovery (CEEDD), an externally focused R&D center that facilitates drug discovery alliances up to clinical proof-of-concept (PoC) with external partners working across all therapeutic areas (http://www.out-sourcing-pharma.com/Preclinical-Research/GSK-opens-Centre-of-Excellence).", "It combines the model of a biotech alliance with the principles of a virtual organization and it provides diversity through externalization.", "CEEDD’s partners bring in their technologies and drug compounds while GSK is providing drug discovery and development expertise and services.", "If the drug candidate is showing proof-of-concept in clinical development, GSK is seeking a worldwide license for full development and commercialization.", "GSK’s external drug discovery activities are supported by the in-house scientific consultancy Scinovo that manages the interface of external partners and internal scientists (http://www.gsk.com/en-gb/business-to-business/discovery-and-development-consulting/).", "Till today, CEEDD helped to fill GSK’s early stage pipeline that consists now to 50 % of externally sourced projects (http://www.glaxosmithkline.at/common/pdf/130311_GSK-auf-der-Life-Science-Success_2013.pdf).", "Pfizer established the Global Centers for Therapeutic Innovation (CTIs) in 2010, an open innovation model that aims at founding global partnerships between Pfizer and academic medical centers (http://www.pfizer.com/research/rd_works/centers_for_therapeutic_in-novation.jsp).", "While Pfizer is providing financial funding, human resources and technologies, the academic partners bring in their hypotheses of new drug mechanisms.", "Decision-making is done in joint steering committees.

Manufacturers have higher gross profit margins for branded drugs and intermediaries have higher gross profit margins for generic drugs.", "Gross margins on generic drugs are lower for manufacturers (50%), and much higher for pharmacies (43%).", "More than $1 in every $5 in spending on prescription drugs goes towards profits of firms in the pharmaceutical distribution system.", "While the current analysis cannot say definitively whether any sectors make excessive profits, greater scrutiny of pricing policies of each sector and more competition throughout the distribution system is warranted.", "Prescription drugs sold in retail pharmacies accounted for almost $325 billion or 10% of total healthcare costs in 2015, up 9% from 2014.1 Such dramatic growth has prompted calls for government intervention to regulate drug prices or otherwise control their rapid increase.2", "But any intervention should be predicated on a clear understanding of the economic forces that drive price increases, and the parties responsible for them.", "Much attention has focused on the average wholesale or “list” price set by manufacturers prior to discounts.", "These prices have been increasing—the average list price of branded drugs rose 12.4% in 2015, and has increased 10% or more annually since 2012.3 Yet list prices rarely represent what manufacturers are paid for drugs, as they are routinely discounted and rebates paid to various parties in the distribution system.", "Net prices—which include all discounts and rebates—have also risen, albeit more slowly to 2.8% in 2015.3 Yet even the net price that manufacturers receive does not fully represent what patients pay (through a combination of out-of-pocket payments and insurer reimbursements).", "The difference between what patients pay and what manufacturers receive is allocated among other stakeholders in the drug distribution chain, including insurers, pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs), pharmacies, and wholesalers.", "Contracts among these players govern the exchange of goods (drugs) or services (such as logistics or claims administration) for various fees, discounts, rebates, and chargebacks.", "Such arrangements are typically privately negotiated and undisclosed, making it difficult to determine precisely how these payments are distributed.", "However, publicly traded companies in the distribution system must disclose annual financial information to the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and other regulatory agencies, and from those data we can examine the flow of funds from the insurer back to the manufacturer, and the relative profitability at each step.", "The results illuminate opportunities to reduce total drug spending.", "We estimated the flow of funds in the distribution system by first developing a conceptual framework to illustrate the flow of goods, services, and funds among system participants.", "Next, we used data from financial statements, regulatory filings and other sources to estimate the average gross and net profit margins of companies along the distribution system.", "We applied these estimates to calculate the proportion of funds retained at each step in the process, and used them to illustrate how $100 in retail prescription drug expenditures is allocated across players in the distribution system.", "Using information from four published sources, we developed a conceptual framework of pharmaceuticals distributed in retail settings, illustrated in Figure 1.4-7", "Beneficiaries and sponsors pay premiums to a health plan, in exchange for drug coverage benefits for plan members.", "The health plan or self-insured employer contracts with a PBM to manage the plan’s drug benefit in exchange for fees and payments.", "The PBM negotiates with drug manufacturers to provide preferred formulary placement for the manufacturers’ products, in exchange for discounts from list price, rebates, incentives and other fees payable to the PBM.", "The PBM also negotiates contracts with pharmacies, including those in its network, to set reimbursements for the drugs dispensed by the pharmacy.", "Pharmacies in turn negotiate agreements with drug wholesalers, setting the wholesale rates at which they obtain the drugs, and wholesalers negotiate to buy drugs from manufacturers and distribute them to pharmacies.", "When a covered beneficiary fills a prescription at a retail pharmacy, the pharmacy collects the beneficiary’s copayment or coinsurance and dispenses the drug from inventory.", "The pharmacy passes the copayment to the PBM, and the PBM pays the pharmacy the negotiated reimbursement.", "To re-stock inventory, the pharmacy purchases drugs from the wholesaler, who purchases them from the manufacturers.", "Periodically (e.g. quarterly), the PBM reconciles drug claims and the manufacturer pays the PBM any rebates, incentive payments or fees owed based on their negotiated contracts.", "The PBM may pass some of these funds on to the plan sponsors, according to the contracts negotiated with each plan.", "We collected data on the largest public companies for each sector described in Figure 1: insurers, PBMs, pharmacies, wholesalers and manufacturers.", "We used public sources to identify the largest publicly traded companies in each sector until at least half of the total market was represented.3,8-13 For health insurers, our sample only accounts for 48% of the premiums written, because many large insurers are private, not for profit, or mutual.", "Table 1 lists the included companies and their respective market shares.", "Our objective was to estimate average gross and net profit margins for each sector in the distribution system described in Figure 1, and use them to calculate the proportion of the aggregate flow of funds captured by each sector.", "In this distribution system, each sector supplies goods or services to customers in exchange for payment (revenue).", "Some of that revenue is in turn passed from the original supplier to the next player in the chain, as payment for the raw goods and services needed to produce the product, called “cost of goods sold.”", "The remaining funds, or gross profit, are captured in the sector, and may be used in several ways, including to fund research and development (R&D), marketing, general and administrative activities (SG&A), or provide a return to owners (net earnings or profits).", "A company’s gross profits are the difference between revenues received and costs of goods sold; gross margin is this amount expressed as a percent of revenues.", "For example, gross profits for wholesalers are revenues received primarily from pharmacies less payments made primarily to manufacturers.", "Some of these gross profits are spent on other business expenses such as marketing, R&D, depreciation, interest, and taxes.", "What remains after subtracting these expenses is net profits, which accrue to the shareholder owners of the firm.", "We estimated gross and net margins as a fraction of net revenues for all companies using information from their 2015 SEC filings (forms 10K and 20F).", "To the extent that SEC filings allowed, we isolated financial data for US pharmaceutical operations and for the sector of interest.", "For example, for a company with both specialty pharmacy and PBM divisions that report separate financial results for each, we used PBM division data to estimate margins for the PBM business.", "In some cases, it was not possible to isolate the results of pharmaceutical business activities—for example, health insurers do not report financial results for their pharmaceutical claims activity separate from medical claims activity.", "In these cases, our margin estimates include activities of other types of business. When data did not permit a US-specific margin to be calculated, we used the global margin.", "We also calculated separate gross margins for branded and generic drugs for each sector. For manufacturers, we categorized each company as either a branded or generic producer, and calculated separate gross and net margins for each.13 For pharmacies, we used the National Average Drug Acquisition Cost (NADAC) and the National Average Retail Price (NARP) datasets from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) for 2013, and calculated gross margins as described in Appendix Section B, analyzing generic and branded subsamples separately.", "The SEC filings of wholesalers and insurers do not report results of generic and branded activity separately, so we could not estimate drug-type specific margins for them.", "Instead, we used other published estimates of gross margins specific to brand and generic drugs.14,15", "To illustrate the implications of our estimates, we explore a hypothetical scenario in which $100 is spent on prescription drugs acquired at a retail pharmacy using commercial insurance.", "We apply the average sector gross margins to the incoming funds to each sector to identify how much is retained in each sector, and apply the average sector net margins to identify the funds that are kept as net profits.", "This process was applied throughout the distribution system, as detailed in Section D of the Appendix.", "The funds passed through the last step are assumed to be production costs to manufacture the drugs.", "The first step in the chain requires further explanation. Of a $100 expenditure on prescription drugs obtained at a retail pharmacy, some portion is paid out-of-pocket by the patient, in the form of copayments and co-insurance, and goes directly to the PBM.d", "The remaining funds originate with the insurer as premium revenue, and the insurer’s gross margin is applied to this amount, rather than the full $100, to calculate the amount retained in the insurance sector.", "The proportion of total drug expenditures originating as premiums was estimated using data from the 2014 Medical Expenditure Panel Survey (MEPS), which provides annual total prescription drug expenditures and out-of-pocket payments (see Appendix Section C for detail).", "For all other sectors, all funds flowing into the sector are assumed to come directly from the sector immediately upstream—that is, all manufacturers’ revenue is passed through from wholesalers, all wholesalers’ revenue is passed through from pharmacies, etc.", "Finally, we compare the average net margins estimated for pharmaceutical distribution system participants to the average net margins of public companies in similar industries, which are published annually.16 Drug manufacturers are compared to other consumer and business product manufacturers, drug wholesalers are compared to food wholesalers, health insurers to other types of insurance companies, and pharmacies to other retail businesses.", "PBMs are compared to the category of real estate operations and services, which includes real estate agents and brokers, who also negotiate and act as intermediaries in transactions between third parties.", "Average US sales-weighted gross and net margins for each sector in the distribution system are reported in Table 2, as are gross margins for the branded and generic markets separately.", "For all drugs combined, gross margins are highest for manufacturers at 71.1%, followed by insurers (22.2%), pharmacies (20.1%), PBMs (6.3%) and wholesalers (3.7%).", "Net margins are significantly lower for all parties, ranging from 26.3% for manufacturers to 0.5% for wholesalers.", "In the branded market, gross margins are higher for manufacturers (76.3%) and lower for the other distribution system parties (except for insurers, for whom drug-type-specific margins could not be estimated), while in the generic drug market, the opposite is true: margins are lower for manufacturers (49.8%), and higher for all other distribution system participants (again, excepting insurers), including pharmacies, with generic gross margins of 42.7%.", "Net margins by drug type are only available for manufacturers, falling significantly below their gross margins, at 28.1% for brand drugs and 18.2% for generics.", "Figure 2 applies the gross and net margin estimates in Table 2 to illustrate the average flows of funds to distribution system participants for branded and generic drugs combined Of a $100 expenditure on pharmaceuticals by consumers (composed of both out-of-pocket and insurer payment), roughly $17 goes to drug production costs, $41 accrues to the manufacturers (a third of which is net profit), and $19 accrues to insurers ($3 of which is net profit).", "PBMs keep about $5 ($2 net profit), pharmacies keep $15 ($3 net profit), and wholesalers keep about $2 (30 cents net profit).", "Total net profit on a $100 expenditure is $23, of which $15 is captured by manufacturers and the remaining $8 by intermediaries.", "Figure 3 shows the results of similar analyses conducted separately for branded (Panel A) and generic (Panel B) drugs, and demonstrates important differences in how funds accrue to distribution system players across these market segments.", "While manufacturers make about three times the gross profits on branded vs. generic drugs ($58 vs. $18, consistent with the market exclusivity granted to patented drugs), other segments make much more on generic expenditures: PBMs make four times as much on generic drugs compared to brands, while wholesalers make eleven times as much, and pharmacies almost twelve times as much, $32 compared to $3.", "Figure 4 compares the net margins for players in the pharmaceutical distribution system to those in similar industries, based on published estimates of average net margins for 100+ industries.16 Drug manufacturers and pharmacies had higher margins than most comparator industries.", "Margins for all participants were validated with previously published estimates whenever possible. See Appendix Section B for more details.", "Given large and increasing expenditures for pharmaceutical drugs in the US, an understanding of who profits from this spending—and by how much—is of great policy salience.", "Identifying these flows is challenging because available data are highly aggregated and permit only a high-level view of a complex distribution system.", "Despite these limitations, we argue the aggregate picture can illuminate features of the distribution system and guide further inquiry.", "We demonstrate that gross and net margins vary widely across distribution sectors, prompting the question whether companies are making excessive returns.", "Market concentration is an important indicator of companies’ ability to earn extraordinary returns, and several segments in the US pharmaceutical distribution system are highly concentrated.", "The top three PBMs, wholesalers and retailers account for 85%, 66% and 49% of their markets, respectively.", "Barriers to entry are another source of market power, and Joseph Stiglitz has argued that “[t]oday’s markets are characterized by the persistence of high monopoly profits,” citing pharmaceutical manufacturing as one example.17", "This market power manifests in practices that might raise consumer prices. For example, pharmacies charge widely varying prices for exactly the same product, and the uninsured often pay higher prices than insured consumers.18 Some players claim market concentration is good for consumers.", "For example, PBMs argue that their large size gives them bargaining power to negotiate lower prices for their clients.19,20 Less clear is the extent to which these savings are passed on to health plans and consumers.", "PBMs carefully guard information about the size of negotiated rebates and discounts, which may enhance their ability to negotiate lower prices, but also masks whether they are indeed lowering the prices paid by patients and insurers as claimed.", "In fact, recently proposed legislation intended to lower drug prices would require PBMs to disclose rebates and the share passed on to health plans.21", "While the market for manufacturers is less concentrated, patents and market exclusivity for many products confer a complete monopoly for those drugs.", "Brand manufacturers’ net profit margins fall at the upper end of the distribution for manufacturing industries, suggesting excessive returns.", "Estimated net margins for the other distribution system segments except pharmacies are comparable to those of similar non-pharma industries.", "However, returns for manufacturers, particularly branded drugs, must compensate for the risk taken in drug development.", "Other manufacturing industries where intellectual property protections are important, including software, semiconductors, and computer equipment also demonstrate higher margins.", "Nonetheless, manufacturers also engage in some questionable practices. Manufacturers of branded drugs facing competition from new generic entrants may fund copay assistance programs that reduce patients’ out-of-pocket costs, dissuading them from switching to cheaper generics and circumventing insurer formularies designed to encourage such switching.22 Manufacturers have also been scrutinized for off-label promotion of drugs and anticompetitive pricing practices, including the ongoing investigation surrounding rising insulin prices.23", "Finally, insurer practices also have competing effects on consumer drug costs. On one hand, they exert downward pressure on prices when they place the products of manufacturers who refuse to lower prices in higher cost-sharing or copayment tiers.", "But the resulting high out-of-pocket costs burden consumers who need these expensive drugs, and lower adherence.", "The practice also doubly penalizes those who do not respond to less expensive therapies.24", "Sometimes consumers pay more for a prescription than the insurer’s cost of acquiring the drug—a common experience in high deductible health plans.", "Members who have not exhausted their deductible pay out-of-pocket the full average wholesale 8 price for drugs, although the plan acquires them at a discount and collects the associated manufacturer rebate.25 For generic drugs, consumers’ copays may exceed the cost of the drug.", "By contrast, patients would not likely tolerate paying an office visit copayment that exceeded their physician’s reimbursement.", "In summary, we find that more than $1 in every $5 in spending on prescription drugs goes towards profits of firms in the pharmaceutical distribution system.", "While the current analysis cannot say definitively whether any sectors are making excessive profits, our results are consistent with profit-making behavior on the part of all sectors.", "Greater scrutiny of their pricing policies and more competition throughout the distribution system is warranted.", "The question of what drives high intermediary profits on generic products is especially interesting.", "This work has several limitations, many resulting from data shortcomings. Key data are not always publicly available, and even the data presented in financial statements may be reported in inconsistent and opaque ways.26 Some of the largest players in certain sectors are privately held and make no financial data public.", "Thus, all our estimates are to some extent incomplete and inexact.", "Also, this analysis shows an aggregated picture of the retail pharmaceutical distribution system. It does not represent the flow of funds for any particular drug or firm, and indeed, those pictures may vary across settings and from that presented here.", "An important category that is not well characterized here is that of specialty drugs, such as biologics for rheumatoid arthritis or expensive HIV therapies.", "Some manufacturer and insurer margin estimates here may include specialty drugs, but they are generally not distributed through retail pharmacies.", "Instead, they are handled through specialty pharmacies, the largest of which are owned by PBMs. Physician administered specialty drugs often add another player to the distribution system, the group purchasing organization, which negotiates on behalf of hospitals and physicians for volume discounts.", "Any policy effort to control drug prices through regulation or other means would benefit from greater transparency and granularity in reporting of each sector’s financials, which is required to fully understand the dynamics in specific market segments.", "In this regard, recent initiatives by several pharmaceutical manufacturers to provide more price transparency are welcome.27-29 In any case, efforts to control drug costs should focus on the rents enjoyed by all players in the distribution system.", "Support for this project was provided by the Schaeffer Center for Health Policy & Economics and by Amgen through a contract with Precision Health Economics.", "The views expressed herein are those of the authors and do not represent the views of the funders, and the sponsors had no role in the research.", "Goldman is a co-founder of Precision Health Economics and holds equity in its parent company.

We need to work with jurisdictions, governments, and payors to find a way to bring innovation that makes a difference to the people who need it.", "McKinsey: How do you respond to these trends in a way that differentiates you from the crowd?", "Esteban Santos: Amgen was founded on the belief that innovation brings value to society.

To retain that advantage and advance our capabilities, we focus on reliability, efficiency, agility, and differentiation.", "Reliable supply—getting medicines to patients in an ever more complex world—has long been a strength for Amgen.", "That was a differentiator in the early days of biotech; today it’s just the entry ticket.", "The next element is to keep finding ways to be more efficient and productive. How do we eliminate work that doesn’t add value and redeploy people and capital to fund the R&D machine and commercial expansion?", "Reliability and efficiency remain important, but they are no longer sufficient to ensure our success.", "We also have to become more agile in how we deliver our products and services.

Exelixis initially pursued cabozantinib for medullary thyroid cancer, an indication that received FDA approval in 2012.", "Market share for this rare malignant tumor is limited, and the company simultaneously pursued the drug for other indications, including prostate cancer.25 However, highly promising phase 2 results in that cancer25 failed to be corroborated in phase 3,26 after which the company laid off 70% of its staff.27 However, despite these setbacks, Exelixis still retains 9 years of exclusivity for cabozantinib and has expanded approved indications to include renal cancer.", "In time, the company is ensured a profit. Together, these 3 cases are illustrative of the diverse paths and setbacks companies face in the road to drug approval, but, despite the challenges, all demonstrate high profitability.", "Our analysis has several strengths. By focusing solely on companies that have brought a single drug to market, we were able to sum R&D filings that led to a single approval.", "As indicated in the Table, all these companies were pursuing several drugs. Thus, our analysis includes the cost of pursuing a portfolio of candidate compounds to yield one drug (ie, considers the cost of development failure).", "There are critical limitations to our work. First, our data set is small, containing approximately 15% of all new molecular entities approved for cancer during this time.", "To take advantage of the unique sample of the drug market, we limited our study to companies that were pursuing their first approval.", "This method removed R&D costs used to bolster the sales of prior approved products but necessarily limited our sample size.", "Second, although we used SEC filings, which are subject to strict guidelines and regulation, it is possible that some companies overemphasized or underemphasized R&D costs through unintentional errors.", "Without access to primary company data, we cannot be sure. Third, our analysis pertains only to cancer drugs, which have had a steady pace of drug approvals in recent years, and cannot be extrapolated to other sectors in which drug development may be harder for biological reasons (eg, Alzheimer disease).", "Furthermore, cancer medications are costly, and revenue cannot be extrapolated to other sectors. Fourth, R&D spending permits firms to obtain various tax breaks, which can subsidize expenses by up to 15%, and these are not accounted for in our analysis.", "Nevertheless, despite these limits, our analysis provides important information for this ongoing discussion.", "Ultimately, the greatest limitation to our analysis is one shared by all the prior analyses6,8 we have discussed: we still lack total R&D transparency.", "The cost to develop a drug is a measurable concept, and with open access to pharmaceutical company records, it can be done with some precision.", "We favor an analysis of the question that brings all stakeholders together to produce a precise, transparent estimate to inform policy.", "Prior estimates for the cost to develop one new drug span from $320.0 million to $2.7 billion.

pharmaceutical companies make certain modifications to a drug such as changing its35 chemical composition slightly or making an external change as minor as adding a stripe to a pill36 in order to preserve their patents.", "A 2018 study in the Journal of Law and the Biosciences found that 78 percent37 of new drug patents awarded in the past decade went to drugs that already existed.", "Seventy percent 38 of the nearly 100 bestselling drugs extended their exclusivity protections at least once, and 50 percent extended their patents more than once.", "The second tactic—thicketing—involves flooding the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office and the courts with excessive patents and applications to make it difficult for competing firms to secure patents.", "These tactics help preserve pharmaceutical companies’ monopolies and ensure that drug prices remain uncompetitive and thus less affordable for everyday Americans.", "While consumers continue to pay the price of this market manipulation, a Government Accountability Office (GAO) report on the pharmaceutical industry found that these unfair practices are significantly enriching manufacturers.", "As the report stated, “Among the largest 25 companies, annual average profit margin fluctuated between 15 and 20 percent.”39", "The GAO contextualizes these profits by comparing the pharmaceutical industry’s profits with those of its counterparts, stating that “the annual average profit margin across non-drug companies among the largest 500 globally fluctuated between 4 and 9 percent.”", "In 2018 alone, the CEOs of major pharmaceutical companies Allergan, Johnson & Johnson, and Pfizer Inc. made a total of $90 million.40 Meanwhile, according to a CBS News report, Americans spent $535 billion41 on prescription drugs in 2018—an increase of 50 percent since 2010.42 As pharmaceutical industry profits increase43, everyday Americans—whose tax dollars play a critical role in funding the research and development of these medications—are not receiving anything close to a fair return on their investment.", "A recent Pew Charitable Trusts study found that Americans spent $65.8 billion44 out of pocket in 2016 for retail prescription drugs, up from $59.5 billion in 2012.", "The high cost of prescription drugs is a significant driver of medical debt45 because Americans are increasingly reliant on medication to manage long-term chronic conditions.46 Additionally, the high cost of prescription drugs has forced many Americans to take drastic measures, including foregoing taking their medications as prescribed or traveling abroad in order to save on medications.", "A 2019 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention study found that 11.4 percent47 of adults aged 18 to 64 did not take their prescription drugs as prescribed in order to reduce how much they spent on their medications.", "And, as NPR recently reported, “The U.S government estimates that close to 1 million48 Americans in California alone go to Mexico annually for health care, including to buy prescription drugs.”", "In May 2019, a group of Americans49 living with Type 1 diabetes traveled to Canada to purchase insulin and call on the U.S. government to regulate the cost of lifesaving drugs.", "The costs associated with traveling abroad make it logistically and financially impractical for most Americans.", "Further, traveling abroad presents certain health risks given that some countries have lax drug certification standards compared with FDA standards.", "In an interview with Time magazine ahead of being chosen as its Person of the Year in 2016, Trump said, “I’m going to bring down drug prices.", "I don’t like what’s happened with drug prices. ”50 He promised to bring Americans’ drug spending down to $0 by negotiating drug prices.51 Trump made grandiose promises on drug pricing but almost three years later has only managed to deliver a handful of half-measures, illustrating his administration’s lack of commitment to lowering drug prices.", "One of Trump’s proposals from his so-called presidential blueprint52 included eliminating some rebates paid by drug companies53 that hide the true cost of drugs.", "However, the Congressional Budget Office estimated that the measure would actually increase federal spending on Medicare and Medicaid by $177 billion.54 The Trump administration also announced a regulation that would require TV ads for drugs to include the list price.55 Some experts believe this policy will be ineffective56 at making pharmaceutical companies lower list prices or end price hikes for drugs and will only confuse or mislead consumers rather than help them.57 These half-measures, combined with Trump surrounding himself with high-level Big Pharma officials, clearly communicates that the administration is not on track to lower drug costs for Americans.", "Congress has done little to address the problem of high drug prices. Instead, many members continue to enjoy cozy relationships with the pharmaceutical industry.", "The industry spent more than $62 million in the 2016 congressional elections—the most it has ever spent on political campaigns.58 The massive influx of campaign cash benefited members of both parties, including those that sit on committees with jurisdiction over drug pricing.59 Big Pharma’s investment has paid off as recently as July 2019, when the Senate Finance Committee failed to pass an amendment on the Prescription Drug Pricing Reduction Act of 2019, which would have allowed Medicare to negotiate drug prices with manufacturers.60 Medicare’s ability to negotiate on drug prices, which is currently prohibited by law, “would provide the leverage needed to lower drug costs.”61", "Despite his promise to be tough on Big Pharma, President Trump has proven to be a friend to the industry.", "Big Pharma officials have filled at least 1662 current or former positions in the Trump administration, and many of Trump’s top health advisers have been industry insiders or close to the pharmaceutical companies.", "Trump’s first secretary of health and human services, former Rep. Tom Price (R-GA), was a longtime friend of the industry63 in Congress, where he not only pushed Big Pharma’s agenda but also benefited from it financially.64 Price, who drew scrutiny for more than $300,000 in health care stock trades, was eventually forced to resign in 201765 as a result of his illicit use of private jets on the taxpayers’ dime.", "In 2017, Trump nominated Joe Grogan66 to a top position at the U.S. Office of Management and Budget. Grogan spent five years as a lobbyist for Gilead—the pharmaceutical company that is infamous for its sky-high prices on a cure for hepatitis C.67 Since joining the administration, Grogan has led drug-pricing proposals and participated in Trump’s Drug Pricing and Innovation Working Group.”68", "However, the working group has proposed pharma-friendly measures such as implementing monopoly rights outside of the United States, speeding up approval from the FDA for new drugs, and eliminating price cuts for hospitals in impoverished areas.", "President Trump chose to replace Price with Alex Azar, the former president of Eli Lilly—one of the companies that is working to keep drug prices high while everyday Americans suffer—to oversee his efforts to address drug pricing as secretary of health and human services.", "In 2018, pharmaceutical companies spent more than $283 million in lobbying dollars69, with Eli Lilly spending just less than $6.8 million in 2018.70 While Azar, Trump’s chief health adviser, was president of Eli Lilly, the company drastically increased insulin prices.", "Eli Lilly is currently defending itself against a class-action lawsuit71 accusing the company of colluding with pharmacy benefit managers—individuals who negotiate drug pricing and availability with drug companies for the government and other insurance plans—to increase prices.", "Big Pharma and pharmacy benefit managers have been playing a blame game72 while lawmakers—who have held several hearings in the U.S. House of Representatives73 and the U.S. Senate74—try to find the source of America’s drug pricing problem.", "Given the sway that Big Pharma has with the administration, the industry has no plans to reduce prescription drug prices or reverse past price gouging.", "For his part, President Trump tried but failed to pass the American Health Care Act of 2017, which would have hurt millions of Americans while benefiting the pharmaceutical industry, among others.", "However, he was successful in signing into law a new tax bill that lowered the corporate tax rate by 14 percent, allowing pharmaceutical companies, including those with ties to the Trump administration, to save a total of $76 billion.75 After the tax law was enacted, Eli Lilly received a tax cut of nearly $4.5 billion on offshore profits.76 Instead of using these tax savings to lower drug prices, big pharmaceutical companies such as Eli Lilly together used $45 billion of their total tax savings77 to benefit shareholders via stock buyback programs.", "After President Trump helped Eli Lilly save billions, Azar, the company’s top executive, was confirmed to head the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services78 at the beginning of the following year.", "Although the Trump administration keeps promising to lower drug prices, drug costs continue to climb as Americans suffer and pharmaceutical companies profit and their CEOs line their pockets.", "The government-funded research and major tax benefits that these pharmaceutical companies enjoy help them stay profitable.", "Meanwhile, they continue to hike up the costs of drugs, particularly life-sustaining drugs such as insulin.", "Big Pharma can play this game indefinitely, benefiting from this culture of corruption, using allies in the administration and in Congress to grow their profit margins while everyday people suffer.", "But there are steps lawmakers can take to reduce the influence of special interests, including Big Pharma.79 For example, lobbyists are currently allowed to fundraise for candidates for federal office—and many of them provide far more financial support beyond the $2,800 per candidate limit by hosting fundraising events and bundling contributions.", "Banning lobbyists from fundraising80 for candidates would reduce special-interest influence over the legislative process.", "Another way to limit corrupting conflicts of interest is to ban members of Congress from accepting campaign donations from entities under the jurisdiction of the committees on which the serve.", "It is understood that conflicts can easily arise from committee contributions, which explains why 88 percent of voters support this prohibition.81 Additionally, Washington’s infamous revolving door between private industry and government must be closed.", "Proposals to do so include a lifetime lobbying ban on members of Congress and a five-year lobbying ban on senior congressional staffers.82", "As Americans are caught trying to decide whether to pay for rent or medicine, pharmaceutical companies continue to reap government benefits.", "Reducing drug prices and the costs that everyday people must pay is not possible without fixing the broken system in Washington."]}

Umbrella trials, such as the FOCUS trial, in colorectal cancer assess multiple biomarker‐based approaches to treating the same disease or tumor type in parallel.", "The FOCUS trial, for example, stratified patients into five molecular cohorts at the outset of treatment to test five treatments in parallel.18, 19 Basket trials test the effect of a single drug or drug combination on a variety of diseases or disease subtypes.", "The most common basket trials to date enroll patients with a broad variety of tumor types (e.g., non‐small cell lung cancer, ovarian, and colorectal, for example) in a single study.", "In basket trials, enrollment of patients with a specific genetic marker linked to a response to therapy allows the trial to demonstrate a statistically significant response to therapy with a relatively small number of enrolled patients and a variety of affected tissues.20", "This design allows investigators to explore the effect of a therapy targeting a specific molecular pathway that may be shared across a variety of tumor types but which may be relatively uncommon in any single tumor type.", "Thus, investigators can benefit from pooling patients with a variety of different tumors who may nevertheless be likely to respond to a single therapy targeting the specific mutation associated with those tumors.", "The earliest basket trials enrolled patients with a variety of tumor types that shared a common genetic marker and investigated their response to a single agent.21 The Novartis SIGNATURE program expanded on this approach and consisted of eight phase II single‐agent protocols running in parallel22 testing eight agents (buparlisib, dovitinib, binimetinib, encorafenib, sonidegib, BGJ398, ceritinib, and ribociclib23) in biomarker‐defined populations.", "The program enrolled patients with a broad variety of malignancies, including both solid tumors (e.g., non‐small cell lung cancer, breast cancer, colorectal cancer, and melanoma) and hematological cancers (chronic myeloid leukemia, acute lymphoblastic leukemia, and acute myeloid leukemia).", "The program did not depend on specific study sites; any physicians aware of the trial and with access to adequate research capabilities could identify patients for one of the eight trial protocols.", "This approach provides two opportunities: to minimize research costs by eliminating unproductive sites and comparing several agents at the same time and opening access to enrollment to patients treated at a broader variety of locations than a conventional trial.", "Adaptive trials are used across a broad variety of therapeutic areas and can address a variety of challenges in trial design for both acute and chronic conditions.", "The CHAMPION PHOENIX trial, for example, compared the rate of percutaneous coronary intervention–related ischemic complications in patients treated with cangrelor and those treated with clopidogrel.", "The study design allowed for an interim analysis to assess whether to increase the sample size of the trial based on whether results thus far were deemed sufficiently promising by the data and safety monitoring committee.11 Although the study did not require an increase in the sample size, the study's design allowed for the possibility of expanding enrollment to achieve adequate statistical power.", "The EXAMINE trial took a different approach that allowed investigators to consider whether to change the primary end point from noninferiority to superiority based on an interim analysis.11 EXAMINE compared the novel antihyperglycemic drug alogliptin to standard of care in reducing cardiovascular outcomes in patients with type 2 diabetes.", "At the trial's interim analysis, investigators assessed the probability of demonstrating superiority rather than inferiority; because the planned full trial enrollment was unlikely to achieve this goal and noninferiority had already been achieved, the trial was not continued beyond that point.", "In both of these examples, the inclusion of an interim analysis allowed investigators to avoid unnecessarily expanding or continuing trials—saving significant time and cost, but also ultimately benefiting patients, too.", "Cohort‐led design encompasses a variety of study designs and goals. Pragmatic trials, for example, aim to demonstrate clinical benefit in the real‐world setting.", "GlaxoSmithKline's Salford lung study provides one example of how pharmaceutical companies are trying to use pragmatic trials.", "The Salford lung study was an open‐label, randomized, real‐world trial comparing a once‐daily inhaler containing the long‐acting beta2 agonist vilanterol and the inhaled corticosteroid fluticasone furoate against existing therapy.16", "The trial design included relatively broad inclusion criteria and compared the fluticasone furoate/vilanterol combination inhaler against patients’ existing therapy, with the goal of producing results that can be more confidently generalized to real‐world medical practice and patient populations.", "The study showed a statistically significant reduction in exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease compared with usual care and showed improved disease control in asthma,24 providing proof‐of‐concept for the approach.25 However, to date, based on publicly available information, data from the Salford lung study has only been used in a regulatory context to fulfill a postapproval commitment on safety from the European Medicines Agency (EMA), rather than for efficacy.", "N‐of‐1 trials also use a nontraditional approach to measuring efficacy by comparing the response of a single patient to different interventions, typically introducing an intervention after charting the patient's progress without an intervention.", "Researchers can address the challenges associated with wide variation in individual responses to treatment by assessing individual responses in a cohort of patients and also in disease areas, such as rare diseases where there is a limited pool of patients.", "One example of an n‐of‐1 trial is the Australian Health Ministers’ Advisory Council trial, which generated results suggesting lower efficacy for gabapentin in treating neuropathic pain than had been estimated based on traditional randomized controlled trials.15 For the purposes of this trial, the n‐of‐1 design presented an advantage over conventional trial design because individual responses to pain medications vary widely, and investigators wanted to better understand responses at the individual level.", "The trial enrolled a total of 73 patients, each of whom was treated with three cycles of gabapentin and placebo assigned in random order, and patients were assessed individually for responses to gabapentin and to placebo to arrive at the conclusion that gabapentin may not be as effective as previously believed.", "Regulators Welcome Innovative Clinical Trial Designs", "Regulators are responding to the increasing complexity of the new therapeutic drugs in the pipeline by encouraging innovative approaches to clinical trials while demanding that new treatments demonstrate meaningful patient outcomes, often with a drug comparator (not placebo).", "As shown in Figure 3 a, the number of innovative trials included in approved FDA applications was greater in 2017 than in 2010 across all therapeutic areas.", "For example, in oncology, avelumab (Bavencio), a drug approved by the FDA in 2017, used a novel design in early stage clinical trials.", "The phase I Javelin solid tumor study, a novel dose‐expansion design, was used to test safety and efficacy in multiple solid tumor types in parallel.26", "The study enrolled a total of 1,700 patients comprising 12 solid tumor types and took place in two parts.", "The first part of the study used a conventional dose‐escalation design, whereas the second part divided patients into cohorts for a dose‐expansion study.", "The goal of the latter was to further understand toxicity and to explore efficacy in specific tumor types identified as having high unmet need, programmed cell death‐ligand 1 overexpression, and likelihood of responsiveness to immunotherapy based on prior evidence and data gathered in the initial part of the Javelin trial.", "Trials using this type of design are becoming increasingly common in oncology because, although they prolong the duration of phase I, they can provide more information at an earlier stage of development than conventional designs.27 As oncology moves increasingly toward precision medicine, clinical trial design in oncology will likely continue to evolve.28", "Oncology is not the only therapeutic area in which regulators are signaling an openness to novel trial designs.", "For the central nervous system product for enzyme replacement therapy in Batten disease, cerliponase alfa (Brineura), one single‐arm trial was used to support the FDA approval, and it was also continued post approval, demonstrating continued reduction.8 Patients on treatment were compared against a similar natural history cohort.", "Opting for a single‐arm design meant that a smaller pool of patients was sufficient to run the trial, which was critical given the limited available patient pediatric population.", "However, regulators are not yet ready to grant approval based on real‐world data studies; these remain limited to postapproval safety and efficacy studies rather than pre approval studies.29", "This is not surprising given the risks of failing to show significance in a heterogeneous population pre approval.", "Pharmaceutical companies are reluctant to jeopardize approval by collecting data from a broad population with little exclusion.", "Nevertheless, both pharmaceutical companies and regulators are moving toward trial designs that more closely reflect real‐world clinical practice than traditional randomized controlled trials.", "Pfizer's inotuzumab ozogamicin (Besponsa) received FDA approval in 2016 based on the results of the phase", "III INO‐VATE ALL study, an open‐label study that compared the activity of inotuzumab ozogamicin to investigator's choice of chemotherapy regimen8, 30 rather than to a single comparator.", "Pragmatic trials have also been suggested as a potentially valuable way to provide expanded insights about drugs approved through accelerated pathways or that demonstrate exceptional activity during pivotal trials, leading to early termination and approval.31 Post approval, Tesaro is conducting a pragmatic trial of its drug niraparib (Zejula), which received FDA approval in 2017 for ovarian cancer.", "The BRAVO trial is comparing progression‐free survival with niraparib or with investigator's choice from four standard of care therapies in patients with advanced/metastatic breast cancer who have a breast cancer gene change.32 Unfortunately, physicians opted for other poly ADP ribose polymerase therapies rather than the standard of care chemotherapies and, therefore, enrollment in the trial has been low.", "This is a downside of pragmatic trials in which there is less control of how patients are managed and where exclusion criteria may still not be sufficiently wide to capture real‐life clinical practice.", "Others have described how often trials coined as “pragmatic” may still have characteristics of a tightly controlled randomized clinical trial.33", "Companies have other postapproval uses of real‐world data, to support payer negotiations and pricing as well as to strengthen commercial claims.34 For example, Boehringer Ingelheim's dabigatran (Pradaxa) has been examined in several real‐world trials to assess both postapproval efficacy and safety including the FDA Mini‐Sentinel Trial, the FDA Medicare Assessment Trial, and the Department of Defense trial.35 This has served the company well in its claims for safety and efficacy.", "It is interesting to note that our research did not identify any innovative trial designs for many indications that were in the spotlight over the past decade, such as psoriasis, rheumatoid arthritis, type 2 diabetes, and others.", "This underscores the extent to which innovation in trial design is currently driven heavily by the characteristics of diseases with significant unmet medical need, where few precedents exist, patient populations are small, and well‐validated clinical end points are difficult to identify.", "In addition to the focus on outcomes by regulators more broadly,2 regulators are open to the use of surrogate end points in conditions with particular unmet need.", "Figure 3 b shows a fourfold increase in the use of surrogate end points from 2010−2017. The most marked increase in surrogate end points is in oncology, driven by the use of biomarkers that provide confidence in relying on the surrogate end point objective response rate (ORR) rather than requiring the traditional direct end point overall survival.", "The FDA's accelerated approval of copanlisib (Aliqopa), for example, was based on a single‐arm phase II trial as the pivotal trial with ORR as the primary end point in relapsed follicular lymphoma.7 Surrogate end points have become particularly important in oncology trials because drug developers are pursuing rarer cancers with narrowly defined subpopulations for which achieving sufficient enrollment to measure traditional end points would substantially slow or limit development.", "A recent analysis of the acceptance of ORR in regulatory submissions concluded that it was an appropriate end point for assessing efficacy in regulatory submissions, underscoring regulators’ openness to new approaches to trial design in oncology.36 The increase in surrogate end points in 2017 in anti‐infectives is also driven by the approval of two hepatitis C treatments on the basis of sustained viral response after 12 weeks of treatment levels; other anti‐infective surrogate end points for vaccines have been used in the past.", "Patient‐Reported Outcomes complementing the clinical trial execution toolkit", "Both regulators and pharmaceutical companies have also shown interest in collecting PROs. To date, PROs have been included in trials as secondary end points.", "In 2010, only one product approved by the FDA included PROs as part of the regulatory submission, but by 2017, this number had increased to 12, as shown in Figure 3 c. To date, PROs have already been gathered across a wide variety of therapeutic areas.", "Again, oncology has the greatest number of regulatory submissions, including PROs as secondary end points.", "For 2017 FDA approvals, five drugs included PROs (Bayer's copanlisib, Takeda's brigatinib (Alunbrig), Novartis’ midostaurin (Rydapt), Eli Lilly's abemaciclib (Verzenio), and Tesaro's niraparib).", "In addition, they have also been included in regulatory submissions for the rare blood disorder hemophilia A (Roche's emicizumab‐kxwh (Hemlibra)), asthma (AstraZeneca's benralizumab (Fasenra)), psoriasis (Janssen's guselkumab (Tremfya) and Bausch Health's brodalumab (Siliq)), and type 2 diabetes (Novo Nordisk's semaglutide (Ozempic)).", "PROs have increased because they offer unique opportunities to pharmaceutical companies: for example, to more effectively assess whether the drug is delivering effective patient‐centered care and the ability to test companion digital applications for postapproval use in the clinical trial.", "Although regulators have not yet reached the stage in which they would rely on PROs over traditional end points, they are supportive of their inclusion in pivotal trials.", "PROs can provide useful validation that objective measurements of efficacy correlate with meaningful improvements in quality of life for patients.", "One notable example of the value of including PROs in regulatory submissions is Incyte's ruxolitinib (Jakafi).", "In 2011, ruxolitinib became the first drug to receive FDA approval for the treatment of myelofibrosis, a chronic neoplastic myeloproliferative disorder with debilitating symptoms.37 The end points that were included in the COMFORT‐1 trial (one of two pivotal trials) were a primary end point measuring reduction in spleen size and a secondary end point designed to measure the impact of therapy on patients’ symptoms that used a PRO tool called the modified Myelofibrosis Symptom Assessment Form.37, 38", "The study not only supported regulatory approval for the drug but also underscored the value of assessing symptoms as well as objective measures of spleen size reduction in myelofibrosis.", "In contrast with other innovative trial designs and end points, PROs are also being included in clinical trials of long‐established conditions with well‐defined clinical trial designs and regulatory pathways, such as asthma, psoriasis, and type 2 diabetes.", "This suggests companies perceive additional value from PROs that they cannot capture from traditional direct end points, surrogate end points, and investigators’ assessments of disease.", "For example, psoriasis trials have historically relied heavily on the Psoriasis Area and Severity Index, an investigator assessment of patients’ psoriasis symptoms.", "However, psoriasis has a substantial impact on patients’ quality of life, and trials have traditionally included quality of life assessments, such as the Dermatology Life Quality Index, but the Dermatology Life Quality Index and similar instruments were not developed specifically for psoriasis.39 Investigators see additional value in psoriasis‐specific PROs developed to conform to the FDA PRO guidance as the landscape for psoriasis treatment becomes more crowded with an array of novel therapies.39 It is not surprising then that Janssen and Bausch Health included PROs in the regulatory submissions for guselkumab and brodalumab.", "Linked with the increase in innovative clinical trial designs, multiple stakeholders, including regulators, payers, Health Technology Assessment (HTA) bodies, patient groups, and drug developers across the globe have recognized the need to develop pathways for accelerated access to innovative drugs.40, 41, 42 Regulators have developed programs to expedite drug development to bring innovative medicines to patients more quickly.", "Although each program/scheme has slightly different eligibility criteria and definitions of unmet need, the principles and intentions of these top regulators are similar: provide guidance to drug developers regarding key issues in trial design and analysis, and shorten development and review timelines.", "In Japan, the development was part of a broader initiative by the Pharmaceuticals and Medical Devices Agency (PMDA), which put the SAKIGAKE program in place in 2014 ( Table S1 ) to reduce the well‐documented lag in approvals of innovative medicines in Japan following European Union and FDA approvals.43 As of 2016, Japan seemed to be closing the gap in approval timing; 41 drugs with new active ingredients were approved in Japan compared with 27 in the European Union, and the Japan review timelines were approximately half those of the European Union.44", "Table S1 summarizes different initiatives introduced by regulators in major markets, all with the aim of accelerating access to novel therapies.45, 46, 47, 48", "The FDA provides five specific pathways to allow therapies in areas of high unmet need to reach the market more rapidly.", "Notably, both fast track and accelerated approval have clear implications for companies developing clinical trial programs in terms of both benefits and requirements.", "Drugs receiving fast track designation may be approved based on phase IIa trials, and drugs considered under accelerated approval are able to use surrogate end points that can be measured in trials of shorter duration than may be necessary to measure direct clinical outcomes.", "The outcome of both schemes is earlier market entry with a commitment to validate findings with real outcomes in longer term, postapproval studies, often in a real‐world setting.", "Similarly, the EMA has several programs in place to accelerate drug development for areas of high unmet medical need.", "These include Accelerated Review, Conditional Approval, and two relatively new programs, Adaptive Pathways and PRIME.", "The Adaptive Pathways program was introduced in 2014 with the goal of providing a pathway to approval for areas of high unmet need where collecting data through traditional randomized controlled trials is particularly challenging.", "The randomized clinical trial design can be particularly challenging to correlate with real‐world outcomes in rare diseases; Fabry's disease has been cited as an example of a rare disease where a regulatory program like Adaptive Pathways would have yielded more meaningful, applicable trial results than a traditional program of randomized controlled trials.49 The EMA concluded a pilot assessment of the program in 2016 and decided to continue to launch the program going forward.50, 51 Some stakeholders—especially HTAs and payers—have expressed concerns that their evidentiary requirements differ from those of the Adaptive Pathways program, and that determining how to assess these agents will pose significant challenges, especially as they will need to reassess initial evaluations as postmarketing data become available.52,", "53 However, an EMA official cited the case of alemtuzumab (Lemtrada), a high‐cost multiple sclerosis drug, as a case study in how even under conventional regulatory procedures, the argument for cost‐effectiveness of a drug can evolve over time.54 As the EMA seems committed to the Adaptive Pathways program, these issues will need to be addressed by HTAs and payers.55 It also noted that the Adaptive Pathways program and PRIME involve discussions with payers in which the payer evidentiary needs can be highlighted.", "Within and in addition to the above programs, regulators are also putting effort behind developing guidance for industry on how and where to utilize genetic biomarkers and real‐world data.", "Enacted in the United States in 2016, the 21st Century Cures Act mandated that the FDA provide clear guidance to industry on where and how real‐world data can be used to supplement randomized controlled trials.", "The FDA expects to issue guidance on real‐world evidence in December 2018 that will provide a framework for assessing data sources and will establish standards and methodologies for the use of real‐world data in clinical trials.56 Notably, the 21st Century Cures Act only requires the FDA to consider real‐world evidence for extension of indications to currently approved drugs.", "This is not surprising, as the risk to regulator and company are less with existing products, whereas the methodological aspects and limitations are worked out.", "Innovation in accelerated pathways continues. The FDA has as recently as this year created two new pilot programs to facilitate more efficient drug development specifically in oncology.", "The Real‐Time Oncology Review (RTOR) program allows for FDA review of clinical trial data prior to formal submission to provide feedback to the trial sponsor regarding data analysis.57", "The Assessment Aid program provides a structured template to applicants to help streamline the submission and review process.57 In July 2018, the agency announced that Novartis’ breast cancer drug ribociclib (Kisquali) was the first drug to receive approval after using the new programs,8 and it also benefited from priority review and breakthrough designation.8 The RTOR scheme is similar to the EMA's adaptive pathways scheme, which also enables companies to submit data as it becomes available.", "Implications for Pharma sponsor regulatory approaches", "With an array of regulatory flexibilities and new tools at their disposal (e.g., real‐world data, biomarkers, and digital tools to collect PROs), it is now up to pharmaceutical companies to take advantage of these capabilities to bring innovative products to market earlier.", "The trend in the use of regulatory flexibilities has been an overall increase since 2010 in the United States (Figure 4 a,b).", "The most commonly used flexibility as of 2017 in the United States was Priority Review, but the use of Breakthrough Therapy designation has increased markedly in recent years.", "Although EMA's Adaptive Pathways scheme has not yet been widely used and the full impact of the 21st Century Cures Act is still years away, there is a clear intent of regulators to encourage the use of real‐world data, especially in the postapproval setting.", "However, real‐world data can also be used to inform drug development programs, even when the data will not feed into a regulatory submission.", "The information can be used to chart natural disease progression and be used to inform baseline improvements that could be made with interventions as well as for collecting safety information and refining the populations that would benefit most for the product post approval.", "Pharmaceutical companies are, therefore, increasing their efforts to identify how they can use advanced analytics to mine existing regulatory submissions and assessment reports from regulators to increase the accuracy with which they predict regulatory success.", "Pharmaceutical companies have already successfully mined data to identify safety signals and inform risk management plans, and companies have also attempted to mine clinical data to identify repositioning and new indication opportunities.58", "Several published studies have demonstrated factors that correlate with a higher likelihood of regulatory success.", "Factors that correlated with higher frequency of regulatory approval included orphan drug status, high unmet need, clear evidence on efficacy, scientific advice, and prior company experience in the relevant therapeutic area.", "However, companies have not yet leveraged artificial intelligence or undertaken internal initiatives to understand which factors within their own portfolios serve as predictors of regulatory success.59 Ultimately, better predictive analytics could help identify likely regulatory success based on prior experience internally with a type of trial, type of comparator, or number of trials submitted, thereby improving development and avoiding costly delays and failures in late‐phase development.60 Such information could also inform discussions with regulators on trial design.", "Finally, implementing true live licensing would represent a significant milestone. Pharmaceutical companies could provide data updates to regulators as data becomes available, allowing timely feedback between companies and regulators.", "Both the EMA's Adaptive Pathways and the FDA's RTOR pilot program are clear initial steps in this direction.", "The recent approval of Novartis’ ribociclib is an early success story in developing a live licensing pathway, as it provides proof‐of‐concept that the FDA can conduct a rolling review for a product in development.", "Although much of the focus on both trial design and digital innovation has been trained on developed markets such as the United States, Europe, and Japan, the emerging markets cannot be overlooked.", "Moreover, some of these regulators may be well‐positioned to respond rapidly to digital and perhaps “leapfrog” mature markets.", "With emerging markets growing in importance, the pharmaceutical industry can partner with these markets to strengthen regulatory systems and support harmonization.", "Regulators in BRIC (Brazil, Russia, India, and China), Africa, the ASEAN region, and the Middle East are adapting to the changing environment in the pharmaceutical industry, trying to keep pace with their peers in the United States, Europe, and Japan.", "Mexico's COFEPRIS recently underwent a major modernization exercise and has updated its generic drugs licensing pathway and reduced its backlogs.61 Saudi Arabia's FDA released its 5‐year strategy in May 2018 highlighting the desire to proactively monitor use and safety of products in a real‐life setting by specific registries in addition to the already ongoing pack serialization scheme “track and trace.”62", "Many organizations, including the World Health Organization, and individual regional harmonization initiatives have been encouraging emerging market regulators to rely on prior approvals and Good Manufacturing Practice inspections to accelerate access to products in their markets.63 Several not‐for‐profit organizations have provided significant support for these efforts, recognizing that reliance, harmonization, and coordination encourages innovators to bring products intended for diseases that otherwise would be neglected.", "However, as noted in a study examining adoption of technical documents developed to harmonize regulatory standards in the Pan‐American region, progress toward harmonization remains dependent on countries having adequate capabilities to perform the regulatory functions recommended in harmonization efforts.64 As a result, progress toward harmonization varies considerably by region, and some regions have relatively ambitious harmonization initiatives underway, whereas others remain in relatively early stages of development.", "The level of ambition of regulatory harmonization initiatives across the globe is summarized in Figure 5.64, 65, 66, 67, 68, 69 The ZAZIBONA collaboration of countries from the South African Development Community and the Gulf region's Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC)‐DR are both relatively ambitious initiatives that created collaborative or centralized review and approval of drugs that have already been used extensively and resulted in hundreds of approvals.65", "In contrast, the ASEAN initiative has comparatively modest ambitions, with its goals focused on strengthening regulatory functions and developing guidelines but not implementing a centralized review process.", "The PANDRH initiative in Latin America is similarly focused on improving existing processes rather than developing a centralized process for review and approval.", "The technological advances with digital products are also shaping regulatory policy. Regulators see opportunities with digital therapeutics and are encouraging digital applications and predictive analytics to support clinical development.", "As the personalization of health care expands, the expectation is that there will be more digital products marketed as companion products for specific drugs to support dosing and treatment duration.", "Clear guidelines regarding what is required for approval will be important to support the industry and ensure sufficient safeguards are in place when tools can alter the course of diagnosis or treatment.", "This is because there are significant risks for patients with these products where the predictive algorithm may negatively impact patient treatment decisions.", "As a result, the landscape of digital oversight by regulators is rapidly evolving.

not profit motive.”", "Beginning at the launch of Aranesp in 2002 and extending until 2007, Amgen illegally introduced Aranesp for uses and at dosage levels that the FDA had specifically declined to approve due to insufficient clinical evidence to establish their safety and efficacy.", "In particular, Amgen illegally introduced Aranesp into the oncology and nephrology ESA markets, intending that it be used for patients suffering from anemia due to chronic kidney disease or chemotherapy at off-label, unapproved doses that were larger and less frequently administered than those approved by the FDA for these patient populations.", "Amgen also illegally introduced Aranesp into the oncology ESA market intending that it be used to treat anemia caused by cancer, irrespective of whether the patient had been prescribed chemotherapy - a use which the FDA had never approved and which the FDA subsequently determined caused an increased risk of death.", "In particular, in 2007, the FDA mandated that a “black box” label be added to Aranesp’s label, warning that Aranesp “increased the risk of death . . .", "in patients with active malignant disease [cancer] receiving neither chemotherapy nor radiation.” At approximately the time that the FDA issued the black box warning, Amgen ceased its promotion of Aranesp for the treatment of anemia caused by cancer rather than the cancer’s treatment.", "Amgen’s internal sales and marketing materials made plain that Amgen’s misbranding of Aranesp was the company’s core business strategy to gain market share from its only ESA competitor, Procrit, sold by Johnson & Johnson.", "At the time of Aranesp’s 2002 launch, doctors typically prescribed Procrit to treat the anemic patient populations for which Aranesp was approved.", "To compete with Procrit, Amgen built the Aranesp commercial strategy around the unapproved, off-label approach of a less frequent dosing schedule, which Amgen sales representatives argued was more convenient for patients and more profitable for doctors.", "Amgen implemented this illegal commercial effort through its promotion of off-label doses from two to four times larger than those approved by the FDA, administered far less frequently than approved by the FDA.", "When this unapproved, off-label dosing effort proved commercially successful, Amgen sales and marketing executives determined that capturing the population of anemic cancer patients who were not undergoing chemotherapy was “the next big thing” and would give Amgen a “51 percent [ESA] market share.”", "Accordingly, the company set about capturing the off-label market of patients suffering from anemia caused by cancer itself, rather than anemia caused by chemotherapy, and its sales representatives began marketing the safety and efficacy of Aranesp in that population.", "Ultimately, in 2007, the FDA determined that Aranesp increased the risk of death in that very population.", "Aware that its misbranding of Aranesp was illegal, Amgen instructed its sales representatives to promote off-label uses through the guise of “reactive marketing.”", "This technique attempted to circumvent the law by inducing doctors to ask questions about an off-label use, to serve as a smokescreen to hide Amgen’s intentional effort to introduce the drug for unapproved, “off-label” uses.", "Amgen thus trained its sales representatives to intentionally elicit questions from doctors about off-label uses as legal cover to then provide the doctors with studies supporting the off-label use, thereby promoting the drug for that unapproved use.", "The studies Amgen provided to doctors to support off-label uses were often the very same studies that the FDA had rejected as insufficient to support the safety and efficacy of those off-label uses, when Amgen had applied to expand Aranesp’s label to encompass them.", "The $612 million dollar civil settlement encompasses broader allegations by the United States against Amgen than those contained in the Information.", "The civil settlement agreement resolves claims contained in ten lawsuits against Amgen that were brought under the qui tam, or whistle-blower, provisions of the False Claims Act, which allow private citizens to bring civil actions on behalf of the United States and share in any recovery.", "Seven of these cases currently are pending in the Eastern District of New York; two are pending in the District of Massachusetts and one in the Western District of Washington.", "The ten cases are: United States ex rel.

The five-year CIA includes provisions designed to increase accountability of individuals and Board members, to increase transparency, and to strengthen Amgen’s compliance program.", "The CIA requires that a committee of Amgen’s board of directors annually review the effectiveness of the company’s compliance program and that executives in key areas certify to compliance.", "It also requires that Amgen post on its company website information about payments to doctors. Under the CIA, Amgen must establish and maintain a centralized risk assessment and mitigation program and policies relating to research, publications and Amgen’s interactions with federal payors.", "Amgen is subject to exclusion from federal health care programs for a material breach of the CIA and subject to monetary penalties for less significant breaches.", "“We continue our two-pronged attack on alleged fraudulent corporate behavior,” said Daniel R.

Genetics Institute in July with the “composition of matter” patent and a liquid chromatography-based process for producing it, and Amgen in October with a patent for the erythropoietin DNA sequence and a recombinant DNA process for manufacturing it.[7] Genetics Institute’s method of erythropoietin production was to isolate from urine, making it unviable to produce mass quantities needed for the market.", "On the other hand, Amgen’s patent for the mode of erythropoietin production made it commercially viable to produce the substance, although the patent from Genetics Institute was a legal barrier for Amgen to use the starting materials to synthesize erythropoietin.", "Thus, neither Genetics Institute nor Amgen had the ability to commercialize erythropoietin without infringing the other’s patents.", "The litigation and legal proceedings, which lasted nearly 8 years, concluded with a final ruling in Amgen’s favor in 1995.[8] In short, the Courts found the Genetics Institute patent to provide an inadequate description of a generic method for obtaining human erythropoietin and thus, there was no evidence that Genetics Institute had isolated the protein with the biological profile described in the patent.", "Genetics Institute sought a patent on the recombinant production of erythropoietin in Europe and was awarded such in May 1991 with the rights acquired by Boehringer Mannheim (later Roche).[9]", "This patent would become the basis for the development of epoetin beta.", "As short-acting drugs, first generation erythropoietin required frequent dosing to maintain adequate hemoglobin levels, given a half-life of approximately 8 hours.", "“Next generation erythropoietins”, including darbepoetin alfa and a pegylated version of epoetin beta, were developed with altered structures, extending the elimination half-life of the drug and reducing the dose schedule necessary for hemoglobin maintenance—ranging from once-weekly to once monthly depending on the indication in CKD.", "Darbepoetin alfa (Aranesp®) was developed by Amgen as a modified hyperglycosylated epoetin;

In particular, concerns regarding pure red cell aplasia (PRCA) and increased cardiovascular-related adverse events have been of great interest to the nephrology community and are relevant to the development of new ESAs.", "The sudden appearance outside the US of patients presenting with antibody-mediated PRCA in the late 1990s, primarily associated with subcutaneous administration of Eprex, highlighted the potential consequence of manufacturing changes on product safety.[14]", "Furthermore, several cardiovascular (CV) outcome-related studies pointed to an increase in CV adverse events associated with higher hemoglobin targets and the increasing doses of ESAs required to achieve those targets.[15,16]", "As a consequence, the FDA (as well as other regulatory bodies around the world) stipulated a warning in 2007 for all ESAs prompting clinicians to use the lowest dose of drug in patients to maintain adequate hemoglobin levels.[17]", "A small number of case reports of an antibody-mediated form of PRCA associated with ESA therapy began to appear in the literature around the mid-1990s, but the complication did not receive much attention until an “epidemic” of ESA-associated PRCA occurred between 1998 and 2004.[18]", "In 1998, Johnson & Johnson, the manufacturer of Eprex, changed the stabilizing agent of the product from human serum albumin to polysorbate 80 and glycine, prompted by European concern about the potential for transmission of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease.[14] After much study, it was hypothesized that the polysorbate 80 may have increased the immunogenicity of Eprex by eliciting formation of epoetin-containing micelles or by interacting with leachates released by the uncoated rubber stoppers of prefilled syringes for subcutaneous administration.[19]", "Compared with the previous formulation, the polysorbate 80 formulation had a lower stability, making it more susceptible to stress conditions (e.g., insufficient attention to the cold chain).", "This situation may have facilitated protein denaturation or aggregate formation.[20]", "From 1999 to 2002, global reports of antibody-mediated PRCA increased with more than 60 cases of PRCA reported with Eprex per year.[18]", "In December 2002, health authorities in Europe formally contraindicated subcutaneous administration of Eprex for patients with chronic kidney disease.[19,21]", "The incidence of PRCA returned to historical low rates by 2003 after Johnson & Johnson replaced the uncoated rubber stoppers with Teflon stoppers in the prefilled syringes, supported intravenous administration of the product, and improved cold chain storage management.[14,20] The contraindication for subcutaneous administration of Eprex was later removed in 2006 after completion of the PRIMS study, which showed that rates of PRCA had returned to the expected background incidence.[19]", "As treatment with ESAs were rarely ‘switched’ during this time period, it is likely that identification of the source of immunogenicity in patients receiving Eprex was the result of a common treatment pattern by nephrologists.", "Although the dramatic spike in PRCA cases has decreased since the early 2000s, a small number of cases have continued to be reported worldwide—almost all associated with subcutaneous administration.", "Although intravenous administration of a protein is less likely to evoke an immune response than the subcutaneous route, PRCA with intravenous administration of epoetin has been reported in the literature, including a case in Japan where a patient received both epoetin alfa and darbepoetin alfa.[22] Two additional cases of PRCA with intravenous epoetin have been described, but follow-up did not preclude the subcutaneous route of administration.[23]", "Furthermore, several cases of PRCA have also been reported following the use of epoetin ‘copy’ biologics in regions where there are less rigorous regulations regarding product storage and manufacturing.[20]", "The use of blood transfusions and androgenic steroids for the treatment of anemia in patients with CKD was supplanted by ESAs, likely the result of improved quality of life in early studies involving erythropoietin and CKD.", "As the link between cardiovascular disease and CKD became more evident, it became clear that anemia was an independent risk factor for developing left ventricular hypertrophy and heart failure.", "However, in the absence of well-controlled studies, ESAs became the mainstay to treat anemia while the optimal level of hemoglobin to limit cardiovascular events remained unknown.", "Between 1991 and 2005, the mean ESA dose increased about four-fold in dialysis patients in the US.[24]", "Following reports of increased adverse events from outcomes studies, such as cardiovascular events and more frequent hypertensive episodes when using higher doses of ESAs to achieve higher hemoglobin targets, the FDA mandated a black box warning for all ESAs in 2007.[17]", "The decision was based on key data obtained from the Normal Hematocrit Cardiac Trial (NHCT),[25] the Correction of Hemoglobin and Outcomes in Renal Insufficiency (CHOIR) study, [15] and the Cardiovascular Risk Reduction by Early Anemia Treatment with Epoetin Beta (CREATE) study.[16]", "Briefly, the results of NHCT pointed to an increase in vascular access thrombosis and a trend towards death and heart attacks among dialysis patients in the higher hematocrit arm, while the CHOIR study confirmed an increased risk of a composite endpoint including death and cardiovascular events among predialysis patients targeted to higher hematocrit levels.", "The CREATE study did not demonstrate differences between patients assigned to either full or partial correction of anemia in terms of cardiovascular events, but a prespecified secondary analysis showed a higher risk of end-stage renal disease requiring dialysis among the patients with the higher target for hemoglobin concentration.", "More recent studies, including the Trial to Reduce Cardiovascular Events with Aranesp Therapy (TREAT) and the subanalysis of the Reduction of Events by Darbepoetin Alfa in Heart Failure (RED-HF) study, reinforce the aforementioned data and demonstrate the correction of anemia in CKD patients with ESAs does not confer a beneficial effect on mortality, or cardiovascular or renal outcomes.[26,27]", "As noted, biologics are genetically-engineered proteins derived from human, animal, or microorganism sources.", "They are a major area of growth in the medical community, accounting for one-third of new medicine approvals in the past decade.[28]", "As of 2013, the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America reported more than 900 biologics in development.[28] Biologics play an integral and often transformative role in many therapeutic settings, and guidelines from medical societies and payer groups have incorporated biologics into recommended treatment regimens, either as primary or supportive care.[4]", "Despite the immense therapeutic benefit conferred to patients, the growing use of biologics comes at a significant cost, representing one of the fastest growing segments of stretched healthcare budgets around the world.[29] Unlike small-molecule drugs, synthesized by chemically reproducible processes, biologics are genetically-engineered proteins that are produced by living systems and have inherent variability.", "Due to the large and structurally complex molecules that comprise biologics, as well as differences in cell lines and processes used during manufacturing, “identical” copies of biologics cannot be developed.", "Thus, a similar copy of a biologic drug, a “biosimilar”, is not to be regarded as a generic version of a currently approved biologic.", "Rather, a biosimilar is a biologic drug that is highly similar to an approved reference biologic drug.", "The high level of similarity to the reference product includes the same primary structure, mechanism of action, and drug target, among other physiochemical similarities, based on the results of an extensive comparability exercise which includes clinical confirmation of pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics outlined by regulatory authorities.[30,31] A product that does not meet these standards cannot be approved as a biosimilar.", "For biosimilars to achieve full acceptance in global markets, it is crucial that they be considered analytically, pharmacokinetically, and therapeutically equivalent with their reference product.", "Thus, biosimilars must go through a rigorous development process and comparability exercise, and demonstrate no clinically significant differences in safety, purity, and potency compared to the reference product.", "Given the inherent variability of a biologic compared with a small-drug molecules and acknowledging a biosimilar cannot be “identical” to a reference biologic product (which itself is structurally variable from batch to batch), regulatory authorities recognized the need for a unique approval pathway for biosimilars distinct from generics.", "The European Union (EU) was the first to establish a specific regulatory pathway for biosimilars.

VBPs of this structure are relatively new for both organizations.", "Therefore, we wanted to position this opportunity for success without overly complicating the interventions just for the sake of perceived innovation.", "For that reason, we chose to leverage the current capabilities and resources already available from each party and to design a strategy that allows us to leverage the combined resources to generate a greater impact.", "Together, we both have subject matter expertise to successfully operationalize and optimize a program outside of our partnership.", "Through more efficient data analytics and patient identification, earlier identification of clinical gaps in care can be identified and relayed to the clinical team for early intervention.", "Early patient engagement and facilitating appropriate transitions of care in patients with osteoporosis is essential to minimizing the risk of future fractures and subsequent disability.", "We anticipate this program will provide insight into the outcomes associated with a new approach to patient care and lay the foundation for other value-based initiatives in the future.", "Additionally, both parties want to ensure that the outcomes of this partnership would be feasible to implement within various types of members of the healthcare community, regardless of the plan’s level of data integration.", "AJMC®: How does your organization view the involvement of Amgen?", "Magellan views this as a true collaboration with joint decision making, equivalent contributions, and benefit to both parties.", "Magellan and Amgen have developed a JSC responsible for maintaining project oversight and providing an avenue for co-decisions on project design, patient identification algorithms, educational resources, outcomes measurement, and results communication.", "AJMC®: What are the expected benefits for your organization from this collaboration with Amgen?", "From the Magellan perspective, there are a few objectives for this collaboration. First, to provide a real-world example of the outcomes that can be generated from an innovative payer/pharma collaboration, to engage in more partnership opportunities in the future and ultimately find new ways of providing value to our clients.", "Second, to determine if a high-touch program can improve health outcomes in patients with osteoporosis, which would allow Magellan and Amgen to use these insights to co-develop a program that can be offered to other payers.", "Finally, we would like to be an innovator in the realm of VBPs through improved relationships with manufacturers like Amgen.", "Outcomes will be measured based on a comprehensive analysis of medical and pharmacy administrative claims data.", "There are several metrics that will be analyzed, including:", "AJMC®: Besides benefits to your organization, what benefits to the patient population are expected through these partnerships and how will these patient benefits be measured?", "Our hope is that the results and insights from this program will help inform and improve postfracture care with the number one objective to reduce subsequent fractures.", "This will be measured by the percent of patients receiving follow-up bone density scans and/or osteoporosis pharmacologic therapy within 6 months of having a fracture and by using administrative claims data to assess overall healthcare utilization.", "AJMC®: Do Amgen and your organization have a communication plan currently in place to share new solutions or results arising from the partnership and to share program successes?", "Not specifically, but we have agreed that we will work together to disseminate the information. This will be the responsibility of the JSC to determine the most appropriate avenue for results communication.", "Ideally, we’d like to publish the program results in a peer-reviewed journal, present the outcomes at industry conferences, and disseminate through other appropriate channels.", "On the Magellan side, we may potentially develop continuing medical education programs for our providers.", "In addition, both parties may have other mechanisms to share information with relevant stakeholders, including customers, to highlight the information, processes, and outcomes generated from a new approach to managing osteoporosis patients following a fracture.", "AJMC®: Would you recommend this model or offer any advice for other organizations interested in this type of value-based collaborative partnership with a biotechnology company?", "This is certainly a substantial time and resource commitment. Unfortunately, many healthcare stakeholders, including health plans, are strapped for both clinical and analytic resources and need a trusted third party to be able to carry the resource burden of implementing a partnership like this.", "This provides us with a unique opportunity to explore every possible avenue to provide information and insights to healthcare stakeholders.", "The healthcare environment is drastically changing, but what isn’t changing is the need to drive improved health outcomes as a strategy to reduce overall cost of care.", "If these partnerships can demonstrate a meaningful impact on quality of care or cost avoidance, then all healthcare stakeholders may begin to view partnerships with pharmaceutical manufacturers in a new light.", "Case Study on Value-based Partnerships with Amgen and Baylor Scott & White: An Expert Perspective from Andrew L. Masica, MD, MSCI", "AJMC®: What led you to explore a collaborative VBP with Amgen? What were your organization’s reasons for entering in a partnership like this with a biotechnology manufacturer?", "For us, it’s about being cognizant of healthcare delivery in a market that is moving toward a value-based model where you’re increasingly being paid on quality and outcome measures rather than volume.", "In the context of that evolution, the relationship of industry and pharma has historically been transactional with integrated delivery organizations.", "To really be successful in the value-based marketplace, it must be more of a collaborative and mutually beneficial partnership.", "Both entities have a mutual interest in the patients served by the delivery organization. That’s where you want to leverage the partnership approach as opposed to a transactional model.", "VBPs also fit our broader organizational transformation and preparations to operate as a care delivery and wellness maintenance system of the future.", "AJMC®: What was your internal process like for entering a formal partnership with Amgen?", "Initial discussions focused on therapeutic areas of interest at BSWH and Amgen. Once we identified common priorities for both parties, it allowed us to explore the partnership further.", "Each partner brings something different to the table, in terms of innovation and transforming care. Industry has the technology, business model, and resources to help develop new therapies.", "Delivery organizations can and should be directly involved in evidence generation and development of approaches for better care, but also represent the settings in which new therapies can be evaluated and applied.", "Once there was a recognition of a potential shared benefit derived from a VBP, we had to look at specific questions.", "Did we have the right environment such that it would make sense to put this partnership in place? Were the therapeutic areas identified as a priority for our patient population as well as for our organization?", "Did the collective group have the right subject matter expertise? Could outcomes from the partnership address an area of need for us?", "As an example, one of the things we’re always trying to do as a delivery organization is to learn better ways to activate and engage patients.", "That was also a common interest for Amgen. Based on that convergence, patient engagement has been a central theme of the partnership to date.", "AJMC®: When Amgen approached you, what was the process for making a partnership happen? Did it have to go up the ladder?", "Did others in your organization need selling or education around the details of a VBP?", "“Value-based model” is a description commonly used when discussing healthcare transformation, but in the delivery organization-pharma relationship space, how that model operates day to day is still very much a work-in-progress.", "The first phase of partnership development entailed introductory conversations about whether we had mutual areas of interest.", "That was followed by additional due diligence surrounding what a specific project would actually look like.", "Who would be involved? How would resources be allocated? What were the legal and compliance components to consider?", "Once we agreed on the program foundations, discussions became very granular in terms of logistics-contracting, deliverables, legal review, timelines, etc.", "The other fundamental question was, is this program research or is it more of an operational project?", "In our case, we felt this fell squarely into the operational, nonresearch space. After those structural pieces were in place, the emphasis shifted to pulling together a project work team and then executing.", "AJMC®: Okay, can you tell us a little bit about what your project team looked like, and what type of individual roles are involved?", "After making the determination that this was an operational project, we brought in other people from the organization involved with innovation and care transformation efforts.", "These included subject matter experts in primary care, care coordination, and patient education, as well as a data analyst and a project manager.", "That’s the core team on the BSWH side. This group interacts with other individuals across the organization on an as-needed basis in terms of reaching out to specific practice sites or obtaining perspectives from additional BSWH stakeholders.", "The BSWH core team works closely with a matching group on the Amgen side. My own connection to the project is a hybrid role, linking healthcare delivery science and operational improvement efforts.", "AJMC®: Can you describe specifically some of the projects that the organization and Amgen will undertake together?", "The collaborative work to date falls into several categories. First, we used data collected from normal BSWH care operations to characterize our population in terms of demographics, anti-hyperlipidemic use, and current LDL status.", "This real-world evidence informed our collaboration, with the end goal of designing a project to improve our understanding of potential care management options.", "The other component surrounds patient engagement. To better understand that aspect of lipid management—for example, what factors are most important to patients as far as lipid medication adherence?—we conducted a series of patient interviews.", "Insights from this phase of our partnership could be used to co-develop disease education resources, patient engagement resources, or other patient-focused content.", "The final formats of what we will do with that content are still to be determined.", "AJMC®: How will your organization and Amgen jointly make decisions as these projects unfold? If there are shifts or things that need to be addressed, is there a steering committee?", "What’s your communication structure like with Amgen for this program?", "We do have a program steering committee, and we work directly with 2 project leads at Amgen in that capacity.", "BSWH members include myself, a vice president in the BSWH Value-Based Healthcare Institute—our quality improvement consulting resource that works with external entities—and our system director of patient learning.", "AJMC®: What are the organizational goals and benefits that you’re expecting from this program?", "From the real-world evidence standpoint, with the array of new drug therapies coming onto the market, we are very interested in looking at net population benefits and total costs of care associated with those therapies, particularly when applied to environments similar to BSWH.", "I think there is a real opportunity for organizations to use their own data and work with industry partners to help answer those types of questions.", "The other area of interest is generating actionable data or new approaches for the health coaches and clinical care managers throughout our accountable care organization, as well as our outpatient practice networks.", "We really didn’t have anything specifically developed for patient engagement and activation in the lipid management space.", "We felt there were some opportunities to improve care delivery and any learnings or tools that we could develop for that condition would be of mutual benefit for the patients served by BSWH as well as our providers.", "I think that also highlights the difference between VBPs that emphasize shared knowledge generation versus value-based contracting.", "Historically, value-based contracting has often been a transactional arrangement driven by volume, where organizations purchase a certain amount of the drug and in return receive favorable pricing.", "That’s not what we’re setting up with Amgen. The partnership at this stage is really about laying some of the groundwork and conducting pilots to understand what the next generation of value-based agreements— for example, purchasing contracts with shared risk—and innovative care models to better serve patients might look like.", "AJMC®: So your work with Amgen on this project does not have to do with a contract that may affect pricing for drug acquisition?", "Correct. This partnership is not connected to any purchasing agreements. Again, at this stage, I view the partnership very much as a discovery and learning lab, generating pragmatic resources to help move the needle on clinical outcomes and providing insights.", "AJMC®: Would you suggest this model or offer any other advice for other types of organizations interested in this type of collaborative partnership?", "There is general acknowledgment that the market is going to evolve from fee-for-service to a predominantly value-based model.", "The timing and the specific mechanisms for how that’s going to happen are much less clear. There’s not really a standard organizational blueprint for how to make such a transition easily or quickly.", "That gap creates a situation where a joint learning partnership can provide a tremendous amount of value to the healthcare system.", "You can use the partnership as a rapid-cycle innovation environment to test new ideas, and it may lead you to some insights, information, or products that support better patient care or could improve healthcare outcomes overall that might not have been pursued otherwise.", "These types of partnerships can accelerate the discovery phase and move the healthcare system toward those value-based care approaches faster.", "On a high level, BSWH’s conception of value, like that of many organizations, is the relationship of quality versus cost of services provided, as well as access to those services.", "Within that framework of value, and specifically in the pharmacotherapy space, I think the concept of tailoring care and matching the right patient with the right treatment becomes very important.", "For example, is there a patient who might benefit from being on a specific medication therapy that’s not receiving it?", "This would be an underuse problem. Conversely, is a patient taking a medication which is unlikely to help their condition or has risks that outweigh potential benefits?", "This would be an overuse problem. Likewise, does a patient have access to their prescribed medication and are they taking it appropriately?", "Each of these scenarios impacts the relative value of pharmacotherapy.", "Other aspects of value relate to the things we do that benefit our patients’ experience and the efficiency of care delivery.", "Frequently, there is still significant equipoise in the value equation with novel therapies. For example, what’s the downstream impact of higher spending for a new drug on clinical and cost and outcomes, both to the patient and to the delivery organization?", "From a total cost-of-care perspective, it may be very reasonable to spend more on the front end of a longitudinal care episode, if, at a population level, it yields net tangible benefits.", "As mentioned previously, this type of analysis done at the local level represents a potent type of real-world evidence.", "Lastly, value can depend on the perspective of who is doing the assessment. On the patient side, value could be a lower out-of-pocket cost for a therapy or a clinical outcome that improves quality of life or an ability to work.", "For a delivery organization or a payer, value may lie in determining initial cost of the therapy versus the total cost of care and the impact on the broader covered population.", "Everyone uses the term “value,” but it is often helpful to view the question through the lens of “value to whom?”1.", "CMS.

In the biotech sector, the top five innovators include Amyris, Omeros, Synthetic Genomics, Galapagos, and Amgen.", "With the exception of Amgen, I have to admit, I was unfamiliar with the other four companies listed.", "Interestingly, the top three were all founded within the past six years. I would not interpret this as an indicator that you have to be a relatively new start-up company to be considered innovative.", "Other companies listed as being innovative — Pepsi, GE, IBM — have stood the test of time. What I would conclude from this is you don’t have to have an unlimited R&D budget to be successful at innovation.", "Perhaps, innovation can occur on a shoestring — of sorts.", "Consider, for example, California-based Amyris (NASDAQ: AMRS), the top-ranked innovative company in the biotech sector.", "The company’s annual report states, “We devote substantial resources to our research and development efforts.”", "Here is what it considers substantial. For year-end 2010, Amyris had R&D expenditures of approximately $55.2 million.", "One of the other top innovative companies, Seattle-based Omeros (NASDAQ: OMER), uses rigorous project management techniques to assist in making strategic R&D program decisions with its 2010 budget, which tips the scales at just under $23.5 million.", "Even Rockefeller University, one of the foremost biomedical research centers in the world, which has averaged one Nobel Prize every four years for the last six decades, and one National Medal of Science Award (NMSA) every three years, maintains its level of innovation with research budgets of less than $250 million.", "But, can we really use the word shoestring to describe R&D budgets in the millions of dollars? It all depends on the context.", "Consider this: Pfizer announced in February it would be cutting its R&D budget by $1.5 BILLION! Meanwhile, Merck is forecasting to spend about $8.5 billion for 2011.", "Interestingly, both of these companies were absent from more than one published “most innovative companies” 2011 lists.", "John Lechleiter, Ph.D., chairman, president and CEO of Eli Lilly (NYSE: LLY), recently outlined two imperatives to bolster the future of R&D in the pharmaceutical industry and stimulate the global economy.", "The first is changing the way companies conduct research, or as he likes to call it, “re-inventing invention.”", "Second, he recommends that government implement public policies promoting an innovative environment. This appears to already be happening.", "In January, the U.S. government announced the creation of the National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences, an initiative to reverse the slowing pace at which new drugs are being brought to market by the pharmaceutical industry.", "The new billion-dollar drug development center is the brainchild of Francis Collins, M.D., Ph.D., director of the National Institutes of Health (NIH).", "In the announcement, Collins stressed that this is not intended to be competitive with the private sector.", "“I believe a little healthy competitition is important for innovation.”", "Collins’ previous experience serves as a great example. No stranger to competition, he competed against rival biologist Craig Venter in a race of public-versus-private-sector research to successfully map the human genome.", "With Collins at the helm, the human genome project (HGP) is credited with attaining several milestones, running ahead of schedule and under budget.", "I would argue that the initial competition between these two influential geneticists, and their eventual cooperation, should be credited for this monumental innovation being completed under budget and ahead of schedule.", "It seems obvious that unlimited R&D budgets are not necessary for successful innovation. Conversely, competition and government support are integral components of the process.", "What are some of the other key ingredients? To identify these, I recently interviewed a cross section of individuals actively involved in innovation within the biopharmaceutical industry.", "Bernard Munos is the founder of the InnoThink Center for Research in Biomedical Innovation. Previously, he was advisor in corporate strategy at Eli Lilly, where he focused on disruptive innovation and the radical redesign of the R&D model.", "Munos is a firm believer that the recent lack of innovation in the biopharmaceutical industry is a result of companies getting away from the entrepreneurial, visionary, and imaginative “gut feel” spirit that had made them so successful since the industry’s inception.", "“Companies successful at innovation identify the gaps that exist in the market and go out and create the new technology needed in order to fill those gaps,” he said.", "The keys to effective gap analysis are the people. “The real innovators, typically, are people who see things other people don’t.", "This ability places them in a very small minority.” According to Munos, these people tend to be passionate advocates for disruptive ideas.", "In a large organization, this creates tension for the majority, who tend to be advocates for the status quo.", "As a result of the frustration these people experience, and/or cause, typically, they are either let go by large organizations or strike out on their own, as was the case with Craig Venter.", "Jeff Chulay, M.D. is the chief medical officer for Applied Genetic Technologies Corp. (AGTC), a clinical stage biotech company using recombinant adeno-associated virus (AAV) technology to develop gene therapy treatments for a variety of genetic diseases.", "A self-described “impossible dreamer,” Chulay has been involved in grand challenges, including working on Malaria and HIV vaccines.", "“I tend to be a doer. I enjoy working on important problems where technology can have a real big impact.", "I enjoy learning new things.” One of Chulay’s favorite phrases is the paradox of “conventional wisdom.”", "Once something is labeled as such, people do not challenge that a well-known fact may not be true. Chulay believes that if you want to get more innovation, “You have to have an open mind to new ideas that fly in the face of conventional wisdom.”", "Executive VP of Business Development at Exelixis, Fran Heller, sees innovation as more of a leadership style and mindset.", "She states, “You can’t say — today — I will innovate! It is not as easy to conjure up as everyone would like it to be.”", "Heller explains, “Just about every conference I have attended involves a panel discussion where a presenter will invoke the well-worn phrase, ‘We need to be more innovative.’", "A more useful approach is to reveal the main ingredients to creating it, maintaining it, and instilling it, because we are all looking for innovation.”", "So, how do you find innovation and how do you get more of it?", "Chulay gave one example of how hiring and empowering employees who can recognize and act on an opportunity can lead to innovation.", "“Zyban is a product indicated for smoking cessation, but it is also the exact same compound known as Wellbutrin, an antidepressant,” Chulay explains.", "“When I was at GSK, one of the investigators at a VA Hospital evaluating Wellbutrin commented to the clinical trial monitor, ‘A lot of my patients who go on this drug say they’ve lost their taste for cigarettes.’", "The monitor went back and told the staff about this offhand observation. The team decided to collect some prospective data, and after a little exploratory analysis, they quickly realized they were onto something.", "So, they designed a study.” The innovation was having a person who, when provided with what to many might seem like innocuous information, perceived the value and did something with it.", "“I think it’s an example of the old saying, serendipity rewards a well prepared mind,” said Chulay. “If you discover a new fact, but you don’t have the background to put it in context, then it’s just one more little piece of trivia.”", "Prior to joining AGTC, Chulay worked for AlphaVax, where he soon became disenchanted stating “it was no longer a fun place to work.”", "So, he began looking for a new opportunity. “Even though I didn’t have a background in gene therapy, what AGTC was doing seemed interesting and exciting.", "That is what really drew me to the company.” Munos would concur with Chulay’s assessment of “fun” being a key ingredient to innovation.", "“I don’t think Steve Jobs, Bill Gates, or any of the other successful innovators had any clue where their work would eventually lead them,” Munos said.", "“Jobs started at HP and eventually left. The sheer thrill of innovating, of doing something new, of doing something cool, is more exciting than any corporate or university bureaucracy.”", "Munos believes you can get more innovation by empowering your employees. He explains that if you view innovation as an enterprise, there are only four questions to address.", "What is the focus? How do you staff and manage it? How do you fund it? How do you mitigate risk? Unfortunately, he believes the industry’s current and excessive spending pattern is geared toward incremental innovation.", "“It is easier. Companies need to re-embrace disruptive innovation and focus on finding breakthroughs,” he explains.", "Heller sees innovation as a responsibility of corporate leaders and their ability to provide an open environment where creativity can flourish.", "“If you are not allowed to roam a little bit and explore things that are atypical or unusual, then you’re very unlikely to find innovation.”", "The three individuals I interviewed for this article suggest the following as means of fostering innovation in your organization.", "First, recruit and retain the right people. Hire people who are “doers” rather than people who are good at directing others to go do something.", "Look for people with a willingness to step across boundaries and assume responsibility. For example, when Chulay was hired, after only a few months AGTC had to restructure.", "Instead of just being responsible for clinical, he assumed responsibility for regulatory and quality as well.", "Another means by which you can foster innovation is “spending wisely,” says Harris. This may seem counterintuitive, but here is why it works.", "If you have a promising compound, as in the case with recent data indicating Cabozantinib (XL 184) as Exelixis’ most promising compound, then it makes sense to put the resources where they will do the most good.", "Harris explains, “When you have to ask yourself, for every line item, ‘do we really need this?’ it focuses you on what is absolutely core to meeting the clinical and company objective.”", "In addition, it empowers employees to figure out creative ways to do more with less.", "Chulay provided an example of prudent spending. “I received bids from a couple of CRO to find out what the cost would be to do the various aspects of clinical trials.", "All of the estimates were three or four times my annual salary.” As a result, Chulay decided to do as much as he could himself.", "“I’ve done everything including set up the database, data entry, design the case report forms [CRFs] and review them with the study coordinators.", "I had the CRFs printed at Kinko’s and assembled them myself.” He admits he is able to do a lot of this because orphan disease clinical trials tend to be small.", "Nonetheless, he says, “It’s much more cost-effective for Phase 1 and 2 trials in the area I am researching, to do it all in-house.”", "Creating a campus-like atmosphere with Japanese gardens and espresso coffee bars is not, and never was, the answer to fostering innovation.", "One of Munos’ favorite examples on how to foster innovation is the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, DARPA.", "Credited with instrumental involvement in the development of the Internet, night vision, and GPS technology, this organization of 140 scientists operates primarily via networking.", "The DARPA model has resulted in incredible innovation, with a budget that is less than half of Pfizer.", "Some characteristics of this organization, which could be incorporated into pharmaceutical and biotechnology R&D, include few layers of management, as in two, and budget allocation focused on disruptive innovation.", "According to Munos, “DARPA cannot spend a penny on any idea that is not disruptive.” He believes that company research budgets should be “restricted exclusively to the funding of breakthroughs and everything else should be defunded.”", "In his remarks to the U.S./Japan Business Council, Lechleiter concluded, “Innovation is not a panacea for the challenges facing our economies and healthcare systems.", "But, it is hard to see any way out of the current crisis without innovation.” Just be prepared for resistance.", "Innovation necessitates change, a scary proposition for allies of the status quo.", "Grants can play a pivotal role in R&D successes. Amyris was the beneficiary of a $42.6 million five-year grant from the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation.", "Omeros received $5 million from the Life Sciences Discovery Fund of Washington State. AGTC received a couple of $1 million grants from the FDA Orphan Drugs Program.", "If writing grant requests is not an area of expertise within your organization, there are a variety of resources on the Internet that can get you started.", "The Better Business Bureau (BBB), as well as other sites, provide some ratings on grant writing companies.", "Go to http://goldengate.bbb.org to get started. Or, you could watch a short video on innovation by Scott Anthony, the managing director of Innosight, which is well worth 10 minutes of viewing.", "Go to You Tube and search, “Innovation on a Shoestring.”"]}

Indeed, Amgen emphasized \"particular\" and referred to its particular salts three times in the span of two pages.", "See J.A. 182–83. The Declaration attached to Amgen’s response also highlights and discusses the same particular combinations recited in Amgen’s claims.", "For example, the Declaration refers to sulfate/citrate and sulfate/acetate as \"particular dual salt combination[s]\" that resulted in increased dynamic capacity as compared to a single salt.", "J.A. 187. It also explains that using a sulfate/citrate, sulfate/acetate, or acetate/citrate combination (the only claimed combinations) resulted in reduced commercial manufacturing costs as compared to using only a single salt.", "See J.A. 187–88. Notably, Amgen’s response to the examiner’s office action quotes the Declaration’s conclusion that \"[u]se of this particular combination of salts greatly improves the cost-effectiveness of commercial manufacturing by reducing the number of cycles required for each harvest and reducing the processing time for each harvest.\"", "J.A. 183 (quoting J.A. 188 ¶ 4). Amgen’s response and Declaration do not mention any salt combinations other than those claimed.", "Based on Amgen’s statements during prosecution, we agree with the district court’s conclusion that \"a competitor would reasonably believe\" that Amgen surrendered unclaimed salt combinations.", "That Amgen made the same \"particular combination\" argument with respect to the same prior art reference as to salts claimed in the parent patent further reflects Amgen’s emphasis on the particular claimed combinations.", "Amgen argues that it did not distinguish Holtz on the basis that Holtz failed to disclose the particular claimed combinations, but rather, it distinguished Holtz on the basis that Holtz failed to disclose increasing dynamic capacity and failed to disclose any salt combinations at all.", "See Appellant Br. 30–36. According to Amgen, its statement regarding the \"particular combinations\" of salts \"simply observes (correctly) as a factual matter that Holtz does not disclose using combinations of salts in the first instance,\" and thus does not clearly and unmistakably surrender unclaimed salt pairs.", "In its January 6, 2011 response, Amgen asserted three bases for distinguishing Holtz: (1) \"[n]o combinations of salts [are] taught nor suggested in the Holtz et al. patent\"; (2) \"nor [are] the particular combinations of salts recited in the pending claims taught nor suggested in [Holtz],\"; and (3) \"[t]here is no description or suggestion in Holtz et al. for the use of any combination of salts to increase the dynamic capacity of a HIC.\"", "J.A. 182.

According to Amgen, the arguments made in its last response prior to allowance \"must be the focus of any argument-based estoppel analysis.\"", "Id. at 40. Our case law does not support this argument. We recognize that Amgen did not include the \"particular combinations\" ground in its August 22, 2011 response to the patent office.", "See J.A. 160–62. This does not mean, however, that Amgen’s prior statements are erased. There is no requirement that argument-based estoppel apply only to arguments made in the most recent submission before allowance.", "\"[C]lear assertions made during prosecution in support of patentability, whether or not actually required to secure allowance of the claim, may also create an estoppel[.]\"", "PODS , 484 F.3d at 1368 (quoting Southwall Techs. , 54 F.3d at 1583 ). We see nothing in Amgen’s final submission that disavows the clear and unmistakable surrender of unclaimed salt combinations made in Amgen’s January 6, 2011 response.", "Because we hold that prosecution history estoppel applies, we do not reach the issue of whether Amgen dedicated unclaimed salt combinations to the public.", "We have considered Amgen’s remaining arguments and find them unpersuasive. The district court did not err in determining that prosecution history estoppel bars Amgen from succeeding on its infringement claim under the doctrine of equivalents.", "Accordingly, we affirm the district court’s order dismissing Amgen’s complaint for failure to state a claim."]}

David Meline left his hometown of Owatonna for college and never looked back—that is, until he was tapped for a plumb job at 3M (he is now the company’s CFO).", "He met his wife, Barbara, in Africa. They traveled together, got married, and traveled some more as David leveraged his math skills into a glamorous globetrotting career.", "“By now, the world feels pretty small,” David says. Maybe that’s why Minneapolis seemed not such a stretch.", "Their then-teenage sons took to it right away. “The quality of life here is very nice,” says Barbara.", "For three years, the family rented a house while they scoured the city for a permanent residence. Lars Peterssen of Peterssen/Keller Architecture was recruited to help them, and when a house on Lake of the Isles that had been designed by the legendary architect Harry Wild Jones came on the market, he urged them to snap it up.", "Well, almost everything. On the plus side, Peterssen recalls, were “great bones and the best location in town.”", "The size was right, too, at just under 4,000 square feet. But whereas the first owners had nine children and probably half as many servants, David and Barbara are now empty nesters.", "Cubicle living isn’t their style. “Modern is what I grew up with,” She says simply", "The couple kept the original red-tile roof and cornices. The handsome cottage-style porch windows were falling apart, so near-identical new ones were custom made.", "Several decorative windows remain as well. Otherwise, the rule was everything goes.", "“It was a blessing, in a way, that the house had already undergone several remodels,” Peterssen says.", "“Even though it was designed by an important architect, the interior didn’t feel sacred.”", "Together with the project’s lead architect Kristine Anderson, Peterssen proposed replacing the interior’s Moorish-style, faux-stone finishes with a palette of pale gray and white.", "But the primary transformation involved bringing the large wraparound porch into the living and dining rooms.", "The original stone foundation extends to the edges of the porch, unusual for its time and fortuitous for the architects.", "Their design eliminated the brick walls dividing the porch and living room, and added steel supports in the beamed ceiling to carry the load.", "The new space is filled with sun in the daytime as well as glorious views of the lake to the east and the Kenilworth Lagoon to the south; it glows under its soft, new recessed lighting at night.", "A wall and doorway that divided the sitting and living rooms also came down, bringing in the northern light and giving this part of the much-enlarged space those spectacular views.", "A wall that had obscured a wrought-iron bannister leading upstairs also came down, and a new matching bannister balances the now-exposed steps.", "Floors of rift-sawn oak, notable for its fine-grained straight lines, flow from the front of the domino-shaped house to the back.", "The same wood forms the mantel of the sitting room’s wall-to-wall fireplace, which became an important focal point with its strong horizontal line.", "The gray-ribbed stone surround seems to float above blackened-steel panels on either side of the recessed fireplace.", "Steel shelves below the mantel show off, among other treasures, a pair of handsome ceramic pots made by the Melines’ artistic younger son, Michael, who hopes to become an architect.", "Bright colors are few but the more dramatic for it. Above the mantel hangs a fiery-hued painting the couple acquired in Vietnam.", "A classic midcentury armchair and ottoman are upholstered in lime green. Barbara loves the chair. David finds it uncomfortable.", "On everything else, the Melines are in perfect accord.", "Art Deco is among their many shared interests. Their collection includes a freestanding burled-maple bar with a fluted front and an exquisite sideboard flanked by a pair of Art Deco side chairs.", "Above the sideboard is a mirror with light fixtures of similar vintage on either side of it.", "The Melines’ global finds add warmth and whimsy. A comfy green-velvet upholstered English Art Deco chair made in the 1930s sprouts a pair of hinged side tables.", "An African bone and mahogany armchair mimics a seated person. A curvaceous chest of drawers in the sitting room, handcrafted for David in Kenya by an eccentric Dutchman, could have been the brainchild of Dr. Seuss.", "“It’s survived four continents,” says Barbara, who confesses to being a ferocious packer. “But we’ve never lost anything.”", "Not even two African pots, each weighing 200 pounds.", "Frosted-glass pocket doors open onto a state-of-the-art kitchen. Anderson and Peterssen had to think big to pare down this space, which formerly housed an angled island, a brick chimney, and a large pantry.", "Not anymore. The redesign made space for bookshelves and a small sitting area. The rest of the kitchen is all about food.", "David picked out the prep island’s smoky granite countertop. A slab of rift-sawn oak is mounted low enough on the island to seat four in comfortable and stylish armchairs instead of the usual stools.", "The kitchen’s upper cabinets are made of the same fine-grained oak. Barbara insisted on acid-etched frosted glass for the lowers and backsplash.", "“It’s easy to clean and doesn’t show fingerprints,” she explains. Extruded pulls complete the clean look.", "The couple’s devotion to the “Less is more” design philosophy had only one drawback: It created a bit of a storage problem.", "“Everywhere we could think of, we scavenged space,” Barbara says with a sly smile. Like a magician pulling a rabbit out of a hat, she opens a skinny door almost invisible to the naked eye.", "Behind the door is an exceptionally well-organized broom closet.", "Architecture: Kristine Anderson & Lars Peterssen of Peterssen/Keller Architecture"]}

A fair assessment of new migraine preventive treatments is incredibly important to patients, and needs to be framed carefully based on the unique patient experience, disease burden, and impact to society.", "Based on our review of ICER’s draft scope, our recommendations are as follows:", "1) Employ a patient-centered approach – the base-case should be the patient and employer perspective that factors in the missed work days and reduced productivity of migraine patients, as opposed to a payer perspective.", "2) Assess erenumab only in treatment-experienced patients – those who have tried and failed topiramate or propranolol as opposed to treatment-naïve patients.", "3) Factor in treatment discontinuation rates with currently available preventives in the analysis and in the impact on efficacy.", "4) Incorporate responder rates i.e., a fifty percent responder rate assesses the proportion of patients who saw their migraine days reduced by half or more.", "5) Apply full continuous modelling techniques rather than a fixed health state model to more accurately capture the complexities of migraine burden and treatment benefit.", "A more comprehensive discussion of these recommendations is below.", "ICER’s healthcare system perspective should not just reflect the payer perspective but be inclusive of all those who are incurring costs due to migraine, most notably the patient and employer.", "The adoption of a payer perspective, as opposed to a broader societal perspective, is at odds with established accepted methodologies in the economic evaluation of new treatments.1,2,3,4 The gold standard for health economic assessment methodology, the Second Panel on Cost-Effectiveness in Health and Medicine, recommends that all cost-effective analyses capture both the healthcare payer and the societal perspective (in this case, societal is defined as all costs incurred by society due to migraine, including the often overlooked costs to patients).5,6 These include, for example, patient co-payments for treatment, employer costs, and providers costs of services and transactions not covered by insurance.", "Moreover, there are higher overall total costs associated with this debilitating disease that impact the healthcare system including the impact on patient physical, psychological and social lives which are not captured in an assessment that is only payer centric.", "Patients with migraine have much higher average healthcare expenditures averaging 1.5 times matched controls.7 While these are high costs to the healthcare system, they are unlikely to be captured in ICER’s base-case.", "ICER’s current base-case leaves out one of the largest healthcare payers of migraine costs, the self-insured employer.", "Self-insured plans cover 83% of all employees at private sector companies with >200 employees.8 Each employee with frequent migraine costs employers as much as $13,000, a hidden cost representing nearly three times what individuals pay in insurance premiums.9,10,11 ICER should define the healthcare perspective as greater than the payer to be inclusive of all stakeholders (e.g., patients and employers): this more comprehensive approach will more accurately capture the full value of CGRP’s to patients.", "Failure to include a broader perspective may inadvertently lead to migraine being deprioritized over conditions that incur significant payer costs.", "Health economists have recommended this broader perspective for over 20 years12 to ensure that untreated conditions that incur very little comparative cost to payers are not deprioritized.", "Migraine qualifies as one of these as it is 1) extremely debilitating if left untreated 2) incurs little directly identifiable cost to the payer if left untreated and 3) may be more expensive to payers when effectively treated.", "Economists recognize that health as a merit good has benefits that go beyond the healthcare system that methodologically should be reflected in any economic evaluation, including migraine.13", "The use of a payer perspective as the base-case is biased against a fair evaluation of therapies to prevent migraines (such as CGRPs) as it fails to capture more than half of the value to patients.", "As emphasized in the Amgen open comment period response, on top of the non-payer incurred direct medical costs, there are also substantial costs that lie outside of the healthcare system.", "Highly debilitating, migraine causes sufferers to frequently miss work and be less productive while at work, costing employers, patients and society billions of dollars per year.14,15 Absenteeism accounts for 81%, short term disability 13%, and workers compensation 6% of costs from lost productivity due to migraine.16,17,18,19,20 ICER should use a broader healthcare system perspective, inclusive of the patient and employer, as their base-case.", "Additionally, we urge ICER to make all inputs, assumptions and data available and fully transparent –especially in the event that ICER chooses to run this as a separate scenario instead of a base-case.", "Erenumab should not be assessed in populations who are naïve to migraine preventive treatment. Patients that can gain disease control from currently available preventive treatments and who can persist on them, represents maximum value to both the patients and the healthcare system.", "Multiple clinical and insurer sources suggest that in clinical practice, erenumab will be used after failure of topiramate or propranolol, addressing the high unmet need of migraine patients who have experienced a lack of efficacy or tolerability from prior preventives.21,22,23,24,25 Further, in the U.S. ICER CTAF 2014 report, Botox® is reserved for CM patients who have failed topiramate or propranolol.26 In the U.S., this reinforces the place of CGRPs in preventive treatment-experienced patients.", "Moreover, while ICER recommends topiramate and propranolol, the evidence on these interventions is not directly comparable to the evidence on erenumab.", "Studies are not comparable in terms of population, definition of endpoints and other study design elements, which weakens the comparative efficacy estimation.27,28,29,30", "Erenumab has been shown to benefit treatment experienced patient populations including those who have failed prior treatment (including topiramate and propranolol).", "Erenumab is an investigational migraine preventive that has demonstrated sustained efficacy specifically in these patients in clinical trials.31,32 It is of paramount importance that ICER’s assessment address the unmet needs of patients who have not benefited from currently available preventive treatments.", "If ICER were to assess erenumab in all patients, this is not aligned with how these treatments are expected to be used in real world practice.", "It may inadvertently restrict access in patients who will benefit the most and undermine the potential value of these innovative treatments.", "There are several ways to model the economics of migraine prevention with CGRPS. In treatment experienced patients, one way is to model all patients with > 4 migraines days per month.", "In this case, the appropriate comparator for erenumab in the patient populations who have tried and failed topiramate or propranolol is ‘no preventive treatment’.", "Based on ICER’s prior report on Chronic Migraine, ICER may choose to model EM and CM separately, in which case based on ICER’s prior analysis, Botox in CM may be the comparator for the CM population.", "What is known, is that there is currently no defined standard of care for patients with > 4 migraines per month who have tried and failed topiramate or propranolol.", "Additionally, there are no clinical trials or observational cohort data that are available or published with propranolol33 or topiramate 34,35,36,37,38,39 in patients who have tried and failed these treatments.", "As such, neither topiramate nor propranolol are appropriate comparators in preventive treatment experienced patients with 4 or more migraine days per month.", "An adequate therapeutic trial with preventive therapy is approximately 2-3 months based on treatment guidelines for prevention.40,41 Requiring failure of multiple classes of therapies for 18-24 months is overly burdensome to patients and is not supported by available evidence.42,43,44 Treatment guidelines, published sources, real-world and clinical practice data do not to support this approach.45 The time a patient tries a treatment can be short, reflected in persistence rates.", "Annual persistence rates with current preventive therapies is low: 50% of patients discontinue treatment at one month, 70-75% by month 6.46 In another study, similar trends were observed at month 12.47 Given that there are no data in a robust controlled setting or in current clinical practice that support a treatment paradigm of patients requiring failure of multiple classes, ICER should evaluate erenumab in migraine patients after failure of topiramate or propranolol with an adequate therapeutic trial.", "Discontinuation rates and poor adherence must be accurately captured since patients can only derive continued benefit when they persist with therapy.", "Adherence is a fundamental driver of value.48,49 Despite discontinuation of preventive migraine medications, acute medication use persists.50 While acute medication use is observed to decrease in the 30 days after discontinuation of the index preventive, acute medication use rebounds to pre-preventive usage in the 31-90 days after discontinuation.51 ICER should ensure that they accurately account for and measure discontinuation rates in all treatments as they have a significant impact on efficacy in clinical practice.", "Failure to capture this accurately would significantly underestimate the value of CGRPs.", "Per guidelines, RR is a key measure of preventive treatment success.52 Odds ratio (OR) and confidence interval (CI) relative to placebo, in all comers for erenumab 140-mg in EM was 2.81 (2.01 to 3.94) 53 and in CM 2.3 (1.6, 3.5).", "54 In treatment experienced patients with >1 prior treatment failures, OR relative to placebo, in EM was 3.06 (1.70, 5.52) 55 and in CM was 3.30 (1.98, 5.51)56, nominal p<0.001.", "ICER should reflect RR as an important outcome measure since it accurately captures a with-in patient response.", "In a study comparing the modeling of migraine preventives using a health state approach versus a continuous approach, parametric continuous distributions provide more accurate approximations of migraine day frequency.57 ICER should use a continuous distribution approach rather than a “health state” approach to more accurately capture migraine day frequency.", "The migraine prevention space has had no real innovation in two decades and patients are in need of new treatment options.", "As ICER has accurately reflected, migraine is one of the most debilitating diseases in the world. Its profound effects, which impact every facet of patients’ lives, are frequently underestimated.", "Current preventive treatment options are suboptimal for many patients. We recommend that ICER focus on areas where CGRPs are more likely to be used in real world clinical practice: those migraine patients that do not have available treatments that work.", "Moreover, ICER should ensure that its assessment of value is inclusive of all stakeholders, not just healthcare payers, by incorporating a more comprehensive healthcare system and societal perspective in order to capture migraine costs that CGRPs could alleviate.", "At this time, we are also providing a supplemental data appendix with further data to support our comments here.", "- Cost-Effectiveness in Health and Medicine.

Horn and R.D. Wells in Federation Proceedings Abstracts, Vol. 38, No. 3, 1979.", "The deadline for Biogen's reply brief was November 13, 1995. On November 9, 1995, Biogen filed an emergency motion to extend the time for a reply.", "Biogen pointed out that several of the claims on which Amgen sought summary judgment were subjects of this pending motion to dismiss.", "Biogen also asserted that it needed limited discovery to adequately prepare an opposition. Specifically, Biogen sought documents related to the Horn and Wells paper and the scholarly works it referred to, as well as any Amgen documents relating to the '702 patent.", "At the November 30, 1995 hearing, Biogen's motion for an extension was ALLOWED.

The Declaratory Judgment Act provides redress to victims of such tactics by forcing the patent holder to either prove its claim in court or permanently desist from threatening suit.", "When a patent consists of a single claim, the import of a declaratory judgment action is clear — it is, quite literally, an all or nothing proposition.", "Similarly, when the holder of a patent with multiple claims alleges that a product infringes only certain claims of its patent, the entire patent may be said to be in dispute if a resolution of the claims in controversy will still leave the defendant in doubt as to whether it is manufacturing an infringing product.", "See Flakice Corp. v. Liquid Freeze Corp., 131 F. Supp. 599, 600-601 (N.D.Cal. 1955). However, because a federal court's power to resolve disputes is limited to actual controversies, Spectronics Corp. v. H.B. Fuller Co., Inc., 940 F.2d 631 (Fed.", "Cir. 1991), the Flakice analysis is only applicable to patent cases when an adjudication of the claims pressed by the plaintiff necessitates a resolution of nonasserted patent claims.", "When this is not the case, the party seeking a declaratory judgment \"has the burden of establishing by a preponderance of the evidence . . .", "that it has a reasonable apprehension that it will be sued\" on the nonasserted claims.

In other words, Amgen claims that Biogen is cognizant of the fact that it behaved improperly in obtaining and seeking to enforce certain of the '702 patent claims, and as a result is seeking to weasel out of litigation that might place its entire patent in jeopardy.", "A finding of nonjurisdiction over the counterclaim does not, however, preclude Amgen from contesting the enforceability of the '702 patent.", "See Scripps Clinic and Research Foundation v. Genentech Inc., 707 F.

Aetna Life Ins. Co. v. Haworth, 300 U.S. 227, 240, 57 S.Ct. 461, 463, 81 L.Ed. 617 (1936) (distinguishing a \"justiciable controversy . .", ". from a difference or dispute of a hypothetical or abstract character.\") The reason that a conservative approach to jurisdiction is not unfair lies in the significant difference between a claim of unenforceability and a claim of invalidity.", "An inequitable conduct defense is directed to the former, and is not dependent on the ability to litigate the latter.", "See Webb, 742 F.2d at 1400 n. 8, noting that \"when the proof at trial establishes . . . fraud,\" a court declining declaratory judgment jurisdiction over nonasserted claims may nonetheless enter \"a declaratory judgment that all claims are invalid.\"", "Amgen next argues that because all of the patent claims are closely related, Biogen, by pressing some, has placed them all \"in play.\"", "The notion that a plaintiff's choice to litigate certain patent claims and not others constitutes assent to jurisdiction over the entire patent has been specifically rejected by the Federal Circuit.", "In Webb, 742 F.2d 1388, a leading case, the plaintiff asserted selected claims of its patent against the defendant.", "As here, the defendant counterclaimed for a declaratory judgment of invalidity as to the asserted claims and also as to several nonasserted claims.", "In Webb, the district court held that the nonasserted claims were invalid. The Federal Circuit reversed, holding that the defendant had failed to establish the existence of a case or controversy with respect to those claims.", "Amgen argues that, at a minimum, claims 1 and 2 of the '702 patent must be considered part of the existing case or controversy because asserted claims depend from them.", "See Memorandum in Opposition, at 10. In other words, Amgen contends that since nonasserted claims 1 and 2 of the patent must be addressed in order to resolve asserted claim 9, the court must exert jurisdiction over the former to exercise full jurisdiction over the latter.", "Despite its logical appeal, Amgen's argument is untenable in light of 35 U.S.C. § 282, which states that \"[e]ach claim of a patent (whether in independent, dependent, or multiple dependent form) shall be presumed valid independently of the validity of other claims. . . .\"", "Thus, while in Carroll Touch, Inc. v. Electro Mechanical Systems, Inc., 15 F.3d 1573 (Fed. Cir. 1993), the Federal Circuit acknowledged that to prove infringement of an asserted, dependent claim, a plaintiff must also demonstrate infringement of the nonasserted independent claim from which it depends, it nonetheless vacated the judgment of the district court because the independent claims were not asserted by the patentee and were not a part of the case in controversy.", "Id. at 1581 n. 8. While Amgen correctly quotes Wahpeton Canvas Co., Inc. v. Frontier, Inc., 870 F.2d 1546, 1553 (Fed.", "Cir. 1989), as saying that \"dependent claims cannot be found infringed unless the claims from which they depend have been found to have been infringed . .", ".,\" this principle does not expand the court's declaratory judgment jurisdiction. As the Webb court explained, \"[a] judgment, such as the one in the instant case, that adjudicated less than all of a patentee's claims may operate as collateral estoppel under certain circumstances to prevent that patentee from later charging the alleged infringer or a third party with infringement of the nonasserted claims.\"", "Webb, 742 F.2d at 1399. In this way, an alleged infringer need not inject every claim of a patent into the case in order to protect itself from repetitive law suits.", "Amgen similarly argues for jurisdiction over claim 12, from which claim 13 depends, but in light of Biogen's forbearance from suit on claim 13, the argument is no longer viable.", "Amgen's argument that the Webb court \"found a case or controversy as to [independent claims 4 and 8] . . .", "because claim 9, which the plaintiff had originally asserted against the defendant, was dependent on claims 4 and 8\" is based on a misreading of the opinion.", "See Amgen's Memorandum in Opposition at 7. The Webb court exerted jurisdiction over claims 4 and 8 not because of their relationship to an asserted claim, but because the plaintiffs \"actually litigated [them] without objection\" at trial.", "Amgen finally argues that the broad allegations of infringement levelled by Biogen in the original Complaint are sufficient to cause it reasonable apprehension that it is a target for suit with respect to all of the claims in the '702 patent.", "In response, Biogen points to its repeated promises to abstain from ever suing on the nonasserted claims.", "Biogen's initial assurance that it \"[did] not intend to assert\" any additional claims of the '702 patent against Amgen was correctly perceived by Amgen as falling short of an unconditional promise to forgo future law suits.", "See Memorandum in Support, at 7. However, in its July 24, 1995 reply brief, Biogen made the following representation:", "Amgen insists that it will accept only a stipulation that the nonasserted claims have not been infringed.", "Biogen correctly points out that such a stipulation would prevent it from litigating those asserted claims which depend from the nonasserted claims.", "See Wahpeton Canvas, 870 F.2d at 1553 n. 9. (\"One who does not infringe an independent claim cannot infringe a claim dependent on (and thus containing all of the limitations of) that claim.\")", "In an effort to resolve this jurisdictional dispute and to reduce the issues for trial, Biogen has offered to limit its assertion of the '702 patent to claims 9 and 17 — the filled vector claims.", "At the same time, Biogen has offered to stipulate that it will not sue Amgen on any of the remaining '702 patent claims (i.e., claims 1-8, 10-16 and 18) against any product currently manufactured and sold by Amgen (Haley Decl., Exh.", "This offer, if accepted, would limit the scope of discovery and trial because no \"empty vector\" claims would be at issue.", "This offer the court perceives as a binding undertaking that addresses Amgen's concerns. Amgen resists this declaration with the assertion that the temporal focus of the reasonable apprehension of suit analysis is ordinarily fixed on the day the Complaint is brought.", "See Arrowhead, 846 F.2d at 736. Amgen has failed, however, to cite any authority for the proposition that once the test has been met, the court must retain declaratory judgment jurisdiction even if the apprehension of suit subsequently evaporates.", "Logic, as well as the law, dictates that \"`an actual controversy must be extant at all stages of review, not merely at the time the complaint is filed.'\"", "Webb, 742 F.2d at 1398 n. 6, quoting Preiser v.

Praluent, a similar drug made by drug firms Sanofi and Regeneron, had sales of just $116 million.", "The hope among investors and cardiologists was be that this 27,564-patient study, presented this morning at the annual meeting of the American College of Cardiology in Washington, D.C., and published in the New England Journal of Medicine, would blow the barriers that keep patients from getting PCSK9 drugs.", "Now doctors, patients and insurance companies still struggle with the question: is Repatha worth the money?", "It wasn’t just genetics that got expectations for PCSK9 drugs hot. Reducing LDL as much as Repatha did should have resulted in a 31% reduction in heart attacks and strokes, says Sekar Kathiresan, a cardiologist and geneticist at Massachusetts General Hospital.", "So why was the result only 15%? One reason is the measure of success Amgen chose. In order to get more statistical power in clinical trials, drug companies and cardiologists often lump “hard” measures like heart attacks, strokes and deaths together with less important but more common problems like being hospitalized for chest pain or needing a stent to open a clogged artery.", "Repatha reduced the rate of heart attacks 27%, from 4.6 in 100 patients to 3.4 in 100 patients.

For the reasons set forth below the Court hereby GRANTS the motion.", "The case shall be dismissed without prejudice. FACTUAL BACKGROUND On June 2, 2010, Monica Barbosa Ramos (“Plaintiff”) filed a complaint against Amgen for gender and national origin discrimination under Title VII along with several claims under local law.", "(Docket No. 1). She alleges she was terminated from her position unjustifiably as Senior disciplined Project and Manager treated after differently she was than male Dockets.Justia.com Civil No. 10-1486 (JAG) 2 employees.", "She posits that her supervisors also discriminated against her because she is Argentine. As stated above, Amgen filed a motion seeking an order from this Court compelling Plaintiff to arbitrate her claims and dismissing the case or, in the alternative, staying the case pending the outcome of litigation.", "It argues that as part of her employment offer packet, Plaintiff received an offer letter and a copy of an arbitration agreement.", "The offer letter indicates that the signing offer the is Mutual contingent, Agreement among to other things, upon her Arbitrate.", "(Docket No. 9-1, Exhibit 1, p. 4). Plaintiff filed a timely opposition to Amgen’s request. She argues that Amgen waived the arbitration defense because it did not allege it during the administrative proceedings before the Department of Labor Antidiscrimination Unit (“ADU”); that her claim under Act 80 of May 30, 1976, P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 29, § 129, is not waivable and, therefore, not subject to arbitration; that she had gone through back surgery immediately before receiving the job offer and she was pressured into signing all the documents without actual knowledge of what the consequences would be.", "(Docket No. 18). ANALYSIS Plaintiff first argues that Amgen waived the arbitration defense because it did not raise it before the ACU.", "The First Civil No. 10-1486 (JAG) 3 Circuit has stated that “an employer cannot waive its right to arbitration by failing to raise the arbitration defense with the EEOC or by failing to initiate arbitration during the pendency of the EEOC proceedings.”", "Marie v. Allied Home Mortg. Corp., 402 F.3d 1, 16 (1st Cir. 2005). The Court clearly stated, “[w]e hold only that an employer should not be forced to file for arbitration during an EEOC investigation by finding a waiver of its right to arbitrate if it does not make such a filing.”", "Id. at n.13. Therefore, the fact that Amgen did not raise the arbitration defense before the ADU does not constitute a waiver.", "The Court also disagrees with Plaintiff’s interpretation of Act 80. The fact that the Act states that the right an employee has to receive compensation if dismissed in violation of said law is nonwaivable, does not mean that an agreement to arbitrate all claims an employee might have against the employer is automatically illegal.", "Clearly, an employee does not waive a right he agrees to assert though arbitration. Plaintiff next contends that she had undergone surgery shortly before she was pressured into deciding whether to take Amgen’s employment offer.", "According to her, Amgen knew of the surgery and nonetheless told her she had only one week to decide whether to take the employment offer or reject it.", "She states that she “felt pressured to sign the agreement because otherwise I was going to lose the opportunity to take advantage of the Civil No. 10-1486 (JAG) 4 offer […]", "I was afraid someone else would be hired, and that thereafter the doors at Amgen were going to be closed to me forever.”", "(Docket No. 18-1). Based on the above, Plaintiff posits that she entered into the arbitration agreement subject to undue pressure and influence.", "“When deciding whether the parties agreed to arbitrate a certain matter […], courts generally […] should apply ordinary state-law principles that govern the formation of contracts.”", "Dialysis Access Ctr., LLC v. RMS Lifeline, Inc., 638 F.3d 367, 376 (1st Cir. 2011) (quoting First Options v.

In this case Plaintiff has not alleged any facts that could lead this Court to consider that she signed the arbitration agreement by error, violence, intimidation or deceit.", "In fact, she clearly states that she was afraid of losing the array of benefits she was being offered.", "It is noted that she had a $77,000 a year employment with another company and decided to accept Amgen’s offer of a $92,000 a year salary (no", "Some case metadata and case summaries were written with the help of AI, which can produce inaccuracies.", "should read the full case before relying on it for legal research purposes.", "This site is protected by reCAPTCHA and the Google"]}

Three of the 5 services that were easiest to order were low value, and 3 high-value services were among the most difficult to order.", "Conclusions: In EHR systems used nationwide, no association existed between the clinical value of a service and the ease of ordering.", "This disconnect suggests that EHR redesign can significantly improve clinician workflow to facilitate the use of more high-value care and fewer low-value services.", "Am J Manag Care. 2019;25(10):517-520Takeaway Points", "Electronic health record (EHR) systems currently are not designed to allow for the efficient ordering of high-value clinical services.", "Our study evaluates if higher-value services are easier than low-value services to order.", "Three-quarters of Americans feel that the United States does not get good value from its healthcare spending.", "This concern is partially driven by the systematic underuse of high-value care, coupled with the widespread provision of medical care services that do not improve patient-centered outcomes.1 One proposed strategy to enhance efficiency is the use of electronic health records (EHRs).", "Since the passage of the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act in 2009, EHR systems have become nearly ubiquitous in US health systems.2 EHR adoption was intended to both decrease costs and improve patient-centered outcomes via the use of clinical support tools, medication reconciliation, reduced duplication of services, and enhanced patient—provider communication.3 Although recent study results have demonstrated that EHR implementation has led to improvements in guideline adherence, patient satisfaction, and medical spending,4-6 the totality of available data is mixed.4", "Given that every aspect of an EHR is subject to human design, there is ample opportunity to create a system that encourages high-value care.", "Informed by the field of behavioral economics, which seeks to understand the rationality behind seemingly irrational human behaviors, several other studies have examined the inherent design of EHRs.", "For example, one nationwide survey of emergency departments looked at the default number of pills when a provider prescribed an opiate and noted default pill numbers as high as 90 tablets.7 Another study developed various “nudges” within the EHR to encourage less-intensive glycated hemoglobin (A1C) targets in appropriate patients.8", "Our study sought to evaluate whether any EHR system appears to be designed to facilitate the ordering of higher-value care.", "A behavioral economics model would suggest that making higher-value care easier to order would provide an intrinsic incentive to deliver this care.", "However, we suspect that most current EHR systems do not facilitate efficient ordering behavior. Accordingly, the aim of this study was to quantify the ease of EHR ordering of specified high-value and low-value services.", "From April to June 2018, a survey was sent to medical institutions to identify a sample of EHR systems.", "Prior to the survey being sent, the study was approved for institutional review board (IRB) exemption by the Michigan Medicine institutional IRB.", "Respondents who agreed to participate in the study were sent a standardized form that listed 5 high-value and 5 low-value services that would be frequently ordered in an outpatient primary care setting.", "Rationale for their inclusion was derived from published national guidelines (Table9-19). The services were listed in random order, in that the form did not specify whether the services were considered high or low value.", "Participants were instructed to count the number of EHR clicks required to order each of the services.", "When typing was required, it was predetermined that any typing would count as a single click, with the rationale being that number of characters typed would be highly variable among providers but that typing of any amount represented additional provider documentation.", "Participants from 7 medical institutions, representing 5 unique EHR systems (Epic, CPRS, Practice Fusion, Allscripts, and Cerner), were identified and agreed to complete the survey.", "Responses were received and included from 5 systems: 3 academic institutions, 1 Veterans Affairs hospital, and 1 community hospital.", "Nearly all order entries (47/50) required some typing in addition to clicking. Glucometers were ordered outside the EHR workflow in 2 systems; flu shots were ordered outside the EHR in 1 system.", "Little correlation was seen between the value of a service and ease of ordering (Figure). Of the 5 easiest services to order, 2 were designated high value (flu shot [9.0 clicks], A1C testing [9.8 clicks]) and 3 were deemed low value (prostate-specific antigen screening [10.0 clicks], vitamin D screening [10.2 clicks], lumbar x-ray for back pain", "[11.2 clicks]). Similarly, of the 5 most difficult to order, 3 were designated as high value (glucometer [12.0 clicks], pulmonary rehabilitation [13.6 clicks], colonoscopy [13.6 clicks]) and 2 as low value (upper endoscopy for gastric reflux [14.4 clicks], computed tomography angiogram for coronary calcium [16.28 clicks]).", "Prior to the widespread adoption of EHRs, a proposed advantage of their adoption was to enhance provider efficiency.", "Our study sought to quantify the degree to which current EHR systems are designed to enhance the efficiency of providing high-value care.", "Based on our findings of a national sampling of EHR systems, representing nearly two-thirds of EHR users in hospitals,20 there was little correlation between the ease of ordering a particular clinical service and the strength of the evidence guiding the rationale for its use.", "Additionally, most of the high-value services required typing in all EHRs, which may further slow clinician workflow.", "EHR vendors have promoted tools such as best practice advisories and other similar alerts to increase utilization of high-value services and reduce low-value care.21 Our study did attempt to quantify the use of these alerts, but only 2 systems were noted to contain any alerts for the given services.", "Therefore, although these alerts may provide useful clinical reminders,6 they do not appear to be a widespread tool for supporting high-value care based on our findings.", "Moreover, an increased reliance on alerts and reminders may increase alert fatigue and provider frustration with EHR systems.22 Results from several studies demonstrate that current EHR systems have increased clerical burden and frustration for clinicians and that this increased burden is associated with higher rates of burnout.23,24 Simplifying the ordering process for clinicians who are ordering established high-value services could decrease the workload for these clinicians as well as incentivize higher-value care by other clinicians.", "Our study does have several limitations, including that not all EHR systems are represented. Additionally, we looked only at a small fraction of potential orders available to a primary care provider.", "Further, our study evaluated the ability to order services through a standard ordering process.

Furthermore, due to the distribution of ROIC-WACC across the sample firms being negative on aggregate, the increase in ROIC-WACC, which is still a negative figure, multiplied by a growing capital base, resulted in a decrease in aggregate EVA.", "This leads to the discussion of a critical invested capital growth rate, at which a given change in ROIC-WACC results in no change in EVA, and a discussion of how different firms have their EVA affected differently depending on their ROIC-WACC and Invested Capital growth rate.", "Keywords: Economic Value Added, Corporate Tax Rate, Cost of Capital, Invested Capital, Shareholder Value."]}
