As they are increasingly deployed, they will enable longer trips and encourage late adopters without access to private charging to purchase an electric vehicle.", "Most countries in Europe did not achieve 2020 AFID targets for publicly accessible chargers", "European countries for the most part failed to meet the recommended electric vehicle supply equipment (EVSE) per EV 2020 targets for publicly accessible chargers set by the Alternative Fuel Infrastructure Directive (AFID).", "However, there are wide disparities between countries.", "AFID, the key policy regulating the deployment of public electric EVSE in the European Union, recommended that member states aim for 1 public charger per 10 EVs, a ratio of 0.1 in 2020.", "In the European Union, the average public EVSE per EV ratio was 0.09 at the end of 2020. But that is not the whole story.", "The Netherlands and Italy are above the target at 0.22 and 0.13 respectively, with almost all being slow chargers, though fast chargers are 3% of the installations in the Netherlands and 9% in Italy.", "Countries with the highest EV penetration tend to have the lowest EVSE per EV ratios, such as Norway (0.03), Iceland (0.03) and Denmark (0.05).", "In these sparsely populated countries with many detached houses and private parking spaces, most EV owners can largely use private home charging.", "To a lesser extent, it also refects that the Nordic countries have a higher proportion of fast chargers, with shares of 40% in Iceland, 31% in Norway and 17% in Denmark.", "Ratio of public chargers per EV stock by country, 2020", "OpenPlanning needs to start now for megachargers to enable long-distance trucking", "The roll-out of public charging infrastructure has so far mostly focused on serving electric light-duty vehicles.", "The electrification of heavy freight trucks (HFTs) is a longer term endeavour, with less than 40 electric HFTs on the road in 2020.", "HFTs require batteries with high capacity to meet their needs for heavy-duty cycles and long-range operations, and consequently they require high power charging.", "So far charging options for HFTs have tended to be early stage demonstrations, proof-of-concept activities and efforts to faciliate standardisation.", "Megachargers of 1 megawatt (MW) or more would be capable of charging trucks operating over long distances reasonably quickly.", "Long-term planning for megacharger infastructure is needed now to avoid negative impacts on the electrical grid.", "Some impact to grids is inevitable given the high power requirements of megachargers. Significant investment may be needed for grid reinforcements, modernisation, storage and integration with power systems.", "Planning and co-ordination among electricity generators, distribution system operators and megacharging operations are needed.", "Some efforts are underway to develop standards for megachargers. Working jointly, the CHAdeMO association and the China Electricity Council have developed an ultra-high power charging standard (up to 900 kW), called ChaoJi.", "A version up to 1.8 MW, called Ultra ChaoJi, is under development. In parallel, the CharIN initiative established a task force called the Megawatt Charging System Taskforce which aims to develop a new high power standard above 1 MW by 2023 for charging heavy-duty trucks, based on the combined charging system (CCS) standard.", "Prototype testing started in September 2020. Tesla announced in late 2020 that it is working with third-parties to develop a standard for megachargers that can be provided to Semi truck owners.", "Tesla is one of five to have submitted a design to CharIN.", "Industry experts addressing international standardisation are evaluating avenues to harmonise megacharger standards for mutual compatibility, in order to facilitate the roll-out of electric HFTs.", "There are also regional efforts to develop megacharging infrastructure. Underpinned with stimulus funding, Iberdrola, a Spanish multinational electric utility, has expressed interest in installing megacharger infrastructure in heavy-duty freight truck corridors in Spain by 2025.", "ElaadNL (EV knowledge centre of Dutch grid operators), along with local and national government entities, in September 2021 launched an open-access test centre for companies and academia that offers test facilities for megachargers.", "In the United States, the West Coast Clean Transit Corridor Initiative aims to install charging sites capable of charging HDTs at 2 MW along key transit corridors from Mexico to the boder with Canada by 2030.", "Electric HDVs data are derived from the Global Drive to Zero’s Zero Emission Technology Inventory (ZETI) which is a regularly updated tool that offers a detailed glimpse of announced OEM production model timelines.", "ZETI data are meant to support fleet operators and policy makers and should not be construed as representative of the entire vehicle market.", "Electric HDVs data are derived from the Global Drive to Zero’s Zero Emission Technology Inventory (ZETI) which is a regularly updated tool that offers a detailed glimpse of announced OEM production model timelines.", "ZETI data are meant to support fleet operators and policy makers and should not be construed as representative of the entire vehicle market."]}

The largest contributor is an increase to Florida’s five-year outlook from 6.0 GWdc to 9.0 GWdc due to new solar procurement by Florida Power & Light (FPL), Duke Energy Florida, and other Florida utilities (most of which is utility self-build).", "This positions Florida to be the top state for utility PV over the next six years.", "Since last quarter, the 2019 forecast has grown by 1.2 GW, due largely to late project announcements in Texas that raised the state’s forecast by 720 MWdc.", "While the forecast for 2020 saw little change to overall expected capacity additions, over 10.0 GWdc of utility PV are still expected to come online that year.", "From 2021-2023, our utility PV forecast has increased by 2.8 GWdc. While the bulk of this increase is found in Florida, there are a growing number of utilities such as Xcel Energy, Idaho Power and PacifiCorp, among others, announcing additional solar procurement, expedited coal plant retirement, or plans to achieve 50% to 100% renewable or carbon-free energy targets, all of which have boosted the midterm forecast.", "During this time, utility PV also becomes increasingly competitive with wind. As the wind-focused federal Production Tax Credit steps down, solar begins to fall below the cost of wind on a levelized cost of energy (LCOE) basis in many traditional wind states such as Illinois, Iowa, Kansas, Michigan and the Dakotas by the mid-2020s.", "(Wood Mackenzie’s LCOE calculations for solar take the ITC incentive into account.) This is likely not only to drive more solar procurement in wind-dominant regions of Midcontinent Independent System Operator and Southwest Power Pool, but also to make solar the preferred renewable technology for corporate offtakers.", "Oklahoma Gas & Electric’s recent RFP for solar-plus-storage is the first example of what is likely to be a trend in solar procurement in the Prairies and Midwest.", "Our 2024 forecast has also increased by 1.1 GWdc. Many utilities such as Dominion, Tennessee Valley Authority and FPL have outlined solar procurement plans for 2024 and beyond.", "Despite the ITC having fully stepped down to 10% by that time, utility PV will remain economically competitive with new-build wind and natural gas in many places.", "We employ a bottom-up modeling methodology to track and report national average PV system pricing for the major market segments.", "This methodology is based on tracked wholesale pricing of major solar components and data collected from interviews with major installers.", "In Q1 2019, system pricing fell in all market segments.

Commercial Building Electrification Poses Significant Costs and Limited Emissions Benefits in the Near Term", "Though its prospects improve as years progress after 2030, forced building electrification at present would impose significant equipment and operational costs upon businesses and public utilities yet would not significantly reduce greenhouse-gas emissions.", "Efforts to Force Electrification Too Quickly Will Not Immediately Reduce Emissions", "The draft benchmarking and performance standard bill does not prescribe any manner by which the buildings it concerns must reduce their energy intensity, but since electric equipment, particularly electric heat pumps, can be less energy-intensive, some building owners may see electrification (the transfer of a building’s power generation from on-site fossil-fuel equipment to an off-site electric utility) as an option for pursuing compliance.", "The Colorado GHG Pollution Reduction Roadmap stresses that building electrification will be a persistent object of state policy, too; according to the Roadmap, “very high levels of electrification [will be] needed to achieve the 2050 [emissions] goals.”", "Building electrification is already becoming more popular as technology advances and electric grids become cleaner, but the Roadmap's recommendations are designed to accelerate the trend in pursuit of the state’s long-term reduction goals.", "If building owners are artificially encouraged to electrify their properties before the technology exists to make it holistically desirable, they may install equipment before their existing equipment ends their life cycles or which will swiftly become outdated as innovation progresses.", "In 2019, emissions generated by electric utilities produced between 263% and 303% more emissions per equivalent unit of energy than each of the three building sectors (residential, commercial, and industrial).[vi]", "Those numbers shrink to 0% and turn negative after 2030 given the policy scenarios in the Roadmap, but the differences are not very big for several more years.", "Full electrification can reduce emissions by 29.6%, 50.9%, and 35.6% in the residential, commercial, and industrial building sectors, respectively, by 2040, under Roadmap policy projections.", "The true cost of achieving that is unclear, however, and if Colorado’s built environment were to fully-electrify sooner, in 2021, the state’s total emissions would be about 39 MMT CO2e—almost 35%—higher than they’re expected to be otherwise (the actual effect would be somewhat less severe than that, since electric equipment is more end-use energy-efficient than fossil-fuel equipment).", "Accelerating electrification to that degree would be disastrous to the pursuit of Colorado’s economy-wide emissions targets.", "In the Short Term, Colorado’s Electrical Grid Can Not Handle a Rapid Influx of Electricity Demand without Causing Rates to Increase Dramatically", "Though a similar report does not exist regarding the conversion of commercial buildings, recent analysis by Xcel Energy, Colorado’s largest electric utility, shows the full electrification of the residential sector would cost $7,000 per home today—over 9% of the state’s median household income.", "That cost drops significantly through next decade to a projected $2,500 per home by 2030.[vii]", "This high short-term cost of swift electrification would result from the extensive upgrades and expansions that the electric grid would have to undergo in order to support it.", "Electrification moves peak electricity demand from summer to winter, which would force utilities to either overhaul their operations or endure regular blackouts.", "According to the same report by Xcel, \"with aggressive electrification, the electric system could shift to a winter peak in the 2030s, possibly earlier, and even before then, the electric system could require more than 4,000 megawatts of new capacity to cover the increased demand—more than a 50% increase in the system’s capacity.\"", "The investment required to equip the grid to handle all the new demand would, naturally, cause customers’ electric rates to skyrocket.", "If residential electrification becomes mandatory for new builds, Xcel Energy's natural gas customers would pay $66 (about 6%) more for the service, annually, by 2030.", "If electrification is mandated for all, including existing, residences, those same annual prices would increase by $930vii—almost 88%.", "Though additional research by Xcel has not been publicized, it follows that large-scale electrification of new and existing commercial buildings would increase these costs as well.", "This would be very burdensome to the people of Colorado, especially those most-harmed by the ongoing recession.", "Electric Retrofitting May Not Be Feasible, or May Be Too Costly, for Some Buildings", "Building electrification will become easier and less expensive over time, but, for now, it remains prohibitively expensive for some buildings and completely impossible for others.", "Some building uses are technologically easier to electrify than others (the requisite technology for agricultural and industrial electrification is many years off, for example), and cold-weather electric heating technology is still relatively infantile.", "According to Xcel, “the value proposition of electrifying...improves starting in the mid-2020s as commercially available electric technologies for space and water heating and other appliances become more efficient and as Xcel Energy’s electric system becomes less carbon intensive.\"", "Existing technology is not wholly sufficient to ensure the enduring efficacy of high-tech electrical equipment, so forced electrification imposes a high risk of equipment obsolescence upon compliant buildings.", "Operators unaccustomed to electric systems, additionally, will have to undergo potentially years of re-training in order to learn how to operate them efficiently.", "If building owners are artificially encouraged to electrify their properties before the technology exists to make it holistically desirable, they may install equipment which will swiftly become less initially expensive as innovation progresses.", "3.

these together will require extensive labor and administration which taxpayers will have to fund.", "Energize Denver, a benchmarking program limited to Denver’s city limits and which does not enforce performance standards, cost $1.3m of public money in 2020;[viii] a statewide requirement which includes performance standards stands to cost much more than this.", "It is important that regulators understand and consider the costs as they decide whether and how to implement legislation.", "No fiscal cost estimate of the draft bill has yet been developed, and legislators should be wary of saddling taxpayers with indefinite costs.", "Building Benchmarking Alone Could Be Beneficial to the State Government and the Private Sector Before Regulators Set Performance Standards", "Because of the uncertainty of the costs of draft-bill compliance and the potentially-awkward timing of reduction mandates considering the short-term outlooks for electrification and demand-side management, a reasonable approach may be to gather information now through benchmarking, without the pressure of enforceable requirements, and delay imposing performance standards until the government understands Colorado’s building stock better and the electrical grid has had enough time to support an aggressive shift to electrification.", "A reporting requirement alone, in addition to providing regulators valuable information, can effectively heighten the environmental performances of buildings by forcing operators to gain thorough understandings of their buildings’ energy-use intensities and, thus, highlighting some ways by which they might reduce costly waste.", "In Denver, since the launch of Energize Denver’s benchmarking requirement, all building types except municipal and distribution (already the lowest-intensity category) have reduced their average energy-use intensity readings[ix]—owners who can definitively identify areas of opportunity for energy savings are easily motivated to act upon them.", "Without comprehensive data collected through reporting or some other means, understanding the aggregate economic impacts and net costs of this draft benchmarking bill is impossible—if businesses and ordinary taxpayers are to trust that such a program as this will not affect devastating unintended consequences upon some actors within the private sector, much more information ought to be presented.", "Once enough is understood about Colorado’s building sectors to begin developing reasonable performance standards, the guiding regulatory effort should be to prioritize targeting promising and cost-effective reductions and to avoid unintentionally penalizing buildings for outcomes out of their owners’ controls or the successes of others.", "Under the auspices of a prudent approach, buildings in Colorado can reduce their environmental impacts without overspending, and some may even benefit financially from it.", "A Survey of Commercial Building Owners and Operators Highlights Many of the Key Outstanding Questions and Concerns About How Mandates Will Impact their Businesses", "During the week of February 22th through February 26th, in coordination with Colorado Real Estate Alliance (CREA) and Building Jobs 4 Colorado, CSI conducted a survey to collect responses from large commercial building owners to better inform the understanding of potential impacts related to establishing emission and energy reduction mandates for covered properties.", "Energy-efficiency and emissions reductions are front-of-mind goals for any responsible building owner, both as good business decisions and as actions of responsible environmental stewardship.", "Though an effort to enforce the pursuit of these goals seems well-intentioned, closer evaluation finds that it can cause unpredictable and often devastating impacts.", "As there lacks much publicly available aggregate data about these issues, this survey was intended to gather that sort of information in a localized and qualitative, but hopefully informative, manner.", "The results displayed of questions 1 through 8 capture all survey respondents, and the featured responses to questions 9 through 11 were selected for completeness and insight from their respective pools of 108.", "All comments directly from survey respondents are presented unedited.", "[i] https://energyoffice.colorado.gov/climate-energy/ghg-pollution-reduction-roadmap", "[ii] Emissions data from Colorado’s GHG Inventory and E3;

The first, a southern leg, had already been completed and now runs between Cushing, Oklahoma, and Port Arthur, Texas.", "Opponents of this project—now called the Gulf Coast Pipeline—say that TC Energy took advantage of legal loopholes to push the pipeline through, obtaining authorization under a U.S. Army Corps of Engineers nationwide permit and dodging the more rigorous vetting process for individual permits, which requires public input.", "The second segment was the hotly contested 1,209-mile northern leg—a shortcut of sorts—that would have run from Hardisty, Alberta, through Montana and South Dakota to Steele City, Nebraska.", "In 2015, the U.S. State Department, under President Barack Obama, declined to grant the northern leg of the Keystone XL project the permit required to construct, maintain, and operate the pipeline across the U.S.–Canada border—a permit that President Trump later granted and President Biden once again revoked.", "Dirty energy lobbyists claimed developing tar sands would protect our national energy security and bring U.S. fuel prices down.", "But environmental reviews by both the Obama and Trump administrations concluded that the Keystone XL pipeline would not have lowered gasoline prices.", "NRDC and its partners also found the majority of Keystone XL oil would have been sent to markets overseas—aided by a 2015 reversal of a ban on crude oil exports.", "This lines up with an industry trend: Oil and gas companies are exporting 8.4 million barrels of crude oil and refined fuels every single day.", "That’s up nearly threefold from a decade ago, and an amount equal to 42 percent of our consumption. And these exports are more than 10 times the capacity of the proposed Keystone XL pipeline.", "Tar sands oil is thicker, more acidic, and more corrosive than lighter conventional crude, and this ups the likelihood that a pipeline carrying it will leak.", "Indeed, one study found that between 2007 and 2010, pipelines moving tar sands oil in Midwestern states spilled three times more per mile than the U.S. national average for pipelines carrying conventional crude.", "Since it first went into operation in 2010, TC Energy’s original Keystone Pipeline System has leaked more than a dozen times; one incident in North Dakota sent a 60-foot, 21,000-gallon geyser of tar sands oil spewing into the air.", "Less than two years before the project was finally pulled, the Keystone tar sands pipeline was temporarily shut down after a spill in North Dakota of reportedly more than 378,000 gallons in late October 2019.", "And the risk that Keystone XL would have spilled was heightened because of the extended time the pipe segments were left sitting outside in stockpiles.", "“A study published in early 2020, co-authored by TC Energy’s own scientists, found that the anti-corrosion coating on the project’s pipes was damaged from being stored outside and exposed to the elements for the last decade,” notes NRDC senior attorney Jaclyn Prange, who spent years working on KXL litigation.", "Complicating matters, leaks can be difficult to detect. And when tar sands oil does spill, it’s more difficult to clean up than conventional crude because it immediately sinks to the bottom of the waterway.", "People and wildlife coming into contact with tar sands oil are exposed to toxic chemicals, and rivers and wetland environments are at particular risk from a spill.", "(For evidence, note the 2010 tar sands oil spill in Kalamazoo River, Michigan, a disaster that cost Enbridge more than a billion dollars in cleanup fees and took six years to settle in court.)", "Keystone XL would have crossed agriculturally important and environmentally sensitive areas, including hundreds of rivers, streams, aquifers, and water bodies.", "One was Nebraska’s Ogallala Aquifer, which provides drinking water for millions as well as 30 percent of America’s irrigation water.", "A spill would have been devastating to the farms, ranches, and communities that depend on these crucial ecosystems.", "Even worse, building Keystone XL would have meant enduring those risks just to send the fuel to our overseas rivals—and the profits to Big Oil.", "All facets of the tar sands industry pose a threat to the environment. Its mines are a blight on Canada’s boreal, where mining operations dig up and flatten forests to access the oil below, destroying wildlife habitat and one of the world’s largest carbon sinks.", "The mining depletes and pollutes freshwater resources, creates massive ponds of toxic waste, and threatens the health and livelihood of the First Nations people who live near them.", "Refining the sticky black gunk produces piles of petroleum coke, a hazardous, coal-like by-product. What’s more, the whole process of getting the oil out and making it usable creates three to four times the carbon pollution of conventional crude extraction and processing.", "“This isn’t your grandfather’s typical oil,” says Anthony Swift, director of NRDC’s Canada project. “It’s nasty stuff.”", "A fully realized Keystone XL would have led to more mining of that “nasty stuff” by accelerating the pace at which it’s produced and transported.", "(Indeed, Keystone XL was viewed as an essential ingredient in the oil industry’s plans to triple tar sands production by 2030.)", "It would also have led to greater greenhouse gas emissions—which, the latest scientific reports makes clear, we simply can’t afford if we’re to avoid the most catastrophic climate impacts.", "The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) initially stated that, on a wells-to-wheels basis, tar sands oil emits 17 percent more carbon than other types of crude, but several years later, the State Department revised this number upward, stating that the emissions could be “5 percent to 20 percent higher than previously indicated.”", "That means burdening the planet with an extra 178.3 million metric tons of greenhouse gas emissions annually, the same impact as 38.5 million passenger vehicles or 45.8 coal-fired power plants.", "Finally, massive fossil fuel infrastructure investments like KXL undermine efforts to minimize global warming and prioritize clean energy like wind and solar.", "Leading climate scientist and former NASA researcher James Hansen has warned that fully exploiting Canada’s tar sands reserves by moving forward with these projects would mean “game over” for our climate.", "In short, tar sands oil represents no small threat to our environment, and our best stance against it, as the rallying cry goes, is to “keep it in the ground.”", "Opposition to Keystone XL centered on the devastating environmental consequences of the project. The pipeline faced more than a decade of sustained protests from environmental activists and organizations; Indigenous communities; religious leaders; and the farmers, ranchers, and business owners along its proposed route.", "One such protest, a historic act of civil disobedience outside the White House in August 2011, resulted in the arrest of more than 1,200 demonstrators.", "“This is not a pipeline to America,” said the late civil rights activist Julian Bond, among the many arrested.", "“It’s a pipeline through America, and it threatens to be a disaster for us if it leaks poisons on the way.”", "Leading scientists and economists came out in opposition to the project, in addition to unions and world leaders such as the Dalai Lama, Archbishop Desmond Tutu, and former president Jimmy Carter (together, these and other Nobel laureates have written letters against the project).", "In 2014, more than two million comments urging a rejection of the pipeline were submitted to the U.S. Department of State during a 30-day public comment period.", "But the groundswell of public protest was up against a formidable opponent–hundreds of millions spent on lobbying by the fossil fuel industry.", "In the two years leading up to the November 2014 midterm elections, the fossil fuel industry spent more than $721 million to court allies in Congress.", "When industry-friendly politicians took charge of both congressional houses in January 2015, their first order of business was to pass a bill to speed up approval of Keystone XL.", "(That effort failed.) Later, fossil fuel companies funnelled millions into Trump’s 2017 inauguration ceremony, days after which he brought the Keystone XL project back from the dead, and ramped up federal lobbying efforts in the first months of his administration.", "“So what if there’s no pipeline? Big Oil will find a way.”", "One of the central arguments made by pipeline pushers was that tar sands expansion will move forward with or without Keystone XL.", "This has proved to be untrue. Dealing in tar sands oil is an expensive endeavor. It’s costly both to produce and to ship, particularly by rail, which would be an alternative to Keystone XL.", "Indeed, moving crude by rail to the Gulf costs substantially more than moving it by pipe. For companies considering whether to invest in a long-lived tar sands project (which could last for 50 years), access to cheap pipeline capacity plays a major role in the decision to move forward or not.", "Without Keystone XL, the tar sands industry has been forced to cancel projects rather than shift to rail, subsequently leaving more of the earth’s dirtiest fuel in the ground where it belongs.", "The industry also falsely claimed that the pipeline would be a big source of jobs.", "When TC Energy said the pipeline would create nearly 119,000 jobs, a State Department report instead concluded the project would require fewer than 2,000 two-year construction jobs and that the number of full-time, permanent jobs would hover around 35 after construction.", "When the Obama administration refused to grant the cross-border permit necessary to build TC Energy’s Keystone XL oil pipeline in November 2015, it struck a blow against polluting powers and acknowledged the consensus on this misguided project from a wide swath of communities, experts, and organizations.", "The decision echoed a seven-year State Department review process with EPA input that concluded the pipeline would fail to serve national interests.", "Upon entering office, President Trump—with his pro-polluter cabinet of fossil fuel advocates, billionaires, and bankers—quickly demonstrated that his priorities differed.", "On his fourth day in office, Trump signed an executive order to allow Keystone XL to move forward. On March 28, 2017, his State Department illegally approved a cross-border permit for the pipeline, reversing the Obama administration’s prior determination that KXL would not serve the national interest.", "When that failed—thanks to a lawsuit brought by NRDC and other groups—Trump reissued the cross-border permit himself.", "“We would score a victory, and it would have huge ramifications for holding off construction at critical times,” says NRDC attorney Cecilia Segal, who has worked on KXL litigation since 2017.", "“But then the Trump administration would do something to undercut us outside of court.” The administration also attempted to issue other permits for the project, all based on flawed environmental analyses, eventually prompting more lawsuits, including two from NRDC and its allies.", "Opposition outside the courts was swift and strong as well. Farmers, ranchers, tribes, and conservation groups helped keep the project stalled for Trump’s full four years in office, despite his best efforts to expedite its approval.", "President Biden and the end of the Keystone XL pipeline", "Even as Trump and TC Energy tried to revive the pipeline, polls showed that a majority of Americans opposed it.", "The market case had also deteriorated. Low oil prices and increasing public concern over the climate led Shell, Exxon, Equinor (then Statoil), and Total to either sell their tar sands assets or whittle them down.", "Meanwhile, major new tar sands projects stopped moving forward, despite investments from the government of Alberta, Canada.", "For example, in 2020, Teck Resources withdrew its 10-year application to build the largest tar sands mine in history, citing growing concern surrounding climate change in global markets.", "On the campaign trail, Biden vowed to cancel the Keystone XL cross-border permit should he win the presidency—and on his first day in office, he made good on that promise.", "The revoked permit became the final nail in the pipeline’s coffin. By that point, Keystone XL faced an unfriendly administration, numerous legal challenges, declining oil prices, worsening climate impacts, and a growing movement of climate organizers—along the pipeline’s route and around the world—unwilling to look the other way.", "In June 2021, TC Energy announced that it was abandoning its plans for building the pipeline for good—putting an end to a fossil fuel project that had loomed over waterways, communities, and the climate for more than a decade.", "“Keystone XL was a terrible idea from the start,” Swift said. “It’s time to accelerate our transition to the clean energy sources that will power a prosperous future.”", "While the tar sands industry was once seen as an unbeatable opponent in a David-and-Goliath fight, the victory against Keystone XL shows that the tables have begun to turn–and that more power now lies with the advocates for climate justice than ever before.", "“The era of building fossil fuel pipelines without scrutiny of their potential impact on climate change and on local communities is over,” Swift says.", "This story was originally published on April 7, 2017, and has been updated with new information and links.", "This NRDC.org story is available for online republication by news media outlets or nonprofits under these conditions: The writer(s) must be credited with a byline; you must note prominently that the story was originally published by NRDC.org and link to the original; the story cannot be edited (beyond simple things such as grammar); you can’t resell the story in any form or grant republishing rights to other outlets; you can’t republish our material wholesale or automatically—you need to select stories individually; you can’t republish the photos or graphics on our site without specific permission; you should drop us a note to let us know when you’ve used one of our stories.", "The Desire to Stop Canadian Tar Sands Transcends Borders"]}

(NRI) will supply the six modular utility-scale batteries to be used in the Stapleton pilot.", "NRI will be building two 18-kW batteries, two 36-kW batteries and two 54-kW batteries, totaling approximately 850 kWh of capacity.", "The NRI system uses U.S.-made energy conversion components from Pika Energy, along with advanced lithium-ion batteries.", "While NRI sees the resiliency and redundancy of the Stapleton project’s systems as incredibly forward thinking, it also sees the pilot as an exciting opportunity to bring distributed storage resources one step closer to widespread adoption by using its control systems and fleet management software.", "The utility also looks forward to understanding the real-time power-quality management needed for a local grid with high PV generation.", "For the Stapleton pilot project, Xcel Energy also recruited six homeowners with rooftop solar systems on the feeder to participate in the in-home battery pilot project.", "Sunverge Energy is supplying the behind-the-meter batteries and control software. Homeowners participating in the pilot will keep the home battery storage system at no cost when the pilot is complete and enjoy the benefits of reliable backup battery power in the rare event of a grid outage.", "Sunverge’s cloud-based platform will enable Xcel Energy to control individual Sunverge storage systems and aggregate them into a virtual power plant.", "This modest investment in storage can translate into less need for feeder upgrades, or the ability to accommodate more solar energy on a feeder.", "The Stapleton pilot project is estimated to cost $4 million. The in-home batteries are scheduled to be installed and online in the spring.", "The utility-scale batteries are expected to be installed and live in the fall.", "Both projects will expand on the findings of Xcel Energy’s community energy storage project from the utility’s previous ICT program at the Solar Technology Acceleration Center (SolarTAC) in Aurora, Colorado.", "That project demonstrated how battery storage can help to integrate PV onto the grid by providing ramp rate control and smoothing of distributed solar generation.", "Beth Chacon is the director of grid storage and emerging technologies for Xcel Energy’s advanced grid intelligence and security initiative.", "She leads the battery efforts in the utility’s distribution area and oversees the Panasonic and Stapleton battery pilot projects.", "Chacon previously supported the environmental initiatives in the company’s environmental policy department."]}

It is possible that LAG-3 expression on iNKT cells directly regulates IL-10 production, but perhaps more likely that the relationship with IL-10 reflects cross-talk between iNKT cells and other IL-10-producing lymphocyte subsets such as Tregs or neutrophils, both of which can interact with iNKTs", "[67,68]. Given that IL-10 can correlate with viral load [69], it is also possible that this relationship reflects a dependence of LAG-3 expression on disease progression, although that seems less likely given the lack of correlation between LAG-3 and CD4 count in this cohort.", "Unlike Tim-3 [70], LAG-3 was not highly expressed on any NK cell subset. The differences in LAG-3 expression between NK subsets, however, warrant further investigation.", "Although LAG-3 expression was not elevated on CD56-CD16+ NK cells among HIV+ participants, its expression was highest on this subset among healthy controls.", "The expansion of this subset during HIV infection has been documented [71], and LAG-3 could contribute to the anergic phenotype observed among these cells.", "In contrast to the T cell, and to some extent NK cell, subsets, LAG-3 was expressed at moderate levels on iNKT cells, particularly among the HIV-infected participants.", "In some patients, up to 40% of the iNKT population was LAG-3+, raising the possibility that iNKT cell function may be regulated by LAG-3 to a greater extent than other lymphocyte populations.", "iNKT cells express surface markers characteristic of both T and NK cells and respond to lipid antigen presentation by CD1d.", "Despite the low frequency of the iNKT population in the periphery (0.01 – 1% of CD3+ lymphocytes in humans), iNKT activity is now appreciated to play an important role in immunity to infectious diseases [72].", "During chronic HIV infection, the CD4+ iNKT subset is depleted [28,29], as observed in our present cohort.", "While some cohorts report full recovery of both CD4+ and CD4- iNKT subsets following ART [31], others report no effect of therapy", "[28,30] similar to the lack of CD4+ iNKT reconstitution seen during this study.", "Surprisingly, the increase in LAG-3 expression did not correspond to increased PD-1 expression, in contrast to another report by Moll et al.", "[30]. In both cohorts, iNKT PD-1 expression was several-fold higher than T cell PD-1 expression, but PD-1 was more readily detected on both cell subsets in our cohort.", "Differences in cohort ethnicity could contribute to the contrasting observations, but it is also plausible that the use of the EH12.2H7 anti-PD-1 clone coupled to the extremely bright Brilliant Violet 421 fluorochrome enabled more sensitive detection of PD-1 expression in this study than other clones and fluorochromes.", "To determine the impact of iNKT LAG-3 expression, we assessed functional iNKT cytokine production capacity in the Majengo cohort.", "Studies of iNKT function during HIV infection and treatment in the literature suffer from lack of replication in multiple cohorts, and the only functional study performed in an African cohort reported only PMA/Io-stimulated cytokine production from ART-naïve subjects [33].", "The decrease in αGalCer-induced IFNγ expression is similar to other cohorts, but the lack of functional reconstitution among ART experienced participants in this cohort is concerning [30,34].", "Data on iNKT recovery during ART is inconsistent, as some studies suggest an improvement of iNKT cytokine production following ART", "[32,73], while other studies have failed to find ART-based improvement of iNKT function [30], or have not differentiated between treated and untreated subjects [34].", "In this study, the ex vivo expression of LAG-3 on the iNKT subset inversely correlated with IFNγ secretion as measured by ICS following αGalCer stimulation.", "The consistent relationship between LAG-3 expression and IFNγ secretion for both CD4+ and CD4- iNKTs suggests a similar consequence of LAG-3 expression on both subsets, despite differences in IFNγ production between subsets in healthy individuals.", "The inhibitory activity of LAG-3 on iNKT IFNg expression was further confirmed by the demonstration that LAG-3+ iNKTs are highly unlikely to produce IFNγ following PMA/Io stimulation.", "The association of LAG-3, but not PD-1, with iNKT dysfunction during HIV infection is broadly consistent with a previous study of iNKT PD-1 expression [30].", "Although PD-1 expression was elevated among HIV-infected subjects in that cohort, its expression did not correlate with cytokine production or proliferation, and blocking of the PD-1/PD-L1 pathway did not improve proliferation or IFNγ secretion.", "To date, the contribution of other exhaustion markers (Tim-3, CD160, 2B4) to iNKT function during HIV infection has not been defined.", "The contribution of Tim-3 to iNKT inhibition during herpes simplex virus infection was assessed, but found to be not responsible for the defects in cytokine secretion [74].", "The only surface marker previously demonstrated to inversely correlate with iNKT cytokine production during HIV infection is the costimulatory molecule CD161 [34].", "CD161 is expressed by a variable, but generally high, proportion of iNKT cells [34,75,76]. The regulatory nature of CD161 on iNKT cells has not been fully clarified, as CD161+ iNKT cells are more likely to produce IFNγ and TNFα than CD161- cells in healthy individuals [76,77].", "Our study, however, did not assess CD161 expression and therefore cannot confirm or rule out a contribution of CD161 upregulation to iNKT dysfunction.", "To complement the ICS data, we also assessed cytokine/chemokine expression in cell culture supernatant after 5 days of αGalCer stimulation.", "In this assay, the background subtracted supernatant protein levels represent both iNKT cytokine expression and protein expression by other cell subsets in response to iNKT activation.", "As such, this data represents the downstream, cumulative impact of lipid stimulation/iNKT activation in a mixed culture.", "Give that iNKT activation is known to regulate a large number of other cell types, and that the functional impact of LAG-3 expression (which binds MHCII proteins) can only be truly assessed when MHCII-expressing cells are present, measuring cytokines in a whole PBMC culture may be more relevant than sorting and isolating iNKT cells.", "The correlation between iNKT frequency and analyte concentration strongly suggests that the measured analyte levels are iNKT-induced.", "Overall, several patterns emerged from analysis of cytokine/chemokine expression levels and correlations.", "Among HIV-N participants, IFNγ and IL-13 were the major cytokines produced in culture after IP-10. IFN-γ is a hallmark cytokine produced upon αGalCer stimulation, and IL-13 is produced by activated iNKT cells and directs monocyte to DC differentiation", "[78]. The loss of IL-13 secretion among HIV+ participants likely reflects, at least partially, the depletion of the CD4+ iNKT subset, which is reportedly the sole iNKT subset to produce IL-13 [64,79].", "In contrast, cytokine production among HIV+ ART naïve participants was mostly limited to IP-10 and MIP-1α/β production.", "The ART experienced group never produced significantly higher levels of any analyte compared the ART naïve group, and showed little evidence of iNKT reconstitution.", "These data suggest that in addition to a lack of reconstitution of iNKT function among ART experienced patients, the cytokine production profile is altered in comparison to both HIV-N and ART-naïve subjects.", "The correlations between sLAG-3 production and cytokine/chemokine concentrations among all study groups suggest that sLAG-3 may simply be a marker of iNKT activation.", "There is no evidence that increasing concentrations of sLAG-3 in culture results in inhibition of cytokine production.", "The lack of production of sLAG-3 in HIV+ ART naïve, but not ART-treated, participants is distinct compared to other cytokine/chemokine responses, which were generally absent in the ART treated group.", "The production of sLAG-3 by iNKT cells following stimulation has not been described in the literature, and represents a significant gap in knowledge.", "The correlation between LAG-3 expression and supernatant IFNγ at 5 days post-stimulation is consistent with the ICS results described above.", "It is important to note, however, that changes in LAG-3 expression during culture, and the contribution of other PBMC cell subsets to cytokine production make a direct link between LAG-3 expression and long-term cytokine production difficult.", "The positive correlations between PD-1 expression and cytokine production also suggest that PD-1 may indicate a more activated, rather than exhausted, iNKT phenotype.", "In conclusion, we have demonstrated both short-term and long-term defects in iNKT cytokine/chemokine expression in response to lipid stimulation in a Kenyan cohort of HIV+ ART naïve and experienced women.", "Although PD-1 expression did not appear to mediate iNKT dysfunction, the elevated expression of LAG-3 was associated with an inhibition of IFNγ production, suggesting that LAG-3 at least partially regulates iNKT function during chronic infection.", "Coupled with previous observations from our lab, and others, that LAG-3 is poorly expressed on T cells during HIV infection, blockade of LAG-3 signaling may selectively restore innate immune function and, therefore, improve current treatment regimens.", "Overall, our data suggest that LAG-3 is unlikely to play a significant role in T cell immune exhaustion in an African population.", "Unexpectedly, LAG-3 upregulation during chronic HIV infection and treatment may be restricted to the iNKT innate lymphocyte subset.", "The maintenance of LAG-3 expression during ART suggests that it may contribute to the innate immune dysregulation observed among ART subjects, as well as contributing to the loss of iNKT cytokine production observed during chronic infection.", "Future studies that demonstrate the cell-intrinsic activity of LAG-3 expression will determine whether blocking LAG-3 activity could improve innate immune responses initiated by iNKT cells during HIV infection or treatment.", "This study recruited 10 HIV-uninfected, 40 HIV-infected antiretroviral naïve and 40 HIV-infected antiretroviral experienced patients from the Majengo commercial sex worker cohort located in Nairobi, Kenya.", "In a follow-up study, an additional 16 HIV-N, 9 HIV+ and 17 HIV+ ART participants were recruited.

Participants responding “never” were exempted to complete the rest of the questionnaire.", "Participants were also asked whether having to think about what they have to cook is a constraint for them.", "The responses were rated on a 5-point Likert scale ranging from one (strongly disagree) to five (strongly agree).", "Participants were then asked whether they planned meals, even in an irregular manner (yes I do, yes I did but not anymore, no I never planned meals).", "The definition of “planning meals” given to the participants was “to plan ahead the foods that will be eaten for the next few days”.", "Participants who reported planning meal currently were considered as “meal planners” whereas others were categorized as “non-meal planners”.", "Finally, the questionnaire included questions about meal planning frequency (several times a week, once a week, once every two weeks, two to three times a month, not regularly), duration (a few days, one week, two weeks or more), period of the week (weekdays, weekend, weekdays and weekend) and sources of inspiration (personal recipe repertoire, Internet or apps, ingredients available during grocery shopping).", "At baseline and annually thereafter, participants in the NutriNet-Santé study are asked to provide socio-demographic data, including sex, age (18–30, 30–50, 50–65, >65 years), educational level (up to secondary, some college or university degree), monthly income (<1,200 €, 1,200–1,800 €, 1,800–2,700 € and >2,700 € per consumption unit), presence of children in the household (yes, no), history of dieting to lose weight during the past year (yes, no) and physical activity (low, moderate, high).", "Monthly household income is calculated per “consumption unit” (CU), where one CU is attributed for the first adult in the household, 0.5 CU for other persons aged 14 or older, and 0.3 CU for children under 14, following national statistics methodology and guidelines [39].", "Physical activity was assessed using a short form of the French version of the International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ).", "The weekly energy expenditure expressed in metabolic equivalent task minutes per week was estimated, and three scores of physical activity were constituted [i.e., low (<30 min/day), moderate (30–59 min/day), and high (≥60 min/day)]", "according to the French guidelines for physical activity [40].", "For the present study, we used the closest available data with respect to the assessment of meal planning practices.", "At inclusion and once a year thereafter, participants are invited to complete three non-consecutive 24-h dietary records, randomly assigned over a 2-week period (two weekdays and one weekend day).", "For the present analysis, we selected participants who completed at least three 24-h dietary records since their inclusion in the cohort study (i.e. completed between May 2009 and December 2014).", "Participants reported all foods and beverages consumed at each eating occasion. They estimated the amounts eaten using validated photographs of portion sizes [41], using household measures or by indicating the exact quantity (grams) or volume (milliliters).", "Daily mean food intakes were calculated, weighted for the type of day of the week. Energy, nutrient and food group intakes were estimated using the NutriNet-Santé composition table including more than 2000 foods [42].", "Dietary underreporting was identified on the basis of the method proposed by Black [43]. We hypothesize that meal planning encourages food preparation and therefore considered food groups that can be used in food preparation (e.g. eggs).", "In addition, we considered food groups that have nutritional interest (e.g. fruits). Thus, the following food groups were included in the study: fruits, vegetables, fish (including seafood and processed seafood), meat (including cooked ham, offal), eggs, milk, cheese, added fats (including oil, butter, margarine, vinaigrette), sugary products (e.g. cake, biscuits, sugars, honey, jam, chocolate) and starchy foods (including potato, legumes, pasta, rice, other cereals) with a specific focus on legumes and whole grain starchy foods (including whole grain pasta, rice, other cereals).", "Adherence to nutritional guidelines was assessed using the PNNS Guideline Score (PNNS-GS). The 15-point PNNS-GS is a validated a priori score reflecting the adherence to the official French nutritional guidelines which has been extensively described elsewhere [44].", "Details on computation of this score are in Additional file 1. Briefly, it includes 13 components: eight refer to food-serving recommendations (fruit and vegetables; starchy foods; whole grain products; dairy products; meat, eggs and fish; fish and seafood; vegetable fat; water vs. soda), four refer to moderation in consumption (added fat; salt; sweets; alcohol) and one component pertains to physical activity [44, 45].", "Points are deducted for overconsumption of salt (>12 g/day), added sugars (>17.5% of energy intake), or when energy intake exceeds the needed energy level by more than 5%.", "Each component cut-off was that of the threshold defined by the PNNS public health objectives when available [45] otherwise they were established according to the French Recommended Dietary Allowances [46].", "For the present analysis, we consider the mPNNS-GS, a modified version of the PNNS-GS, which takes into account only the dietary components, therefore excluding the physical activity component.", "Food variety has been defined as the number of different food items reported to be eaten over a given reference period [47].", "Considering that seasonality is likely to influence food variety and that a period of 10 to 15 days has been recommended to accurately assess food variety [48], the food variety was evaluated using a Food Frequency Questionnaire (FFQ).", "Sixteen months after baseline, participants were invited to complete a self-administrated 240-items FFQ to assess their usual dietary intake over the past year [49].", "Participants were asked to report their consumption frequency on the basis of how many times they ate the standard portion size proposed (typical household measurements such as spoon or standard unit such as a yogurt).", "The frequency of consumption referred to usual consumption over the past year on an increasing scale including yearly, monthly, weekly or daily units, as suitable, and participants were asked to provide only one answer.", "The food variety score corresponded to the number of FFQ items reported to be consumed at least once during the last year [47].", "The maximum score was therefore 240. Fruit and vegetable variety scores were also computed based on the number of different fruits and vegetables reported by the participants.", "Height and weight were assessed by using an anthropometric questionnaire, which was self-administered online, at baseline and each year thereafter [50, 51].", "For each participant, the closest available data to the meal planning questionnaire were used for the analysis.", "Data were not collected for pregnant women. BMI (in kg/m2) was calculated as the ratio of weight to squared height.", "Participants were classified as underweight or normal weight (BMI < 25), overweight (25 ≤ BMI < 30) and obesity (BMI ≥ 30) according to WHO references values [52].", "The analysis focused on participants who had completed the meal planning questionnaire, had declared being involved in meal preparation in their household, and who had completed at least three 24-h dietary records since they were included in the study, as well as the FFQ.", "Chi-square tests and Student’s t tests were used to compare characteristics of included vs. excluded participants, as well as meal planners vs. non-meal planners.", "Meal planners’ practices were also described. Continuous variables are presented as means ± SDs and categorical variables as percentages.", "ANCOVAs were performed to investigate the relationship between meal planning and energy, macronutrients and food groups.", "However, for some particular food groups which did not exhibit normal distribution (i.e. eggs, milk, legumes, and whole grain starchy foods), mainly due to a high proportion of non-consumers, a binary variable (consumer/non-consumer) was created and a logistic regression analysis was performed.", "Logistic regression models were also used to assess the associations between meal planning and quartiles of mPNNS-GS, as well as quartiles of food variety scores (overall, fruit and vegetable) and BMI categories.", "Due to significant interactions and differences on the associations with meal planning, analyses on BMI were performed separately by sex.", "Meal planning has been described as a cooking skill [53]. Thus, characteristics that have been shown to influence cooking practices, dietary intakes or weight status were considered as confounders in the present analyses.", "Models were therefore all adjusted for sex [1, 54, 55], age [56], educational level, monthly income [6], presence of children in the household [6], history of dieting to lose weight during the past year [57], physical activity [58], and cooking frequency.", "Models evaluating the associations with mPNNS-GS, macronutrient and food groups intakes were further adjusted for daily energy intake and number of 24-h dietary records completed by participants.", "The energy model was only adjusted on the number of 24-h records while the food variety models were adjusted on daily energy intake.", "Missing covariate data were imputed using multiple imputation method.", "Sensitivity analyses were conducted on a subsample of individuals having responded to at least one of the dietary assessments (i.e. FFQ, dietary records).", "In addition, analyses were conducted using another definition of food variety score (number of FFQ items reported to be consumed more than once a week)", "All tests of statistical significance were two-sided and the type I error was set at 5%.

First, meal planning might address the issue of not knowing what to prepare for dinner, that has been previously described as a barrier for home meal preparation [29].", "Second, by planning meals individuals may think about recipes that can be prepared in a limited period of time and, therefore reduce the feeling of time scarcity, that may limit home meal preparation", "[6, 12, 16] and increase the recourse to food choice coping strategies such as eating out, delivery meals or ready prepared food", "[17, 23–25]. In addition, planning meals may reduce the risk of missing ingredients for home meal preparation which could also lead to the consumption of food prepared away from home.", "Finally, deciding what foods will be eaten in the next few days could also enable individuals to cook more diversified recipes and to anticipate grocery shopping for the specific ingredients needed, thus potentially explaining the increased food variety observed in meal planners.", "However, reverse causality cannot be excluded since individuals interested in having a healthy diet might be more likely to plan their meals.", "In line with this idea, meal-planners in our sample were more likely to have higher educational level, to have higher income, to be physically active and to have a lower BMI, characteristics that have been related with a better attitude towards healthy eating [61].", "Our results showed that women who planned meals were less likely to be overweight or obese, while in men, there was an association with obesity only.", "Since meal planners have a diet of higher quality, it potentially prevents overweight in these individuals [52].", "However, we cannot exclude reverse causality.

Young, old, LGBTQ+, straight and everyone in between showed up this time.", "Compared to a more Baby Boomer-centric 2017 crowd, it felt like the success of the Queen biopic Bohemian Rhapsody reignited their mass appeal.", "After all the decades of stratospheric highs and sad times, it was a beautiful full circle moment to witness."]}

Here’s our explainer, first published December 5.", "Greater ambition is in Xcel’s political and economic interests", "Xcel has been a leader on clean energy for a while. According to the company, it has reduced its carbon emissions by 35 percent since 2005.", "Earlier in 2018, it announced plans to, by 2030, reduce carbon emissions 60 percent (from 2005 levels), increase the level of renewable energy in its fleet to 55 percent, and shut down 50 percent of its coal capacity — in the state of Colorado.", "Those goals were enough to win the company Utility Dive’s Utility of the Year Award for 2018.", "But the new goals go much farther. And they cover Xcel’s entire eight-state territory.", "So what pushed the company’s ambition so much higher?", "First, renewables are getting really cheap. In its recent solicitations, Xcel has gotten more bids for renewables, with more variety, for much cheaper.", "Wind and solar plants paired with storage are bidding in cheaper than the ongoing operating costs of existing coal plants.", "Renewables are even giving natural gas a run for its money.", "Second, Xcel’s customers — particularly cities — are demanding it. “When your customers are asking for this over and over,” Fowke said when announcing the news, “you really do listen.", "Boulder, the city of Denver, Breckenridge ... Pueblo, they’re considered or they have already decided that they want to pursue 100 percent renewable.”", "Remember that, because it’s important in an age of no federal climate policy: Cities can move utilities, and utilities can move the energy industry.", "Third, the political landscape is shifting. Democrats took the governor’s mansion in Colorado, Michigan, New Mexico, and Wisconsin.", "In Colorado and New Mexico, they now have a “trifecta” — governor and both legislative houses. Running for governor in Colorado, Jared Polis supported a new renewable energy standard of 100 percent by 2040; with Democratic majorities in the state legislature, he might get it passed.", "Renewables are on the rise in the West, popular with politicians, cities, corporations, and ordinary ratepayers.", "It is to Xcel’s benefit to get ahead of the curve and give the people what they want.", "Fourth, Xcel would very much like to build more stuff.", "It is a vertically integrated monopoly. The areas in which it operates have not been “restructured,” i.e., generation has not been split off from transmission and distribution.", "Regulated monopoly utilities, as I’ve explained in previous stories, do not make money on the power they sell or the fuel they buy.", "They make money by drawing a rate of return on investments in power infrastructure. These “rate-based” investments are the utility’s bread and butter.", "In a broad sense, the shift to renewables is good for such utilities. When they shift from existing fossil fuel plants to new renewable energy, they shift from fuel (coal and natural gas) costs, which they make no money on, to investments in new renewable energy power plants, new batteries to store power and electric car chargers to help electrify the vehicle fleet, and tons of new transmission lines, much of which they can rate-base.", "These goals (perhaps combined with a new, more stringent RPS in Colorado) will help Xcel get permission from regulators to depreciate lots of uneconomic old fossil-fuel assets (which activists have been hassling it about anyway) and build, build, build a bunch of new stuff.", "In short, Xcel stands to profit handsomely, and benefit politically, by giving its customers the clean energy they want.", "(Many ratepayer advocates worry that utilities like Duke are taking advantage of this dynamic, using clean energy as an excuse to build stuff that local, distributed energy could handle better — but that’s a different post.)", "A more interesting question is how this might affect Xcel’s monopoly status. On one hand, riding a political wave as a climate champion allows it to stay ahead of grumbling or desire for restructuring.", "On the other hand, Xcel suddenly needing so much clean energy might help grease the skids for regionalization, i.e., the creation of a restructured Western wholesale power market run by a regional transmission operator (RTO).", "If all of the West is heading toward decarbonization together, the region’s utilities will need to pool their resources.", "In fact, they might need to pool their resources rapidly, because the federal tax credits for wind and solar power are set to expire soon.", "Buying a lot of capacity before then could save a lot of money.", "Fifth — and this may be somewhat peripheral, but it’s interesting — on the very same day Xcel made its announcement, the Boulder City Council voted to move forward with creating a municipal utility and breaking off from Xcel.", "Xcel very much opposes that move.
