Whether you’re entering a new market, investigating nascent growth opportunities, or crafting a strategic recommendation, the first step to transforming that blank slate into a successful outcome is undoubtedly understanding the market landscape.", "But with the sheer amount of information available, conducting market landscape analysis isn’t always straightforward—even the term itself is vague at best.", "To fuel smart decisions, mapping the landscape typically involves three key steps: 1. Identifying the key players within a given sector (along with their revenue streams and product offerings), 2.", "Understanding the economic potential and growth levers within this space, and 3. Analyzing how this impacts your own company and its strategic decision-making.", "Distilling what matters most in order to drive confident decisions requires access to diverse market perspectives and the right tools to prioritize, ingest, and analyze the most relevant insights across this content.", "Below, we will explore how the AlphaSense platform enables you to surface the intelligence and insights you need to master market landscape analysis in three easy steps.", "To start a landscape analysis, it’s important to focus on the market’s key components: think total addressable market (TAM), key organizational players, outlook, and customer base.", "Not only because these are often the top-line metrics that will resonate with decision-makers, but also because understanding the current state of the market helps us set a good foundation for spending our time wisely moving forward in our research.", "Some of the most valuable content for quickly ascertaining the TAM of a sector or product is broker research.", "Broker research, produced by the world’s leading banks to keep their clients abreast of industry outlooks and to drive investment decisions, is also invaluable for market sizing.", "In this example, we’re looking to size the market for continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) — identifying and verifying the size and growth potential of the CGM market in less than a minute using Boolean search.", "Those familiar with the AlphaSense platform will recognize the yellow underlines as an indicator of Smart Synonyms™—results with synonymous terms that wouldn’t ordinarily be picked up by CTRL+F-ing your way through a document.", "Including the “$” symbol is also an essential characteristic of this search, allowing us to quickly narrow down results that are specific to dollar amounts as they relate to TAM.", "“The U.S. TAM for CGMs is large at +145MM patients, which we estimate was just ~2.5% penetrated in 2023 with TAM penetration of all Type 1+Type 2 at ~11%…By our estimate, the global CGM market stood at $10.0B in 2023 (up 23.5% y/y) that is poised to grow at a mid-teens CAGR to $27.3B in 2030E.”", "Now it’s time to better understand how this TAM breaks down across various players. Broker research can also assist us in understanding both market share and player positioning.", "As a visual learner, I prefer to start off with a graphical representation of what this market share looks like.", "In AlphaSense, we can quickly find the best visuals around CGM market share using the Charts & Tables search.", "This gives us a great jumping off point for understanding the key players with significant market share: Medtronic, Dexcom, and Abbott.", "For a more complete picture of all players in the global CGM space, we can simply search for “CGM” and scroll down to “Companies in Search Results,” where major players are listed with their respective market cap and revenue.", "Tip: Once we’ve identified the biggest players within our target market, we can add these companies to a watchlist to easily search for any topic across this list, or create a dashboard to stay up-to-date on recent events and news.", "An interesting observation here is that while Medtronic has a market cap of $113B (more than double Dexcom’s), less than 20% of its market share is for CGM (as seen in the chart found above).", "We can easily interrogate the why behind this percentage by exploring products and revenue streams in the Financials & Estimates tab of Medtronic’s Company page.", "Upon further investigation, we can see that the Diabetes business segment only accounts for 7% of Medtronic’s total revenue.", "We’ll cover this workflow more in depth in the next section.", "In some cases, the target customer profile for this market may be obvious (i.e. even before starting research on CGM, we likely know that these products are intended to serve people with diabetes).", "But whether we’re looking to verify our existing hypotheses, or dive deeper into various audience segments, leveraging AlphaSense’s expansive search capabilities can help us efficiently create a robust customer profile.", "For example, by using a general thematic search for CGM and browsing our image search results, we can quickly gather key information about potential and current customers for CGMs—including the nuances among CGM, injection, and pump users, and how GLP-1s can impact CGM usage.", "These nuances within an audience group will further help us in Step 3, where we’ll identify areas of opportunity for us to capitalize on.", "Now that we’ve started to piece together the big-picture of the market, we can take our research a step further and dig deeper into each of the major players we identified in Step 1.", "In this step, we’ll look to paint a detailed picture of each company, including their revenue streams, product offerings, and executive priorities.", "With Company Tearsheets, we can quickly get up-to-speed on the must-knows about each of the players we’ve identified.", "The Financials & Estimates tab gives us insight into product and geographic segments, along with key earnings performance metrics like EBITDA.", "By looking at Abbott’s company page, for example, we can see that medical devices (including CGM) brought in just under $17B in 2023, representing about 40% of total revenue—and that this revenue is globally distributed.", "We can also compare key growth metrics over a 5Y or 10Y historical period:", "Finally, we can dive deeper into this financial performance using Smart Summaries for Companies. These generative-AI powered summaries feature the key highlights and lowlights from a company’s earnings call, allowing us to glean additional context into the “why” behind the financial data.", "Within Company Summaries, I can also explore when and why certain brokers have upgraded or downgraded their ratings of Abbott—which can indicate market sentiment for a company’s financial performance and outlook for upcoming quarters.", "Tip: Click into any of our AI-generated Smart Summaries to access the exact snippet of text from which it was sourced.", "While financial metrics can tell part of the story about a company’s current position and performance, it’s just as important to understand their shifting priorities and products to address market conditions.", "Within the Company Tearsheet on the AlphaSense platform, just beneath the Smart Summaries modules, is Company Topics.", "This section can help us quickly analyze a company’s top priorities based on executive chatter in earnings calls.", "Clicking into any of these topics allows us to access Snippet Explorer, which maps all mentions of this topic over historical earnings calls, investor presentations, and more company events.", "This enables us to quickly understand how company sentiment or narrative has shifted around a given topic.", "In this example, we’re exploring historical mentions of Libre, which is Abbott’s flagship CGM device.", "Finally, if I want to dive even deeper into specific product offerings discovered in this process, I can use the dual company and keyword search bars to search specifically for mentions of “Libre” across documents tagged to Abbott.", "From the Search Summaries module, powered by our Smart Summaries generative AI technology, I can immediately learn about Libre’s role in Abbott’s overall strategy.", "In this final step, we build off of our foundational research to find specific gaps, challenges, and/or opportunities to cannibalize or grow market share.", "Much of this involves gaining a deeper understanding of the competitive landscape—each player’s relative strengths and weaknesses, as well as customer and investor sentiment.", "Formalizing a SWOT analysis for key players in a market can bring clarity and identify opportunities for market penetration.", "We can use much of the information gathered in the second step as a jumping off point for analysis. For example, if understanding that Libre is critical to Abbott’s offering in the CGM space as step one, then a few examples of what we can do next include:", "- Are there specific customer profiles where Libre is performing better than other CGM device offerings from other companies?", "- Does the operating income that the Diabetes segment is working with give ample room for the growth projected?", "- Are there weak points in the supply chain that present enhanced risk for Abbott relative to its competitors?", "In AlphaSense, a great jumping off point for this SWOT analysis is heading back over to our Smart Summaries modules on the Company page.", "We can toggle to Research and Expert Call summaries, which have dedicated sections for Opportunities & Strengths and Threats & Weaknesses.", "Research summaries help us understand investor sentiment, with a particular tilt towards predicting future stock performance.", "Expert Call summaries offer an inside track into customer and former employee perspectives, giving us boots-on-the-ground perspectives.", "While all of this secondary research is essential for us to map the landscape, we can’t forget about primary research.", "When it comes to market landscape analysis, primary data can range from surveys and market research, to expert interviews and customer feedback.", "Expert Transcript Libraries are a great tool to tap into deep expertise from former executives, partners, suppliers, and customers for a specific company or product.", "This offers us multiple first-hand perspectives that we’d never get from secondary research alone. In this case, we’re able to explore an interview with a customer that uses a Free Libre device from Abbott, and is able to directly compare it to Dexcom’s devices from personal experience.", "Additionally, one of our newest content offerings is AlphaSense’s Voice of Customer interviews.

A rapidly emerging, and often essential, part of health care involves the growth of information and communications technologies (ICTs)", "[1,2]. Electronic health, or eHealth, encompasses a remarkably wide range of interpretations related to health care [3,4] and ICTs", "[5,6], with one study documenting over 50 uniquely different definitions for the term “eHealth,” such as the application of e-commerce to health care and pharmaceuticals, the use of new media technologies for social policy, and the integration of the Internet into health care [7].", "Such diverse interpretations can lead to multiple operational definitions of eHealth, negatively influencing generalizability of study results", "[8]. This is complicated by alternative terms appearing in the literature and in practice, with those terms also evolving as the technology changes.", "For example, the United States federal government and other agencies use the terms “telemedicine” and “telehealth” to generally refer to applications of ICTs in the practice of medicine, but are attempting to reach consensus on the use of the terms [9].", "In one bibliographic analysis, the term “telemedicine” was used more than “eHealth” in English-speaking countries, whereas “eHealth” was more popular in non–English-speaking countries; “eHealth” is trending at a higher rate overall [10,11].", "Therefore, any analysis or review of telemedicine, telehealth, or eHealth programs must be cautious when comparing outcomes, as there are interpretations supported by the definitions, the types and implementations of the technology, and how it was used in the particular health intervention context.", "These should not be treated as exogenous factors. Within this terminology health care, individual, clinical, and public health are often confounded, thus covering a wide range of health application contexts including financial and business sectors [12].", "Regardless of the broader terms (eHealth, telemedicine, telehealth), one term has emerged and tends to refer to a specific class of technologies and the associated ways in which the class is used with respect to health—mobile smart phone telephony or mHealth.", "In this paper, we briefly examine the etymology of the term “mHealth,” followed by an examination of technologies used in mHealth.", "Then, we describe core characteristics of mHealth’s current technologies in terms of their potential relevance for the general “health of the public” which has implications for health care at large, to the localities of health practice, and to individualization of information, clinical care, and behavioral intervention.", "We present this paper as augmenting other discussions regarding strategies taking mHealth forward [13,14].", "As mHealth evolves in methods for engaging in prevention, care, treatment, and monitoring of health, these characteristics will help guide development toward more effective and efficient health solutions.", "As ICTs evolve in their forms, capacity, and presence, these characteristics will help health professionals instantiate components of their health solutions to realize their health goals.", "In short, this paper addresses the following question: What are the core characteristics of mHealth and why are they important?", "mHealth typically includes applications in both public health and clinical medicine, so the distinction can be blurred.", "In clinical medicine, mHealth includes health costs, health delivery, Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) or health information technology, and health telematics [15,16].", "Although no standard definition of mHealth exits, both the World Health Organization and National Institutes of Health have offered reasonable and overlapping definitions of mHealth consistent with the view in this paper.", "Table 1 includes additional agency definitions. mHealth generally involves the use of mobile phones which, depending on the particular phone, directly support audio, video, photography, geolocation, sensors (proximity infrared, touch, accelerometer, ambient light illuminance, humidity, three-axis gyroscope, temperature, magnetometer, geomagnetic, ultraviolet exposure, light spectral, gestural-infrared, barometer, pedometer, pulsometer, heart rate, radiation detection), Internet or Web access, and various forms of texting, with locally running mostly third-party applications, or “apps,” as the emerging terminology standard [17].", "| Word Health Organization | mHealth involves the use of and capitalization on a mobile phone’s core utility of voice and short messaging service (SMS) as well as more complex functionalities and apps including general packet radio service (GPRS), third and fourth generation mobile telecommunications (3G and 4G systems), global positioning system (GPS), and Bluetooth technology [28].", "| US National Insitutes of Health | At NIH, we think about this really as diverse application of wireless and mobile technologies designed to improve health research, health care services, and health outcomes, and I think this is really important because it is not just mobile phones.", "You can think of it as sensors, any kind of sensors you can think of [29]. |", "| US Federal Communications Commission | The use of mobile networks and devices in supporting e-care.", "Emphasizes leveraging health-focused applications on general-purpose tools such as mobile phones and SMS to drive active health participation by consumers and clinicians [30].", "| US Department of Health and Human Services | The use of wireless technologies, such as mobile phones, personal digital assistants, and netbooks, for improving health", "| mHealth Working Group | mHealth is the use of mobile technologies in public health and health service settings [32].", "| European Coordination Committee of the Radiological, Electromedical and Healthcare IT Industry (COCIR) | COCIR regards mHealth as a subset of eHealth and defines it as the provision of eHealth services and information that relies on mobile and wireless technologies", "| Adopted by mHealth Regulatory Coalition | Programs (apps) that deliver health-related services using mobile phones and tablets.", "Some apps offer advice and tracking functionality for healthy living.

Mobile phones are now serving as a natural platform for applying such data acquisition approaches for conditions as tobacco use [141], alcohol use [142], development of virtues [143], mood and affect assessment", "[144], diet and physical activity [145], and obesity-specific contexts [146], with additional activity sensor capabilities that serve to augment “message-based” data for such approaches [147].", "Individual tethering accordingly supports personalized medicine or public health interventions as allowing for specific messages to be sent to specific individuals.", "In general, individually-tailored messages in public health interventions are more likely (when properly designed) to effect behavior change than generic messages [148].", "Although the particular definition of “tailoring” in public health and health care has varied widely [149,150], our interpretation simply addresses the fundamental characteristic of what the technology can deliver—connectivity tethered to an individual.", "How any form of tailoring will be used (and its likely impact will be) exploiting that characteristic depends on the quality of the design in the context of an intervention.", "For example, linking an ecological momentary assessment method with an intervention treatment to support individually-tailored SMS connectivity [151], but use of other forms of tailoring exploiting the tethered nature of mobile phones are being developed, such as with human immunodeficiency virus adherence [152], but is a growing component of many SMS intervention designs [153].", "Again, the tethered technology affords various types of tailoring, but the impact of any tailoring depends on the quality of the design and its implementation.", "Of course, the 1:1 mapping also allows for large amounts of (and of potentially high fidelity) patient-generated health data, aggregated for location and time-dependent analyses at a group level, such as disease surveillance or clinical practice statistics [154,155].", "A question regarding tethering involves not only the generation of individual’s data but also one of access to individual’s EHR.", "A survey by Accenture [156] demonstrates how both physicians’ and health consumers’ attitudes and behaviors regarding digital technology and health have changed in 2 years, for example, in patient’s actual access their electronic records (2014: 27%, 2016: 45%), in what data they have access to in their EHR (2014: 39%, 2016: 65%), and in the use of health apps (2014: 16%, 2016: 33%).", "However, the same survey revealed that 92% of patients believed that they should have full access to their EHR, whereas only 18% of physicians held that same belief.", "This is one example of gaps that may exist between 2 of the key stakeholders with respect to use of this technology: patients and their health care providers.", "Characteristic Interactions and Their Consequences", "Of course, the world is often more complex and dynamic than we either describe or anticipate. Collectively, interactions and secondary impacts of these characteristics are beginning to emerge.", "For example, the problem of individuals’ “access to access” (ie, availability of technology that enables access to health services) is evaporating.", "As the penetration of smartphone into all populations continues, it affords an important vehicle for recruitment of under-represented groups in clinical trials and other health-related research [157].", "But as technology forms become more effective and efficient, so do mHealth offerings, and this usually results in differential access (eg, via cost) to the “best” mHealth solutions [158].", "Mobile phone–based apps allow the localization of data acquisition, processing, and presentation or response options to specific individuals, situations, and context.", "Access to the Internet or World Wide Web increases the amount and forms of data gathered and transmitted to and from individuals and groups, over time and across place.", "Consequently, mHealth for health care has generated many variations of technological use, ranging from the ability to generate tailored messages to individuals or to groups of individuals with similar needs via the Web [159] or via text messages [160], to engaging technological combinations such as those being designed in broad, social media systems [161] affording “peer-to-peer” health care [162] or to realizing new health surveillance capabilities through extant technology and relevant populations, such as “participatory epidemiology” forms of engagement and rapid communication [163-165].", "The rise of inter-connectivity of local health-rated devices will not only increase the potential of mHealth but also increase the complexity of its design.", "The nature of “wearable” health devices are currently worn either on the wrist (55%) or the chest (27%) or the purse or pocket or shoe (17%), but are also appearing on the arm (8%), head (7%) clothing (6%) leg or ear (5%), ankle (3%), necklace (3%), or finger (1%)", "[109] and are highly dependent on sensors [166]. The global wearable health device market between 2015-2020 is projected to achieve revenue growth of $41.3 billion by 2020", "[167]. Pennic [168] cites a MarketsandMarkets report projecting the ingestible sensor market to grow to $678 million by 2020.", "Data captured by these devices can form a personal, integrated health sensor network that could be easily collected, integrated, and analyzed by mobile phone technology.", "The rapid development of mHealth technologies has resulted in market interposition wherein traditional providers of health care services have been partially displaced by preferred technological self-treatment [169].", "In fact, Price-Waterhouse-Coopers placed “Do-it-yourself healthcare” as their top health industry issue for 2015 [170] and places “care in the palm of your hand” as the third top industry issue for 2016 [171].", "However, this may speak less about preference of care and more about ease of access. Given the opportunities for engaging mHealth apps for public health, it is necessary to understand the broad array of interconnection forces at play, now and likely in the future.", "This is a distinctly different patient-facing functionality than the failed Google Health’s medical records or health data platform [172] offering various forms of disintermediating from “traditional” health care reimbursement, face-to-face models, but it is difficult to predict how the insurance industry or federal or state regulators will respond.", "What is clear is that the upcoming Stage 3 requirement of the Meaningful Use incentive program from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services strongly encourages patient engagement (care management, wellness, and patient supplied data) outside of a clinic using mobile health apps, coordination of care, and patient access to health information via mobile platforms [173].", "Recall that Apple’s HealthKit integrates with the Epic System’s EHR system. Consider that one of the primary reasons for HealthKit’s growing adoption in health systems is the fundamental simplicity of connecting to institutional EHR systems [174], and the top EHR vendor meeting the Meaningful Use requirement is Epic [175].", "Note also that Duke Medicine recently succeeded in being the first Epic-based health system to implement the Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources standard with Apple’s HealthKit", "[176], a standard that also allows Epic Systems EHR data to interoperate with IBM’s Watson Health analytics [177].", "Overall, the adoption of even basic EHR by the key gatekeepers, the physicians, is occluded by the encountered difficulties of data exchange, whether it involves interoperability standards or strategic moves by vendors to gain competitive advantage [178].", "Nevertheless, specific inroads work to demonstrate ways of overcoming such obstacles for specific health objectives on mobile apps [179-181].", "mHealth is an ill-defined, but growing component of all aspects of health (prevention, diagnosis, treatment, research) around the world.", "We focused on 4 core characteristics of the foundational platform, the mobile smartphone, that will likely remain as important to understand to help design and implement more effective and efficient mHealth solutions.", "More importantly, as each characteristic has surprising depth, complexity, and relation to the other characteristics, it is essential to discern how these work together in any particular mHealth context.", "Each type of characteristic embodies both features and constraints.", "This is the fastest spreading communication technology. The first core characteristic—penetration into populations—is possible because mobile telephony is becoming ubiquitous, and this has significant implications for reach into populations, although not homogenously in many cases.", "Therefore, is necessary to know the technological platform most adopted and how it is used by the target population or subgroup.", "Apps are powerful but issues of use are complicated. The second core characteristic—the availability of app — affords potentially sophisticated function (and computation) available to the device, depending on the type of mobile phone.", "In addition, the growth of short-range device connectivity allows ancillary devices to be connected to the mobile phone, enlarging the set of technological options in communication, monitoring, and delivery of health solutions.", "In addition, both the sophistication of sensors on, or connected to, a mobile phone raises the question of whether it is (they are) a medical device (in a legal sense) and how HIPAA rules guide the storage and use of that data.", "Given the immense growth in apps, competition can be intense, but opportunities for innovation are practically unbounded.", "Connectivity matters. The third characteristic—wireless broadband—is the most rapidly growing technological platform for Internet access, so consideration of mHealth contexts with Internet connectivity, even intermittent connectivity, affords a substantially different pathway for expected data rates to and from devices, influencing the formation and functionality of mHealth apps and their target groups.", "However, as lower income groups increase their (often sole) reliance on mobile broadband for Internet connectivity, data charges can escalate rapidly.", "Costs to the client are still a part of the use equation.", "Almost everybody has a mobile phone. The fourth characteristic—that mobile phones are generally tethered to individuals—affords direct access to individuals allowing deep penetration to the individual level, with apps being tailored to individuals and having the ability to adapt to individual behaviors and physiological data, captured and communicated distally (if necessary) in real time.", "The primary interpretation of the 4 characteristics is that they serve as both opportunities and constraints.", "However, to exploit them as either, it is essential to understand what they are, and how they relate to one’s specific mHealth context.", "Regardless, they are the enduring characteristics common to all mHealth mobile phone apps.", "Recently Gordon Moore (the architect of Moore’s Law) stated, We’ve just seen the beginning of what computers are going to do for us [182].", "The ubiquity of the devices, their computational ability, and their ability to capture and rapidly transmit complex data, whether the data comes from “medical devices (Food and Drug Administration approved) or not, the rate and amount of data captured lends itself to large-scale analytics affording new, broader capabilities” [183] which, of course, can be used for “good or evil” [184].", "Along with “Big Data” often comes “Big Noise,” so the merging of technology and health contexts will allow us the opportunity to move from collecting data, which has a cost (eg, acquisition, storage, transfer, security, integrity), to efficiently extracting information, which as a value by guiding decisions that lead to health improvements in individuals, groups, and societies.", "The key is achieving the economically-viable potential to turn acquired data into information that can be applied to the betterment of health, which necessitates not only well-designed interventions but also well-designed evaluations of those interventions [185].", "Yet, there is likely another level where health care, and public health, use that information to inform policies that are enabled, and not blocked, by institutional mechanisms.", "Still the fundamental mantra remains: mHealth is not about technology; it is about how technology is appropriately used in the context of achieving specific health goals [186,187].", "Nevertheless, future discussions must include additional considerations of how to weave the use and usability of such technology into the foundational designs of interventions, and not simply a delivery platform afterthought, as technology is not neutral.", "Translating evidence-based interventions for one mode in which it was designed (eg, workshops) cannot be adopted for another mode without determining the impact on the integrity of the original logic [188,189].", "Mobile phone and communication technologies afford us characteristics with remarkable capabilities and potential.", "And these are rapidly, unpredictably, and even disruptively, changing and changing health care and public health.", "This work was funded in part by a grant from Emory University’s Global Health Institute and the Goizueta Business School Summer Research Fund at Emory University.", "Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act", "- 1.WHO.

Studies have shown a correlation between increased TIR and a reduction in diabetes complications [36–38].", "As such, TIR is recommended as a new key metric of glycaemic control [25].

previous years, 22 we argue that an SIP requires a set of core components: digital dose capture, real-time wireless connectivity, real-time connectivity with glucose-sensing devices, and integration with insulin-dosing decision support.", "The Companion InPen, released in December 2017, is the first FDA-approved “smart pen” for insulin to meet these criteria.", "In reviewing key functionalities of the InPen, we highlight general principles of user design and interoperability that will be key for future SIPs.", "At its core, the InPen is an insulin delivery device, augmented with Bluetooth connection to a paired smartphone application, which provides bolus calculator functionality and automatic data capture.", "The current model of InPen depends on predetermined therapy settings programmed into the smartphone app, but as Kerr and Warshaw describe in their roadmap to smart insulin pens (see Figure 1), future SIPs should enable advanced decision support, to aid individualized insulin therapy.", "In practice, the InPen allows the programming of personalized insulin delivery settings—target glucose, insulin to carbohydrate ratio (ICR), insulin sensitivity factor (ISF), duration of insulin action (DIA)—into a user’s smartphone application.", "Based on these settings, calculations guide users to manually deliver personalized doses of rapid acting insulin for mealtime and corrections.", "Importantly, because the InPen captures dose history, the calculations automatically subtract “insulin on board.”", "Thus, users benefit from individualized digital tools similar to those found in an insulin pump, but with a lower cost and with the freedom of not being continuously connected to a pump.", "Smart Insulin Pens: The Future of Digitized Insulin Delivery", "Insulin pens are likely to remain the predominant insulin delivery device for the foreseeable future, in part due to familiarity and preferences by patients and primary care providers, and in part due to limited access or interest in insulin pumps.", "By bringing digital technology and connectivity to insulin pens, we believe that SIPs have the potential to dramatically improve quality of care and the care experience for millions of people living with diabetes.", "While some benefits of these devices accrue directly between device and user, many other potential benefits require that we both develop and leverage a more connected data ecosystem and clinical delivery system using device data in care delivery.", "24 Historical experience with CGM and insulin pumps shows that, when clinical infrastructure and device connectivity are inadequate, patients and providers underutilize retrospective data review.", "25 Because the vast majority of PWD receive diabetes care in the primary care setting, achieving spread and use of SIPs at scale will require much more seamless data flows and easy-to-use toolkits within the typical clinical practice setting.", "We explore here the opportunities and challenges in leveraging SIPs to create a more connected diabetes care ecosystem.", "The SIP promises a series of patient-directed digital technology interventions that have the potential to improve diabetes management decisions for patients in real time, enhance decision-making based on retrospective review, and create future opportunities in data connectivity, ownership, and sharing.", "SIPs Promote Adherence and Safety in Multiple Daily Injections Therapy", "PWD on insulin therapy rely on numeracy skills to make dosing decisions multiple times per day, yet we know that these skills are heterogeneous, and frequently lead to errors in dosing that impact diabetes self-management and glycemic control.26-28", "Bolus advisors (BAs) were developed to assist patients using multiple daily injections (MDI) therapy with the complex decision-making involved in insulin dosing.", "BAs demonstrate benefit in glycemic control and allow patients to take more accurate doses.29-31 Though the evidence base is building for BAs within SIPs, we expect similar positive findings on treatment satisfaction and glycemic control as have been demonstrated previously with bolus calculators.29,31-33", "Missed or delayed boluses are common with MDI therapy34-37 and can negatively impact glycemic control.", "38 SIPs and connected software can be enabled with real-time dosing alerts and reminders. 22 Early observational evidence suggests that SIPs may reduce the frequency of missed mealtime boluses.", "Retrospectively, SIPs can help identify patterns of missed or mistimed meal boluses, providing feedback to the patient.", "39 Further, because SIPs represent ground-truth, precise digital capture of the timing of each insulin dose, when combined with CGM data, these data could enable fine-tuning and personalized improvements on the precise and optimal timing of a meal bolus for an individual.", "A critical aspect of SIPs is to promote safety with insulin dosing. Insulin is a frequent culprit in adverse events primarily related to hypoglycemia from overt dosing errors and also from insulin dose stacking.41,42 By automatically accounting for insulin on board based on captured dose data, SIPs may help reduce hypoglycemia occurrence and associated fear of hypoglycemia.29,32", "At present, most bolus calculators consider ISF, ICR, and DIA, but many other variables impact BG levels and insulin sensitivity, and we expect these will be increasingly incorporated into future calculators.", "43 Personalized suggestions for insulin regimen and dose adjustments based on machine learning, currently possible with insulin pump therapy, should also be leveraged with SIPs.", "To make this possible, data will need to be connected between various devices and cloud systems. For example, CGM data and wearable activity data should directly integrate into the same software tool as insulin dosing.", "One benefit of the digitization of insulin pens is the ability to have software updates. Without any change to the device hardware, vendors can make software upgrades with iterative adjustments to features like algorithms and calculators, as done recently with InPen adding a mode for small, medium, and large mealtime dose calculations rather than dosing only by carbohydrate counting.", "Software updates and their separation from hardware upgrades represents a paradigm shift in medical devices—product upgrade cycles can be dramatically faster, more iterative, and incorporate ongoing learning through agile process, in contrast to long, expensive, multi-year product cycles that can impede innovation.", "In the United States, FDA’s Digital Health Innovation Action Plan is helping to speed existing and create new approvals processes for “software as a medical device.”", "Cost and accessibility of the requisite components for SIP therapy—the smartphone, SIP, and insulin—necessitate ongoing attention.", "Though most adults in the United States have smartphone access, 45 reliance on smartphones for insulin therapy does require that patients and providers have back up plans when phone access is not possible (eg, battery failure, faulty Bluetooth connection, lost phone).", "Programs will be needed to facilitate setup, training, and education on the features of the SIP smartphone applications.", "Additionally, beyond the existing challenges to insulin coverage and access, SIP manufacturers will need to limit pen cost and ensure interoperable functionality across different insulin types.", "Future Considerations for Patients: Data Integration and Data Access", "Individuals in the United States want electronic access to their health data. 46 The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA) gives an individual the right to request all of his or her health data from a covered entity, such as a healthcare payor or provider.", "Bolstering this right, the 21st Century Cures Act of 2016 states that health systems must give patients electronic access to their health data via application-programming interfaces (APIs) “without special effort,” and increasingly health systems are doing so.", "47 However, this right has not yet been applied by federal policy or enforcement to a patient’s right to access his or her own medical device data.", "Device makers are currently left to decide on their own what level of data access to provide to patients.", "Patients should have the ability to use their data personally, to view all their data integrated together, and to share this information with family members, clinicians, or even with researchers if they desire.", "48 A system like Apple Health enables an individual to integrate together different sources of health data into one place, and then direct access to those data for use by any other software application.", "To date, some diabetes device makers have chosen to allow their data to be accessible in Apple Health.", "However, other device makers have chosen to keep their data access proprietary, limiting data access to only those companies with whom they have formed one-to-one business partnerships.", "Without full interoperability and easy API-based access to data, the utility patients can gain from diabetes device data will continue to be limited and restricted.", "As an example, the Companion InPen allows extensive data sharing—insulin dose data are shared with Apple Health as well as with Dexcom.", "This means that a user can choose to view InPen data in either the InPen app, Dexcom’s Clarity software, Tidepool, or Glooko, and conversely, Dexcom CGM data are viewable in the InPen app.", "When data are integrated like this, they are more easily visualized, facilitating more efficient and accurate interpretation (see Figure 2).", "In stark contrast, it is not currently possible to view data from a Freestyle Libre CGM and the Companion InPen in the same data visualization, hindering efficient provision of care for the patients who choose this combination of devices.", "With the digitization of insulin dose history, SIPs can support providers in optimizing diabetes care, with even greater impacts when combined with CGM data.", "Additional work is required for effective team-based care and a satisfactory provider experience.", "Insulin Dosing Data Promotes Active Diabetes Management", "Software-based diabetes data review has been shown to improve diabetes outcomes. 49 Retrospective CGM review can be a powerful educational tool and has been shown to increase patient-provider discussion in clinical visits.", "50 On the other hand, lack of timely data access to facilitate a diabetes visit can lead to therapeutic inertia.", "51 Therefore, by filling data gaps and adding complete and accurate information about insulin dosing data in the context of glucose control, SIPs present an opportunity to facilitate the patient-provider interaction and aid in timely clinical decision-making.", "Issues such as fear, stigma, and cost often drive a patient’s reluctance to use insulin therapy as prescribed.", "52 When using SIPs, discussions about a PWD’s insulin delivery history can be objective, and more easily seen by patient and provider, potentially leading to more frequent and open conversations about patient concerns, reluctance, or other habits around insulin dosing.", "In a recent patient encounter in our practice, a retrospective review of insulin data made it clear that the patient was frequently missing mealtime insulin boluses (see Figure 3).", "After reviewing the SIP report together, and without requiring significant discussion or explanation on part of provider or patient, the patient changed his behavior and increased his frequency of meal-time insulin boluses.", "As new sources of diabetes data emerge and are connected to care, effective engagement of the full diabetes care team is possible.", "In addition to providers, data can also be reviewed by dieticians, diabetes educators, and health coaches to encourage behavior change with food, adherence, or other aspects of daily diabetes management.", "When patients need access to additional support, coaching from digital services is an option.", "Data Integration and Machine Learning Will Augment Diabetes Management", "While providers benefit from the additional data captured by SIPs and are better able to fine-tune individualized treatment parameters, this work takes time and energy.", "Humans are inherently unable to leverage the vast quantities of available data. Machine learning may prove to be more effective and efficient in reviewing the data and aiding in recommending adjustments to insulin settings.", "To date, companies exist to do this for hospitalized patients on insulin infusions53-55 and for outpatients using insulin pumps,56,57 and we expect to see similar technology emerge to better aid in interpretation and titration of insulin pen doses.", "While tailored adjustments of insulin dosing regimens have traditionally been the job of an Endocrinologist, advanced decision support driven by machine learning may increasingly empower primary care providers to care for patients using complex MDI therapy.", "Provider Experience and Clinic Integration Need to be Optimized", "Currently, routine integration of diabetes devices into office-based care is inefficient and cumbersome.", "Broad uptake of these new devices will require a focus on data accessibility and usability for the clinic staff, provider, and clinical team, with improvements required in several areas (see Table 2):", "| 1.

Prescribing an InPen to date has required an order form that asks for insulin dose settings much like an insulin pump start form.", "This may erect a barrier to prescribing from a broader set of providers who may be intimidated by this or put off by the friction and time required.", "(5) Easily onboard patients to connect their data to cloud and clinic accounts. Investing time upfront to help patients share data, connect devices, and learn how to access retrospective data is time-saving and will facilitate telehealth-based digital care delivery.", "(6) Automate reminders to patients to connect or upload data before a check-in, avoiding clinic visit time wasted trying to upload device data.", "As the focus in health care increasingly shifts toward high value care, allocating resources strategically within a group of patients becomes important.", "One could foresee identifying patients with poor diabetes control, frequent healthcare utilization, or otherwise medically complex as ideal candidates to receive SIP therapy.", "With the digital tools to promote insulin safety, high risk patient groups may benefit from SIP use.", "Objective data capture allows better evaluation of adherence, and providers can more closely offer support.", "It has been shown with insulin pump therapy that individuals with poor diabetes control and those considered medically complex still benefit from the technology,60,61 and we expect the same to apply with SIPs.", "Just as CGM data can be used to stratify patients into risk categories, 62 and as insulin pump reports have been used to identify behavioral patterns, SIP data could similarly be used.", "A clinic dashboard could identify PWD who are frequently missing boluses and allow targeted outreach to promote improved dosing strategies.", "The dashboard could identify those with sudden changes in insulin usage and escalate their care to a provider.", "We could identify people who consistently struggle with carbohydrate estimation and offer focused education.", "Achieving these opportunities also requires a connected data ecosystem where population-level dashboards enable simultaneous visualization of aggregated data from the EHR, CGM, and SIPs.", "The Future of Connected Care Is Increasingly Asynchronous and Continuous", "Current typical practice involves a periodic clinic visit at standard intervals, which may then take advantage of data review from devices.", "In the future, patient care should involve more targeted, frequent, data-driven check-ins leveraging glucose monitoring and insulin dosing data.", "To meet this future state, every diabetes device must contain the ability for seamless, passive, real-time data flow.", "63 Cloud-based continuous streaming of data allows patients to be connected with care teams and offers the possibility for asynchronous, virtual connection.", "For example, after an initial synchronous consultation, subsequent care could be conducted asynchronously and virtually, with integrated SIP and CGM data reviewed within a few weeks of the original visit.", "64 These easier, quicker interactions might drive more frequent check-ins and reduce clinical inertia.", "Shifting to a model of care driven by patient need, rather than by provider availability and clinic schedules will require systemic changes.", "Providers will need new reimbursement models, along with sufficient time, and administrative and leadership support.", "The SIP, as a connected digital diabetes tool, has the potential to improve diabetes care for millions of PWD on insulin therapy (see Table 3).", "Users of SIPs benefit from digital tools that provide easier insulin dose calculation, dose reminders, and facilitate hypoglycemia avoidance.", "Iterative software updates will speed new benefits to SIP users.

Steven Pacelli, DexCom’s executive VP of strategy and corporate development, said that a 2016 rollout of the G5 system for Android is “certainly plausible,” but it would depend on how long FDA takes to review the system’s application.", "Sayer added that an application for G6 technology could be in front of U.S. regulators as early as May.", "Key to DexCom’s pipeline moving forward is the company’s partnership with Verily, a collaboration laying the groundwork for DexCom’s long-term goals.", "“We are making some strategic investments to position this company long term,” said Sayer at the JPM conference.", "“We are investing in our partnership with Verily to really change the face of CGM over time.”", "DexCom’s CGM endgame, according to Sayer, is a miniaturized, disposable CGM that incorporates battery, processor, and a Bluetooth Radio — a feat the CEO claims is possible in 5 years.", "“This is where CGM is headed, folks,” said Sayer. “Something the size of a penny that will sit on your body and be disposable.", "Sayer projected that investors would start to see dividends from the DexCom/Verily partnership in 2018, with the launch of their first collaborative product.", "Additional strategic investments include a new European headquarters in Edinburgh to expand DexCom’s European foothold, and a new sensor manufacturing facility in Arizona."]}

The company doesn’t just want to produce incrementally “good” products; they strive for remarkable.", "They want awesome. And their recipe for success is a relentless focus on providing solutions for the specific problems faced by diabetics.", "Interestingly, they combine this narrow focus on diabetics with a broad view on the myriad technologies that may be required to provide innovative solutions to their problems.", "Dexcom seems to have found a way to get the innovation payoffs of narrow focus and deep customer expertise, while avoiding the incremental improvement mindset that often comes with those strengths.", "Having a tight focus on the problems you are trying to solve, Sayer emphasizes, is critical for an entrepreneurial company in his sector.", "If you hope to achieve anything unprecedented in a field as well established and researched as health management, you must deeply understand the problem and be well versed in prior art.", "Engineers at Dexcom invest a lot of time in staying current on the relevant science and technology. When such deep knowledge is required to innovate, a company has to wisely choose its focal point.", "“We haven't tried to make a whole bunch of different products and attack a whole bunch of different industries,” Sayer says.", "“We've known what problem we've wanted to solve, and really designed technology to do that.”", "Highly focused firms like Dexcom are also well positioned to gain deep familiarity with their customers – always an advantage for innovators.", "“We probably have the most patient-focused culture of a medical device company I've ever been around,” says Sayer.", "“Our team spends a tremendous amount of time with physicians and patients out in the field.” And Dexcom’s commitment to understanding patients’ perspectives goes much deeper than conversation.", "“We're all human pincushions,” he says, who are willing to “wear glucose sensor technology to experience what the customers experience.”", "(He quickly assures us that no one is defying FDA regulations by doing so.)", "See the full list of Most Innovative Growth Companies for 2017 here.", "Even though Dexcom pays attention to a narrow range of customer problems, it develops deep expertise in a broad set of technologies to generate innovative solutions.", "The company relies on people with very different expertise to collaborate on different aspects of a product simultaneously.", "According to Sayer, this is the most innovative aspect of Dexcom’s approach. “Developing a continuous glucose monitoring solution requires ingenuity on many fronts.", "Anything that ends with ‘engineer,’ we have,” Sayer says. “We have chemical engineers, electrical engineers, mechanical engineers, software engineers, human factors engineers …” and as these various experts make progress at different paces, “one generation or one innovation might focus on the software and the algorithm … and other times, we'll go through the chemistry side, and the membranes on the sensor.”", "Applying deep expertise in a wide variety of technologies by different groups allows Dexcom to rapidly iterate toward better solutions.", "And the company doesn’t shy away from innovating at any time during the product life cycle. As an example, Sayer cites the latest generation G5 mobile system which came about when “our algorithm guys said, ‘Hey, we have better software,’” and their innovation was quickly integrated, “making it much more accurate than anything else without changing the rest of the system.”", "While Dexcom has built deep expertise in a wide mixture of technologies, it still partners with outside firms to broaden the set of technologies even further.", "For example, Verily Life Sciences, a subsidiary of Google parent company Alphabet, is a key partner. Sayer reports that, from an innovation standpoint, the collaboration with Verily “has really been a good thing for us ….", "We weren't used to a Verily-type pace, and the way Verily people look at projects is different than traditional medical device people.”", "For example, “when they're done with something, they want to launch it tomorrow,” says Sayer. Another difference is that they tend to think big, really big.", "Verily’s criterion for starting a project, he says, is that it should have the potential to produce an offering that is “ten times better than what's already on the market.”", "To do that, you have to shoot for remarkable. The focus on producing something new that is order of magnitudes better than what’s on the market pushes Dexcom to use every technology possible to produce a breakthrough.", "Although many factors contribute to Dexcom’s innovative prowess, this interplay between focusing tightly on a narrow set of customer problems, while drawing widely on a variety of technologies, is a critical component.", "This combination helps Dexcom generate innovations that leap beyond incremental improvements to established methods.", "Sayer explains. “It's very comfortable to do marginal improvements, and just keep doing marginal improvements, and not take any risks.”", "Every young company’s journey to the Forbes Most Innovative Growth Companies list is different.

(67), the standardized AGP report was further developed by the International Diabetes Center and now incorporates all the core CGM metrics and targets along with a 14-day composite glucose profile as an integral component of clinical decision making (24).", "This recommendation was later endorsed at the aforementioned international consensus conference on CGM metrics (18) and is referenced as an example in the American Diabetes Association 2019 “Standards of Medical Care in Diabetes” (16) and in an update to the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists consensus on use of CGM (68).", "The AGP report, in slightly modified formats, has been adopted by most of the CGM device manufacturers in their download software.", "An example of the AGP report, updated to incorporate targets, is presented in Fig. 2.

Although time constraints and reimbursement issues are clearly obstacles, clinician inexperience in data interpretation and lack of standardization software for visualization of CGM data have also played a role (73).", "The proposed standardized report enables clinicians to readily identify important metrics such as the percentage of time spent within, below, and above each individual’s target range, allowing for greater personalization of therapy through shared decision making.", "Using the standardized report, the clinician can also address glucose variability (e.g., the coefficient of variation [%CV] metric) (74) or use the glucose management indicator (GMI) metric (75) to discuss the possible discrepancies noted in glucose exposure derived from CGM data versus the individual’s laboratory-measured A1C (41,76).", "With appropriate educational materials, time, and experience, clinicians will develop a systematic approach to CGM data analysis and the most effective ways to discuss the data with patients in person or remotely.", "Numerous studies have demonstrated the clinical benefits of early achievement of near-normal glycemic control in individuals with type 1 diabetes and type 2 diabetes (77–83).", "However, when advising people with diabetes, goal-setting must be collaborative and take into account the individual needs/capabilities of each patient and start with the goals that are most achievable.", "An early study by DeWalt et al. (84) found that setting small, achievable goals not only enhances people’s ability to cope with their diabetes, but that people with diabetes who set and achieved their goals often initiated additional behavioral changes on their own.", "One approach to consider is the SMART goal (Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, Time-bound) intervention, which is directly applicable to setting targets for time in ranges.", "First described by Lawlor and Hornyak in 2012 (85), this approach incorporates four key components of behavioral change relevant to goal setting: 1) the goal is specific and defines exactly what is to be achieved, 2) the goal is measurable and there is tangible evidence when it has been achieved, 3) the goal is achievable but stretches the patient slightly so that he/she feels challenged, and 4) the goal should be attainable over a short period of time.", "Effective goals should utilize CGM data to identify specific instances for the patient to take measurable action to prevent hypoglycemia.", "Although analysis of the AGP reports provides an opportunity for meaningful discussion, individuals should be counseled to look at patterns throughout the day to see when low glucose events are occurring and make adjustments in their therapy to reduce these events.", "When applying the CGM metrics in clinical practice, it may be more meaningful and motivating to communicate to people with diabetes the importance of working to reduce the time spent <70 mg/dL (<3.9 mmol/L) to less than 1 h per day and time spent <54 mg/dL (<3.0 mmol/L) to less than 15 min per day, rather than using <4% and <1%, respectively, as the goal.", "However, as discussed earlier, targets must be personalized to meet the needs and capabilities of each person, focusing on small steps and small successes.", "Individuals with diabetes should work with their provider and/or educator to develop a SMART goal to reduce TBR.", "Individualized goals are particularly important for pediatric and young adult populations. The International Society for Pediatric and Adolescent Diabetes recommends that targets for individuals ≤25 years of age aim for the lowest achievable A1C without undue exposure to severe hypoglycemia or negative effects on quality of life and burden of care (86).", "An A1C target of 7.0% (53 mmol/mol) can be used in children, adolescents, and adults ≤25 years old who have access to comprehensive care (86).", "However, a higher A1C goal (e.g., <7.5% [<58 mmol/mol]) may be more appropriate in the following situations: inability to articulate hypoglycemia symptoms, hypoglycemia unawareness, history of severe hypoglycemia, lack of access to analog insulins and/or advanced insulin delivery technology, or inability to regularly check glucose (86).", "This would equate to a TIR target of ∼60% (Table 4).", "The consensus group recognized that achieving the targets for the various time in ranges is aspirational in some situations, and many individuals will require ongoing support, both educational and technological, from their health care team.", "Importantly, as demonstrated by Beck et al. (26), Vigersky and McMahon (27), and Feig et al. (59), even small, incremental improvements yield significant glycemic benefits.", "Therefore, when advising individuals with diabetes (particularly children, adolescents, and high-risk individuals) about their glycemic goals, it is important to take a stepwise approach, emphasizing that what may appear to be small, incremental successes (e.g., 5% increase in TIR) are, in fact, clinically significant in improving their glycemia (26,27,59).", "However, when counseling women planning pregnancy and pregnant women, greater emphasis should be placed on getting to goal as soon as possible (59,60).", "Use of CGM continues to expand in clinical practice. As a component of diabetes self-management, daily use of CGM provides the ability to obtain immediate feedback on current glucose levels as well as direction and rate of change in glucose levels.", "This information allows people with diabetes to optimize dietary intake and exercise, make informed therapy decisions regarding mealtime and correction of insulin dosing, and, importantly, react immediately and appropriately to mitigate or prevent acute glycemic events (87–89).", "Retrospective analysis of CGM data, using standardized data management tools such as the AGP, enables clinicians and people with diabetes to work collaboratively in identifying problem areas and then set achievable goals (70–72).", "We conclude that, in clinical practice, time in ranges (within target range, below range, above range) are both appropriate and useful as clinical targets and outcome measurements that complement A1C for a wide range of people with diabetes and that the target values specified in this article should be considered an integral component of CGM data analysis and day-to-day treatment decision making.", "Acknowledgments.

You announced a partnership with Livongo, and something with [Eli] Lilly [and Company]?", "Lilly had been announced earlier. We formalized a relationship with Lilly where we’ve been working for quite some time to develop interconnected devices with Lilly as they develop insulin delivery systems.", "They have pens that are going to have Bluetooth connection capability and they’re working on an insulin delivery system as well for themselves, and our CGM will be integrated into the software platforms that they built.", "So we’ll provide them CGM data and patients will be able to view CGM data on their apps.", "And the Livongo announcement, that’s a data relationship. You know Livongo has a coaching platform and they coach patients based on, right now, fingersticks.", "Our relationship with them is through our APIs. And what we will do is provide them data, and their coaches and analytics can go through the CGM data and see if there’s recommendations that they would offer patients based upon what they see there.", "We believe it will provide a much richer experience for those patients.", "Livongo’s interesting. They got a lot of press this year because of their IPO, and a lot of people are aware of the space they’re in who weren’t before.", "But on the hardware side, they’re not super sophisticated; it’s just a white-labeled glucometer that has been around for ages.", "So it’s interesting to see them connecting to parts of the industry where the technology is cutting edge, like Dexcom.", "We’re glad we’re connecting to them. We’ve certainly worked with and spoken to others. Onduo, Verily’s diabetes management platform, has been taking data from us to power their stuff forever.", "I presented some UnitedHealthcare data yesterday in my presentation whereby they’re working on developing diabetes data and metrics based on CGM data.", "And we’ve even done some of this stuff on our own. So we’re looking at every possible angle to grow our business and provide patients with what they want.", "If patients truly want a Livongo experience and their software is better than anything we can develop, then — look, they’re buying sensors, they’re using our sensors, it’s all good.", "And we have to look at what are we best at. What we’re best at is making great sensors and making sensors that are safe and sensors that are accurate.", "And we’re good at the app we’ve created and the stuff we’ve done.", "But if somebody wants to make a sensor for some completely different use in a market they understand better than us, why not serve up our sensor data to them and let them put it in that platform?", "I’ve been talking to several folks in the diabetes space the last couple days here at JPM about how incredibly fast the space has moved in the past five years.", "It’s moved incredibly fast in the past five years. Because that’s when we were the first company to ever go to the phone.", "We went directly to the mobile platform in 2015. And once that happened, all these avenues are open because you now have data that can go from a body to a server that’s real medical data.", "One of our board members said something really interesting. I’m a doctor, I’ve been at this forever, but CGM really is what personalized medicine was supposed to be when we started way back when.", "And this is where you have an opportunity to create personalized medicine for people with actionable information out of this data.", "Watching you guys, Abbott, Medtronic and Senseonics to some extent — there’s something of a market share race going on, right?", "Let’s take a step back. We’ve grown remarkably over the last couple years. We’re over 40% growth, compounded every year since 2010.", "So our growth trajectory has been nothing short of remarkable. Our strategy has been to make our product very much fit within the Type 1 market for insulin-using patients and to seek reimbursement.", "We’ve not rolled out highly-expensive cash pay platforms or gone the commercial route that many of our competitors have at this point in time.", "I think over the next several years you’ll see us move that way. They have grabbed a bunch of patients in Europe, but our Europe business is growing nicely too.", "And you do have a well-known brand and a relationship with patients.", "We do! And if we do something wrong, they’re also very happy to let us know. It’s OK.", "What does 2020 look like for you? What are you excited about?", "The first thing we’re excited about is we’re going to double our G6, our current product manufacturing capacity, again this year.", "We have been capacity-constrained ever since we launched that product. So we’ve not been able to go do some of the aggressive commercial things that we would have liked to have done as far as getting word out to more people.", "Has that bottleneck been on the manufacturing side?", "It has — not only with us, but with our component suppliers. So we’re beefing up our supply chain as well as our internal stuff.", "We do have a big G7 year planned. We’ve finalized our product configuration and we’re down pretty much to the end on that where we should be.", "We’ll start our clinical studies and execute those.", "But our 2020 launch is going to be a limited launch; it’s not going to be a big launch. If we’ve learned one lesson from the G6 platform, it’s that we can’t possibly launch this product when we’re not ready to produce tens of millions of them.", "With G6 we got an early approval and rather than wait until we’d built up a bunch of inventory we rolled it out.", "And we’ve been running out of product every month ever since, pretty much. We’re not going to do that again.", "When we get G7 approved, what we’re going to do is we’re going to build up inventory and when we launch it we’ll turn on the faucet and have availability across the board.", "So that’s more of a 2021 event rather than a 2020 event.", "What’s the big leap from G6 to G7, especially in terms of patient experience?", "The first thing they get is size. The G7, it’s smaller than a [Freestyle] Libre. It is probably in diameter a little smaller than a quarter, a little bigger than a nickel, and it doesn’t sit up very high.", "It is very easy to use — it’s literally a two-step insertion.", "We’re working on a longer-labeled application, 14 or 15 days. That length of wear will be determined by the accuracy of the data.", "Our current product is a 10-day standard. So we’ll see. That’s currently the plan of record to get it out that far.", "It’s just a different experience for our patients. Right now for example we have a transmitter that pops in, so you have to buy a transmitter and a sensor.", "No more transmitters. It’s one thing, you peel it off, you pop it in. You don’t have to put anything together.", "Does it have a separate receiver or go straight to the phone?", "We will offer a separate receiver because there are patients who don’t want to go to the phone. But we’ll also have it go straight to the phone.", "Getting smaller, lasting longer, getting more accurate — is that where this space is now? Is it almost like phones, just a bigger camera, or are there still paradigm-shifting changes to come?", "That is such a wonderful question. I’m glad you asked me that. I think, based on the performance of our sensor, while we are very good there are things we could do better.", "But we’re quite a ways down the path. The things we can make better going forward are very well-known to us; they’re very well-known to our patients.", "You want to eliminate anything that’s an outlier. Our algorithm is designed to pick up outliers and shut them down, but there may be an occasional one where it doesn’t.", "So if you could eliminate the big negative experience that’s a good thing.", "Certainly, improving experience within various ranges and on various days — these [challenges] are small compared to the problems we’re used to solving.", "The G7 is a very small physical footprint, I don’t know that we need to go much smaller than that. What’s going to be interesting going forward is this becomes a software and a data thing.", "This becomes about providing the patient with the experience they want.", "So for example, I had somebody in earlier who has two daughters with Type 1 diabetes. His vision of what he wants and what his daughters want is a CGM that connects with pumps, connects with phones, that has all this science and algorithms so his daughters never have to do anything, so they have a fully-automated insulin delivery system.", "Our Tandem Control IQ joint product that came out late last year is a step along that path.", "There are patients who want that and we need to offer a product that will meet those needs nicely. There are others who don’t.", "There are others who are going to want a pen that’s connected to an app and maybe manage that way. ...", "But if we can create an experience whereby we can, in a very thoughtful way, meet the needs of all patients, I don’t think that’s 10 software iterations [away], but I don’t think it’s one either.", "When we talk about paradigm shifts, I have to ask: Is noninvasive a pipe dream?", "With any technology I ask another question first: What does invasive mean? Invasive, the way people define it, means they’re afraid of needles.", "So I want you to think of something. I’m wearing a G7 on my arm right now. Just touch that. Is there anything invasive about that?", "So when they’re solving the invasive problem, they’re not really solving a problem, because a needle puts a sensor in you but that sensor is the width of a hair, it goes in on a very shallow basis, it doesn’t hurt.", "So what are you solving by creating a noninvasive platform unless you get wild accuracy?", "There are three problems to solve in sensors: If you can make it perform better than the other guys, or as good; if you make it more convenient; and if you significantly reduce the cost.", "So if one of those three things happen and you can maintain the other two, you have a product offering.", "I’ve never seen anything on the noninvasive side that meets the performance standards. It may be low cost if you’ve got it reading from your watch, but if it doesn’t achieve performance it doesn’t matter.", "We look at all of them. We’re not blind to them, but we haven’t seen them make a difference. And if one of them did?", "Quite candidly, we’d look real hard at making it part of our product family because we’re not going to give the space up easily.", "I had another question about moving into the Type 2 market — is that a clinically motivated thing or is it more of a business move?", "People with Type 2 diabetes are diagnosed and they’re given a pill and told \"walk more, eat less and take this.\"", "And over time they get worse and worse and worse, and by the time you intervene sometimes it’s even too late.", "You learn more from one sensor session than you ever learn from any of these fingersticks, and when these patients are provided with information they do incredibly well.", "We saw in my presentation yesterday the improvement in the program at UnitedHealth Group, how much better a patient was after going through their program.", "Average glucose values, glucose spikes, everything goes down.", "We saw another pilot from Intermountain Healthcare where they just took a small group of 100 patients — 50 on the CGM full time, 50 on meters.", "They believe the annual cost savings in the CGM was $5,000 a year per patient, based on hospitalizations, lab tests, drug costs, doctor visits, phone calls.", "Look, we’d be disingenuous to say everything isn’t business-motivated, because it is. We’re a company.", "But we look at a Type 2 population around the country that’s much larger than the Type 1 population and the interaction with those people is more recommendation, it’s more education, it’s more diagnostic.", "Versus in our Type 1 and our Type 2 intensive insulin populations, it’s fully integrated into drug delivery and dosing a drug.", "Look at the Type 2 drugs that are out. Next time you go home and watch television, there are more ads for Type 2 diabetes drugs than any drug out on the market.", "They spend a fortune on Type 2 diabetes drug advertising — Novo, Lilly, Novartis, everybody. Their Type 2 drugs are everywhere because this condition is so rampant and people are afraid of getting on insulin, but we don’t know when the right time to put a patient on insulin is.", "Well, you learn that by putting on a CGM [and tracking their condition]. When the drugs don’t work anymore, it’s time to make a change.", "Or if they don’t work anymore because you’re eating horribly or you’re not exercising, you need to try this or we’re going to move you to insulin.", "So there’s a diagnostic element here, but there’s also an element where the patients just do better. It becomes a question of getting reimbursement and getting a product and a payment [model] whereby payers will pay for it.", "We have found in all of our experiences all over the world that when our product is reimbursed we do fabulously well.", "Unless it’s extremely inexpensive, cash pay to have a consistent market is hard. So we’ve got to develop our dataset and we’ll continue to work with all of these companies, with the insurance companies, with Onduo, with Livongo.", "We’ve got multiple irons in the fire and we’ll figure it out. For us the important thing is that they all wear Dexcom sensors.", "We haven’t talked much about all the things we accoplished last year. $1.47 billion off a billion-dollar year.", "That type of organic growth you just don’t see. And that kind of organic growth given all the things — if you’ve listened to all our earning calls you’ve heard all the statements we’ve made about what a struggle it was for us to have enough manufacturing capacity.", "Scaling this technology is not simple. Yes, everyone’s trying to get here, but the sheer capital it takes and the money; … it’s easy to build 10,000 sensors.", "It’s not easy to build 20 million. So we’ve learned and we’ve had these inflection points and this year was another one.", "I think we’re positioned to do good things in 2020 and beyond.", "That’s what you call a \"good problem,\" right? Everyone wants your product but you can’t make it fast enough?", "You know, people say that to me all the time, but I think with our device it’s the most horrible problem you can possibly imagine.", "Because with our device, our patients’ very lives depend on it and when they have to wait seven days for the next one, I don’t have an answer.", "So, it is a good problem if you’re in the car business. It’s a good problem if you’re selling iPhones.", "It’s not a good problem if someone needs your sensors or they’re going to die, so I don’t want that problem any more ever again."]}

For example, in 2020, the total monthly clinic logins increased from 71,012 to 95,088, which was a 34% increase from January to July.", "Compared with 2019, the YOY increase in monthly total logins was between 49% for January and 99% for June.", "Between April and July, the YOY change in logins was higher than expected with at least 70% YOY increase each month.", "These data suggest that clinics increased their use of CLARITY to manage their patients with diabetes in response to the pandemic.", "Use of rtCGM in place of point-of-care testing for glucose management in the hospital", "rtCGM is currently not Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved in the United States for inpatient hospital use, and point-of-care (POC) testing has been the standard of care for glucose management.", "There has been ongoing expert discussion on uses of CGM in the inpatient setting for both intensive care unit (ICU) and non-ICU.45,46 Use of older CGM models in the hospital setting was prohibited because of barriers such as poor accuracy, need for calibration, interference from acetaminophen use, sensor drift, and measurement lag.45 However, newer rtCGM devices, such as the Dexcom G6, have eliminated these barriers and achieve accuracy levels below a mean absolute relative difference (MARD) of 10%.47 Recent studies where non-ICU patients were randomized to rtCGM or POC testing showed rtCGM resulted in improved glycemic management for patients with T2D,48 and decreased hypoglycemia for high-risk insulin-treated patients with T2D.49", "Because diabetes is associated with increased risk for morbidity and mortality for patients in the hospital infected with COVID-19,20,50 the pandemic has created an urgency to determine the feasibility of CGM in the hospital.51,52 On April 1, 2020, the FDA exercised “enforcement discretion” of CGM use in hospitals because they determined the risk to patients was low.", "This decision allowed hospitals to use CGM for remote monitoring of patients to reduce personal protective equipment use and limit health care workers' exposure to the virus.53", "Several recent publications report on inpatient hospital use of CGM during the COVID-19 pandemic. An earlier pilot study tested the feasibility of CGM in the hospital for noncritically ill COVID-19 patients and found high accuracy and reduced POC testing.54 Shehav-Zaltzman et al. described the use of CGM in two hospital isolation wards where monitoring stations were created using CGM systems.55 They found CGM for remote real-time diabetes management feasible and added to the quality of care while minimizing health care work exposure risk.", "A case report on a severely ill patient with diabetes and pneumonia caused by COVID-19 demonstrated successful use of Dexcom G4 rtCGM for remote monitoring of the patient to track glucose levels from outside the patient's isolation room.56 These studies emphasized the added infrastructure needs for safe implementation of CGM in the hospital, including staff education, establishing protocols for device placement and replacement, monitoring device accuracy, and integrating CGM readings into the medical record.57", "Heeding Churchill's famous admonition for future generations to “never let a good crisis go to waste,” we conclude by discussing ways in which the changes wrought by COVID-19 from a health care, policy, and economics perspective are likely to endure long after the pandemic subsides.", "If the operative question for society is how to achieve meaningful ROI in the midst of crisis, to see that the incremental 20% health care spend attributable to COVID-19 and diabetes leads to sustainable change that makes medical practice more efficient and equitable, then we believe the winner in this whole experience will be the accelerated use and adoption of technology as the de facto “new normal” post-COVID-19.", "First, from a health care and policy perspective, clearly the twin rise of telehealth services in medicine broadly and the use of rtCGM in the diabetes market specifically as discussed in this article have demonstrated their value proposition to providers, patients, payers, and regulators.", "All of the R&D investment that such technologies are leveraging has been put to the test in the most exigent of circumstances and shown safety and efficacy across nearly every performance indicator.", "Although industry and the clinic seem to have moved forward in technology adoption, as well as the overall marketplace, regulators and policy makers will need to carefully articulate the appropriate guardrails and safeguards for such technologies to ensure compliance, mitigate abuse, maintain safety standards, and encourage future innovation.", "This approach would ensure that today's inflection point in technology will not be undercut by intractable privacy or security concerns and would rather continue the journey toward a more technology-enabled and efficient future in health care delivery and practice.", "Moreover, the pandemic has acutely highlighted health care disparities based on socioeconomic factors, an area where technology could have a significant positive impact if deployed strategically and with appropriate regulatory backing.58 For example, CMS has loosened requirements for obtaining CGM during the COVID-19 pandemic such as not having to go to the doctor's office to receive CGM and not having to demonstrate use of four finger sticks a day, a requirement for CGM eligibility.", "Making these regulatory changes permanent will help increase access to CGM for those who can benefit from the technology.", "In addition, even though, at present, 35 states provide some coverage for CGM through Medicaid, expanding Medicaid coverage for CGM to all states for patients taking insulin for diabetes will help to close socioeconomic disparity gaps for those in the United States without private health insurance.", "Beyond policy change for reimbursement of health technologies such as CGM, disparities in access to health technologies continue to exist when access to diabetes specialists and diabetes educators is limited in areas of socioeconomic deprivation.59", "Second, by virtue of their forward-looking orientation, the capital markets and investment community have already moved forward in assigning winners and losers in the post-COVID-19 world.", "The winners are indisputably companies and organizations that place technology at the center of what they do—consider that over the past year, at the time of this writing, the S&P Technology Index is up 44% while the S&P 500 overall index is up 18%, and that all of the equity market growth this year has been driven by large-cap technology companies.60 Stock markets are forward-looking barometers of risk and help reveal the market consensus on future trends.", "As another example of what the post-COVID-19 world will look like, Salesforce announced on 12/1 its acquisition of Slack Technologies, a business communications and virtual workload software tool, for $28 billion.61 That this transaction would be announced 9 months into a global pandemic and would represent the largest ever acquisition by Salesforce, a $200B market cap global technology leader, underscores the gravity of the secular change envisioned in technology use in the new world post-COVID-19.", "As we have discussed, these changes are also bearing fruit in the health care world, where the growth in the reliance on technology to provide care during the pandemic is changing incumbent ways of doing business and will likely lead to positive ROI.", "At the Cleveland Clinic, for example, the population health analytics team is using algorithms proactively to reduce COVID-19 hospitalizations by 7.5%, geomapping COVID-19 exposures to determine hotspots before even health officials have such data on their radar, and using technology to enable value-based work at scale.62 Similarly, we have highlighted successful use cases of rtCGM during the pandemic to manage diabetes safely and effectively, which can continue to add value post-COVID-19.", "We envision more such success stories across the health care landscape and in diabetes especially. With the right set of policies and infrastructure in place, COVID-19 may transform the health care system to better serve the broader public's needs in an economically efficient way over the next 100 years.", "S.G. is an employee of Western Digital Corp.

AI is a significant driver of decentralized care.", "Diabetes is still the therapeutic area that sets the pace for the digital health market. In the last year, we’ve seen the market success of Dexcom and Tandem’s interoperable system illustrating that it isn’t devices alone but interoperable, patient-centered networks of devices and data analytics that capture market share.", "Other companies in the health care ecosystem seem to be rethinking the business model. Consider Mercy, which has pursued the idea of a bedless hospital based on remote monitoring, predictive analytics and integrated clinician teams.", "Other leading providers and payers are working to integrate data, too.", "Building a viable long-term model for health care data may require companies to embrace an open data architecture that can incorporate core elements such as electronic health records without being constrained by legacy products.", "Payers, too, continue to try and reinvent the business model, with UnitedHealthcare and Aetna, for example, pursuing value-based approaches.", "While these trends are all significant for the future of medtech’s business model, the challenge for companies is to identify what steps they can take now to prepare themselves for the emergence of a more data-driven, digital era in health care."]}

more recently, however, leading medtech firms have been changing the way they approach innovation and the types of solutions they are focused on.", "In particular, many players are increasingly relying on M&A deals to enable outsourced and networked models for device development.", "Under such models, companies are reducing the proportion of their investments that is dedicated to in-house R&D, instead favoring mergers and acquisitions, joint ventures, co-development partnerships, capital-only funding investments, or innovation hub sponsorships to incorporate novel products into their portfolios.", "Relative to in-house R&D, networked innovation models can be more cost-effective, lower-risk, and can lead to more effective and relevant product developments due to the collaboration of various industry stakeholders.", "In addition, these models are increasingly involving non-traditional industry partners such as technology companies, which have been enthusiastically working with medical device companies to bring innovations to the fields of health app development, telemedicine, AI, robotics, 3-D printing, and other cutting-edge healthcare technologies.", "For both medical device approval and market access, evidence thresholds are evolving globally, driven by regulatory changes designed to improve patient safety and device effectiveness and to enable healthcare systems to better cope with cost constraints and the advent of new technologies.", "More specifically, this means that being able to prove safety relative to an equivalent offering will no longer represent a sufficient threshold for market access; regulations are gradually evolving to require comparative studies, longer-term data, and evidence packages that include demonstrations of economic and clinical benefit.", "It is also important to note that providers are increasingly analyzing the value that a new medical device will offer based on a broader set of questions than in the past.", "So, in addition to evaluating treatment effectiveness and cost when making purchasing decisions, providers will also consider factors such as readmission reduction, operational efficiencies, discharge compliance, and various other aspects of patient satisfaction.", "Macrotrend 2: Increased Demand for and Access to Innovative Therapies", "New Treatment Paradigms and Expedited Market Access Initiatives", "As companies continue to develop innovative and disruptive technologies, treatment paradigms are shifting, and patients and providers alike are increasingly calling for improved access to such products; many regulatory bodies are thus introducing initiatives to expedite the availability of new technologies on the market.", "One example of this is the FDA’s Breakthrough Device Designation Program, which prioritizes submissions of medical devices and combination products that have the potential to improve treatment for life-threatening and other debilitating conditions.", "Since its introduction, this program has helped increase the number of innovative medical devices approved annually in the US.", "In Europe, on the other hand, the upcoming implementation of the MDR, which includes stricter safety and effectiveness provisions than its predecessor, may hinder access to innovative products in the short term.", "However, the improved safety and effectiveness requirements of these new regulations are expected to ultimately support confidence in the products that are available on the market and subsequently support the uptake of innovative devices and products.", "The challenges faced by the EU in introducing these regulations over recent years illustrate the difficulty of balancing patient safety with providing access to innovative therapies, which remains one of the central challenges in regulating medtech innovation worldwide.", "Nonetheless, innovative therapies continue to be developed at a faster rate than ever before, and regulatory bodies will therefore continue to seek out methods of providing patients with access to the most effective treatments while maintaining patient safety and satisfaction.", "Companies that are well prepared to cope with treatment paradigm shifts, particularly those that are the forefront of innovation efforts, will be well positioned for future success in this space.", "Potentially the most pivotal aspect of this macrotrend is that patients are gradually playing a larger role in treatment decision making and design, driving increased consumer responsibility and engagement.", "This is partly due to the increased cost-sharing burden that patients have assumed, as well as improved access to information that allows patients to be more involved in care decisions, such as sources from regulatory bodies, patient-directed websites, and patient forums.", "In addition, patients are also becoming more involved in regulatory processes; the FDA’s CDRH, for instance, oversees a patient engagement advisory committee and now considers patient preference and patient-report outcomes in regulatory decision making.", "Other regulatory bodies, such as those in Australia, are gradually moving in this direction as well.", "Companies are also increasingly relying on patients to improve product design; for example, GE Healthcare redesigned its mammography machines with the help of patients, resulting in a remote control that allows patients to control the amount and speed of breast compression, which has been shown to enable increased compression, thereby improving imaging and diagnostic capabilities.", "Macrotrend 3: Evolution of Delivery and Payment Models", "Spurred by cost constraints and an ongoing shift toward value-based care, consolidation and vertical integration are being increasingly used in order to increase efficiency and purchasing power and to share risk and align incentives across the value chain.", "This is best exemplified by independent hospitals that continue to join health systems, even outside of metropolitan centers.", "Moreover, acquisitions are increasingly featuring outpatient facilities, such as community-based physician practices and ambulatory surgical centers.", "This is driven primarily by the growth of outpatient treatment volumes, which has in recent years surpassed that of hospital treatment volumes due to the increased availability of minimally invasive treatments that can be performed in non-hospital settings, as well as generally heightened patient convenience and improved cost effectiveness in outpatient settings.", "As a result, a number of providers – including HCA healthcare, the largest health system in the US – have been working to bolster their focus on ASC and physician practice acquisitions.", "Payers are also consolidating into larger national systems in order to increase scale, efficiency, and leverage on costs.", "Additionally, payers are routing patients to their preferred IDNs, particularly those that align with them on costs and outcomes.", "This has increased the willingness of providers to assume risk and work with payers as partners.", "Furthermore, there is also a movement toward vertical integration in the healthcare industry, which has supported new partnerships and acquisitions across different types of stakeholders along the healthcare value chain.", "This is mainly due to the potential for greater cost savings, outcomes improvements, more effective risk sharing, and more coordinated care afforded by the combination of various stakeholders into large, overarching entities.", "Vertical integration has been mostly driven by payers, such as UnitedHealth Group, which owns Optum—a company that includes providers, pharmacy benefit management, and a data and analytics branch.", "Market evolution and changing decision-maker influence is leading to new payment and delivery frameworks that focus on value.", "While significant variability continues to exist between providers, an increasing percentage of system encounters are now tied to quality or value – as opposed to volume – through alternative payment models, and commercial payers have increasingly opted to follow the government’s lead in value-based payment models; in fact, in a survey conducted by the Health Care Payment Learning & Action Network, 90% of payers indicated that they believed value-focused payment activity would continue to increase in the future.", "As a result, while payment options will continue to include fee-for-service models in some cases, payers are increasingly shifting toward bundled or episode-based models, payment-by-condition models, and ultimately population health payment models.", "In this way, governments and commercial payers are forcing providers to take on more risk and work as partners beyond singular treatment episodes.", "Such continued payment model reform is also driving the rise of value-based contracting (VBC) in the healthcare space; as providers agree to share more risk with payers, vendors such as pharmaceutical and medical device companies will face increasing pressure to share risk with providers.", "The main three reasons that are supporting the uptake of VBC are as follows:", "1) Companies are increasingly looking for ways to engage effectively with non-clinical stakeholders; these stakeholders care about a different set of parameters than the historical customer, which was the physician, and are constantly looking for agreements around cost and outcomes.", "2) Risk distribution is gradually changing to include manufacturers, which are increasingly sharing risk with hospitals and health systems.", "This allows manufacturers to place specific guarantees surrounding the outcomes that their devices provide, and bolsters accountability for various nontraditional stakeholders, thereby improving quality of care.", "3) The healthcare ecosystem is increasingly focused on cost management, presenting an incentive for various players to align their efforts in order to provide high-quality care at the lowest possible cost.", "The definition of a “customer” has and will continue to evolve to incorporate the roles of multiple stakeholders; physicians – which are the traditional medtech key customers – will retain influence, but will gradually cede control to administrative stakeholders.", "In addition, multi-stakeholder committees, increasingly from more centralized positions within larger hospital systems or networks, have become mainly responsible for authorizing brand selection decisions.", "Because hospitals typically operate at very low margins, non-clinical stakeholders have helped control costs to a greater extent that when physicians represented the main customers by limiting the number of available brands, increasing purchasing power, and bolstering focus on product rationalization and outcomes-based pricing.", "Macrotrend 4: Technology-Enabled Care and Stakeholder Engagement", "Technology-enabled care and stakeholder engagement is creating new possibilities for healthcare delivery and changing the way various stakeholders interact and receive information;

If pre-diabetics are included, the market size more than triples.", "Based in Loughborough, England and founded in 2013, Nemaura Medical (NASDAQ: NMRD) is set to launch SugarBEAT® in the EU following the company’s recent CE Mark approval.", "“Importantly, as a daily disposable adhesive skin-patch that sits on the surface of the skin, SugarBEAT® is painless, and versatile in terms of wear time.", "Given these benefits, we look forward to aggressively entering both the multi-billion-dollar diabetic (insulin and non-insulin dependent) and pre-diabetic markets.", "In addition, we plan to target the wearable health tech market for health-conscious consumers, which is experiencing explosive growth.", "Due to the non-invasive nature of the sensor patch and connection to a rechargeable transmitter, SugarBEAT® will allow users the freedom to decide when, and for how long to wear the patch.", "Moreover, we have a unique competitive advantage, which we believe will make SugarBEAT® the lowest priced CGM device in the industry.", "SugarBEAT® is protected by a solid IP portfolio with over 30 issued and pending patents across multiple patent families, said Dr. Faz Chowdhury, CEO.", "Nemaura is also pursuing FDA approval and anticipate filing a De-Novo 510(k) submission in the coming weeks.", "The FDA submission will be based on Clinical Studies which have already been successfully completed and which were split between Type I and Type II diabetics.", "The study results indicated a MARD (Mean Absolute Relative Difference) of 11.92% (with a lower figure denoting greater accuracy), using a single point finger stick calibration.", "In preparation for an initial commercial launch of SugarBEAT in the United Kingdom in Q3 2019, Nemaura has ordered 12,500 transmitters and is also expected to strengthen its management team and advisory board.", "Nemaura is also scheduled to hold a symposium at a leading global diabetes conference, the European Association for the Study of Diabetes (EASD) in Barcelona in September 2019, where leading Key Opinion Leaders will present observational studies on SugarBEAT.", "Nemaura’s SugarBEAT® consists of a daily disposable adhesive skin-patch connected to a rechargeable transmitter, with an app displaying glucose readings every five minutes for periods up to 24 hours.", "SugarBEAT® is expected to help person with diabetes and pre-diabetics better track how lifestyle factors can impact daily glucose level trends (known as an Ambulatory Glucose Profile) thereby significantly improving the amount of daily time spent in range.", "This behavioral change in turn should help delay or even prevent long term health damage typically caused by diabetes.", "Passing a mild, non-perceptible electric current across the skin, sugarBEAT® painlessly draws a small amount of glucose molecules out of the interstitial fluid which naturally sits just below the top layer of skin, into a chamber within the patch.", "The rechargeable transmitter then measures the glucose levels present within the chamber, and securely transmits this clinically relevant data every five minutes via Bluetooth to a pre-downloaded smart phone / device app.", "Using a proprietary algorithm, the app then converts this data into glucose values. In order to better understand how glucose levels are affected by lifestyle factors, diet / medication / exercise / mood data can also be inputted into the app.", "Traditional way of glucose monitoring vs the the non-invasive sugarBEAT® device", "Comparable continuous glucose monitoring devices from Abbott, Dexcom, and Senseonics average 2-3x the daily cost, involve invasive needles or implants, and have extended wear requirements of between 10 to 90 days.", "Moreover, whilst both Dexcom and Abbott have blazed a path toward wider acceptance and strong patient adoption of CGM technology amongst insulin users, they have practically zero penetration in the much larger non-insulin using diabetic and pre-diabetic markets.", "The real benefit comes from the fact that they have disrupted the market enough to allow for additional competitors, like Nemaura, that can better fill the voids initially opened by both Dexcom and Abbott.", "Nemaura’s SugarBEAT® has a wear time of up to 24 hours, allowing for greater flexibility, with users able to wear on a non-consecutive day basis, unlike other glucose monitors.", "SugarBEAT’s® easy monitoring provides a visible indicator of fluctuations in glucose levels, helping patients better understand the factors that affect these levels, while reducing diabetic complications and improving quality of life.", "Although it already has multiple advantages over similar technologies, Nemaura continues to seek ways to improve the technology.", "Earlier this year, the company announced that it reduced the skin-patch warm-up period of SugarBEAT® from over an hour to a period of less than 30 minutes.", "This is important as faster application is expected to result in increased device adoption.", "In April, Nemaura announced the addition of new predictive alert functionality to SugarBEAT®.", "Alerts have been designed to provide visual indication when glucose levels are falling or rising above minimum and maximum thresholds.", "Audible and vibration alerts are also available through Bluetooth-connected mobile phones.", "In May, the company announced it will allow third-party applications, such as diabetes management, exercise and nutrition focused apps royalty free access to SugarBEAT® CGM app data.", "As a result, users will be able to directly access SugarBEAT® generated glucose data through their preferred participating mobile aplications, empowering users with greater choice over when to use this data to better understand how food choices and other lifestyle factors impact glucose levels.", "This development is part of the company’s broader go-to-market strategy, which is being led by Dr. Fred Schaebsdau.", "Dr. Schaebsdau joined the Company earlier this year to advance the commercialization and business development of SugarBEAT®, building on his success with earlier CGM products at Abbott Diabetes Care and Dexcom Germany.", "Dr. Schaebsdau commented, “We believe integrating SugarBEAT® data into the leading health and fitness apps will help to expand our target market among health-conscious consumers, providing them with seamless access to their CGM data within a familiar environment, which will assist in understanding how diet, sleep, stress, exercise and other lifestyle factors can impact glucose levels.", "Given SugarBEAT® is non-invasive, we believe it is uniquely placed amongst CGMs to appeal to the health-conscious consumer market.”", "Further enhancements to the SugarBEAT® platform are likely as user feedback pours in post-launch.", "SugarBEAT® is based on a platform technology that can be adapted to a broad range of diagnostics beyond glucose monitoring.", "Current development projects underway include products for wellness and pre-diabetics, including pediatric coverage.", "Longer-term, development plans include monitoring/diagnostic solutions for Phenylketonuria, inflammation, anaerobic metabolism, drug treatment regimen optimization, and lactate monitoring (ideal for performance training).", "In preparation for its impending launch in the UK and beyond, Nemaura has secured multiple key distribution relationships.", "Throughout the UK and Ireland, Nemaura has enlisted the help of Dallas Burston Ethitronix (DBE).", "DBE was founded by Dr. Dallas Burston, a pharma marketing entrepreneur with a strong track record of selling breakthrough medical products into European markets.", "Dr. Burston has generated $200M+ selling medical companies he founded to big pharma players.", "SugarBEAT® was also licensed to Dubai-based TPM for sales in the Middle East, a region with an estimated 35 million diabetics, and a leading device distributor has signed on for sales in Australia and New Zealand.", "After hitting the market this quarter, Nemaura believes that it can substantially grow the CGM market which typically targets insulin using patients, where Dexcom is projected by end of 2018 to have sales of circa $950 million across 300,000 device users and Abbott is projecting sales of circa $1+ billion with 950,000 users estimated by end of 2018 alone.", "Given there are more than 400 million persons with diabetes globally, of which an estimated 25% or 100 million require insulin, the opportunity for market growth of CGM is very large.", "Not only is Nemaura capable of winning substantial market share in the $82 billion global CGM market, SugarBEAT® can also bring glucose trending to the 300 million non-insulin using persons with diabetes and more than one billion pre-diabetic market that is currently grossly underserved.", "And for investors, that is where a substantial portion of the value opportunity lies.", "Combining the sum of the parts, investors should pay close attention to Nemaura as it continues to develop innovative opportunities that may quickly seize a significant portion of the global glucose and lactate monitoring markets.", "From an investment standpoint, Nemaura’s stock, at these levels, may offer a sizable opportunity for investment growth based on untapped, near-term, and emerging potential."]}

I wish I could have entered the world of CGM use much sooner. Just in the first 3 weeks, I’m seeing far better glucose control.”", "In Pennsylvania, T1D Sarah Kangas tells DiabetesMine that she can afford CGM with her employer insurance, and would give up pretty much anything else to keep her CGM if necessary.", "“I gave up cable to make sure I had the funds available. Take away my washing machine, computer, microwave or dishwasher but leave my Dexcom G6!”", "She’s used the Dexcom G6 for 12 years now. The technology allows her to work and drive safely.

But Medicaid still only covers CGM for people requiring insulin, taking at least 3 injections per day, or using insulin pump therapy.", "Blanchette, who also lives with T1D, says she faces CGM affordability struggles herself too. That helps inform how she talks with people about this technology.", "“I struggled to pay for very costly CGMs over the past few years. I maxed out my flex spending and found other ways to pay for the high cost, like charging my credit card until I could pay,” she says.", "“CGM is trying to move towards the pharmacy model, which will save people a lot on monthly payments. For people with high costs through durable medical equipment (DME) suppliers, I encourage them to look into changing over to the pharmacy.", "This is successful and much cheaper in some cases but definitely not in all situations.”", "In the state of Washington, another DCES Alison Evert works in primary care, and only sees a few PWDs throughout their 17 primary care clinics.", "But she’s quite familiar with CGM. She worked for years with the esteemed diabetes tech researcher Dr. Irl Hirsch from the University of Washington Medicine, who lives with T1D himself.", "When Evert talks with her patients, she says it’s important to balance expectations of what CGM tech can offer with how realistic it is for that person to use and access it.", "Most of her patients use the Abbott Libre because it’s less expensive and offers a simpler version of continuous glucose monitoring compared to the Dexcom G6.", "Often, some healthcare professionals aren’t as familiar with CGM technology. They’re less able to explain to their patients what exactly a system offers.", "This can lead to unrealistic expectations, especially if they don’t share details up front on pricing or the nuances of obtaining insurance coverage.", "Evert’s clinic is just starting a pilot program to raise more awareness about CGM technology. That’s particularly important as companies like Dexcom and Abbott release more direct-to-consumer marketing and TV commercials promoting their tech, which leads more people to ask about it, she says.", "“There’s a steep learning curve, and we struggle with assisting healthcare professionals to talk with their patients about CGM,” Evert says.", "“A lot of people decide they want to have it, regardless of talking about the cost and whether it’s covered.", "“It starts with setting realistic expectations,” she says. “We want healthcare professionals to have the education to talk about this and set realistic expectations up front.", "This is better than having someone be all excited about CGM and then later be super-frustrated that they hadn’t heard it’s not and they can’t afford it out-of-pocket.”", "Part of their initiative is creating bullet point messaging and one-page FAQs that both patients and healthcare professionals can use to address these key concerns during an appointment.", "The info includes cost and insurance coverage basics to help if a patient wants to push forward to get on a CGM.", "“What we find in primary care, is that often we build a foundation for the healthcare professionals to know about and engage with CGM,” she says.", "“People are so excited about this technology, and we want it to be accessible to them as much as possible.”", "Thankfully, each of the CGM device companies offer some official assistance to qualifying customers.", "- Medtronic’s CGM Discount Access Program can lower costs to as little as $75 per month for people meeting certain criteria.", "- Dexcom offers a Patient Assistance Program to current U.S. customers who lost their health insurance coverage as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.", "You’ll need to submit an application to determine eligibility.

Both Abbott Libre and Dexcom G6 supplies are available in pharmacies. This can help you avoid a higher deductible through traditional “DME” coverage.", "But some insurance plans don’t allow for pharmacy coverage with CGM. It may also require an appeal or doctor-initiated push to convince a plan to allow this.", "Consider a loaner “Professional CGM.” Rather than buying your own personal CGM to use at home, some clinics offer a “professional” CGM that you can wear for short periods of time to get a snapshot of your glucose data and diabetes management.", "These loaner units may be “blinded,” so that only the doctor can initially see the data to review with you afterward.", "People generally do not receive charges for these beyond the cost of their doctor’s visits.", "Seek out samples. While it’s less common, some doctor’s offices and clinics have a stock of extra supplies they keep on hand that they may be willing to share with you.", "This won’t provide a reliable or steady flow of CGM supplies, but it might be something to consider for a start.", "Appeal to the patient community. People in the community do a lot to help each other out, from sharing surplus supplies to grassroots fundraising.", "One effort known as Mutual Aid Diabetes (MAD) frequently uses social media to amplify calls for assistance and steer people to aid programs.", "Also, some nonprofit organizations offer grants to families in need, such as Will’s Way, created by an Indiana D-Mom and her son Will with T1D. Kyler Cares out of New York also helps families in need to afford insulin pumps and CGM supplies.", "Try restarting sensors. While it’s not an FDA-approved tactic, many CGM users turn to the DIY tactic of hacking their devices to prolong their lifecycles, thereby saving money.", "It’s not as simple as pushing a button, but some DIYers have discovered how they can restart Dexcom G6 sensors to use beyond 10 days and transmitters past the 90-day mark.", "DIYers also found that they can extend the life of Abbott Libre sensors. This comes with a cautionary warning of “do it at your own risk,” but it’s a common search and discussion topic in online forums when discussing the costs of CGM use."]}

Jeremy Howard is a good amount of the reason I now work at Google, on NLP and deep learning of all things!", "Love the learning philosophy here, which many smart people don’t embrace (I’ve met a large number of PhD people who recommend linear algebra, or something equally idiotic when asked by a beginner how to get into deep learning) and would benefit from greatly: “learning the whole game”.", "In other words, don’t procrastinate with pre-reqs, dive in to the hard stuff first, then use that to self educate on which pre reqs are even needed for the depth.", "Lot of respect to Jeremy for making this free and his recent work on covid", "This book is how I would recommend people get into deep learning.

I love how hands on it is, and straight to the point. The book is created with Jupyter notebooks which is both an advantage and a disadvantage.", "The title says \"for coders\" and then the book goes to explain things such as a GPU or C language as if you are a 5 years-old.", "I feel like this books is written for those who haven't coded in their lives actually. It's a good book for entering the field for sure.", "A side note: As much as Jeremy Howard loves Jupyter Notebook (which is a good tool for experimenting data science stuff), I feel pushing a little bit too hard for Notebooks, the book apparently is written in Notebooks and the quality not even comparable with LaTeX.", "My point is that as good as notebook can be, it's just a tool, and it has its own limitations, and trying to present it as an ultimate tool is a bit dishonest."]}

Sixty-six were polymorphic as a result of 88 alternative allelic states [biallelic polymorphisms (BiPs)], for a frequency of approximately one BiP per kilobase.", "Five of the 88 BiPs probably represent three independent recombination events: Four seem to reflect two similar imports spanning 24 to 25 kb from S. enterica serovar Typhimurium (fig. S1), and a gene fragment with six single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) is identical to the corresponding gene fragment in S. enterica serovar Paratyphi A.", "The other 83 BiPs consisted of 37 nonsynonymous SNPs, 3 of which resulted in premature stop codons; 33 synonymous SNPs; 12 SNPs in pseudogenes; and one deletion of 4 base pairs.", "We anticipated that housekeeping genes would exhibit diminished levels of nucleotide diversity, π, as a result of purifying selection, and that pathogenicity genes would exhibit elevated levels as a result of diversifying selection.", "However, π did not differ significantly with gene category (P > 0.05, analysis of variance) (table S1).", "Purifying selection should result in Ka/Ks (the ratio of nonsynonymous substitutions per nonsynonymous site to synonymous substitutions per synonymous site) values that are less than 1.0 and diversifying selection should result in ratios higher than 1.0.", "A trend in this direction was observed (table S1), but it was not particularly strong. We therefore concluded that these 88 BiPs largely reflect the lack of strong selection and are markers of neutral population structure in Typhi.", "It was somewhat surprising that a supposedly obligate pathogen such as Typhi should possess a neutral population structure, but the population structure of several other bacterial species that occasionally cause disease can also be explained by neutral genetic drift (13).", "The distribution pattern of the 88 BiPs within Typhi is highly unusual because it is fully parsimonious according to maximum parsimony analysis (homoplasy index = 0).", "The 88 BiPs defined 59 haplotypes that form a unique path within a single minimal spanning tree of length 88, except for three hypothetical nodes (Fig. 1).", "These observations suggest that each BiP was caused by a unique genetic event, either a single mutation (83 BiPs) or the three imports described above (5 BiPs).", "The tree contains 19 informative BiPs that mark the evolutionary history of Typhi plus 69 noninformative BiPs that are specific to single haplotypes.", "A second, highly unusual feature of this data set is that the ancestral node, haplotype H45, is represented by extant bacteria.", "H45 must be the ancestral “root” node, because it possesses the identical nucleotides for all 82 SNPs, as did eight genomes of S. enterica of other serovars, whereas all other haplotypes result from one or more mutations.", "The general appearance of the tree (Fig. 1) suggests descent from H45 in multiple lineages, followed by diversification during multiple, independent population expansions that resulted in radial clusters of haplotypes containing the noninformative BiPs.", "For example, one cluster contains all seven Indonesian isolates with the z66 flagellar variant. The z66 cluster radiates from a single haplotype, indicating that it has arisen only once.", "Hence, z66 isolates cannot represent the evolutionary source of Typhi (11), because the z66 cluster is distant from H45.", "The haplotype tree has a third, highly unusual feature: Most links between sequential haplotypes consist of single SNPs, and many longer edges, including one hypothetical node, were resolved into steps of single SNPs when additional strains were surveyed (fig.", "S2). Even within this initial sample of 105 isolates, almost half of the mutational steps during the evolutionary history of Typhi are represented by extant haplotypes, indicating long persistence of individual haplotypes.", "If ecotypes associated with periodic selection were to exist within Typhi, the genetic continuum between haplotypes implies that ecotypes are subdivisions of haplotypes.", "Furthermore, haplotypes and haplotype clusters were found in multiple continents. For example, it is unclear where H45 evolved, because it has been isolated from five locations in Asia, Africa, and North America (3).", "Because each BiP is associated with a single, genetic event, each haplotype or haplotype cluster that is present in multiple continents marks at least one independent wave of global transmission.", "Global transmission has not been previously described for Typhi but is a well-known phenomenon with other human pathogens.", "To place the time scale associated with neutral evolution in context, we calculated the time since the most recent common ancestor (tmrca) and the effective population size (Ne) from the selectively neutral data in Fig.", "1. These calculations were performed with the use of two estimates of the molecular clock rate, a high rate corresponding to the long-term rate of accumulation of synonymous mutations between Escherichia coli and S. enterica (5) and a clock rate one-fifth as high, corresponding to the rate of accumulation of all mutations in conserved housekeeping genes between these species (14).", "For Typhi, tmrca is 10 to 43 thousand years (95% confidence limits of 5.7 to 15.8 thousand years for the high clock rate and 25.5 to 71 thousand years for the low rate) according to both Bayesian skyline plots (15) and maximum likelihood trees (fig.", "S3). Based on the same clock rates, Ne is currently 2.3 × 105 to 1.0 × 106 (confidence limits of 1.2 × 104 to 9.3 × 105 for the high clock rate and 5.3 × 104 to 4.1 × 106 for the low clock rate) (fig.", "S3A). Similar values were obtained from the nucleotide variation, θw, by an independent method (16) (table S1).", "The maximum likelihood tree also suggests that H45, the ancestral haplotype, and multiple descendent haplotypes arose after human migrations out of Africa but before the Neolithic period (fig.", "The existence of an asymptomatic human carrier state for typhoid is formally similar to tuberculosis, for which the reactivation of granulomas after decades results in delays of centuries between initial new infections and subsequent epidemic peaks (17).", "Likewise, we propose that the human carrier state allowed persistence of infection with Typhi during periods of isolation and was essential for transmission between hunter-gatherer groups.", "Hence, the population structure and geographical distribution of Typhi may largely reflect the frequency of carriers.", "The 55 polymorphic coding gene fragments (excluding pseudogenes) were screened by mutation discovery with 59 additional strains that were isolated between 1958 and 1967 from Africa and Vietnam.", "All but three strains were assigned to known haplotypes from the global sample (fig. S4). Twelve haplotypes were isolated on multiple occasions over a range of 22 to 44 years from eight countries (Table 1), demonstrating that Typhi haplotypes persist in single countries for decades, or longer.", "For example, CT18 (9) is a multidrug-resistant (MDR) strain of haplotype H1 that was isolated in Vietnam in 1993, soon after multidrug resistance emerged.", "However, a Vietnamese isolate from 1967 was also of haplotype H1, showing that H1 was present in Vietnam long before multidrug resistance emerged.", "The long-term persistence of Typhi may also reflect the carrier state and can help explain why Typhi remains endemic in regions of the world with poor drinking-water quality and limited sewage treatment (18).", "| Haplotype | Persistence (years) | Years persisted | No. of isolates |", "Antibiotic-resistant typhoid fever has recently become an enormous public health problem in southern Asia because of the emergence of MDR Typhi followed by nalidixic acid resistance (NalR) with concomitant reduced susceptibility to fluoroquinolones (19).", "Fluoroquinolones were first used for antibiotic therapy in southeast Asia in 1989 (20) and NalR Typhi were reported in 1991 (21).", "Such strong selection should have led to a population expansion of NalR Typhi, and possibly to clonal replacement of existing haplotypes within southern Asia.", "We therefore performed mutation discovery with the 55 polymorphic coding fragments on 295 additional strains of Typhi that were isolated from southern Asia between 1986 and 2004.", "Again, most strains were assigned to known haplotypes and only a few defined new, peripheral haplotypes (Fig.", "2B). However, the relative frequencies of isolates differed from those in the global set of 105 strains (Fig. 1), because most recent isolates from southern Asia, particularly NalR isolates, belonged to haplotype H58 (Fig.", "2B). Thus, a recent population expansion of H58 seems to have resulted from the general use of fluoroquinolones.", "We also investigated the genetic diversity of a 489-base pair fragment of the gyrA gene encoding a DNA gyrase subunit, within which nonsynonymous mutations at codons 83 and 87 result in resistance to nalidixic acid (22).", "All 125 strains that were sensitive to nalidixic acid (Nal5) and all other strains with unknown resistance to nalidixic acid possessed the ancestral gyrA+ sequence.", "In contrast, all 119 NalR strains, most of which were isolated in south central or southeast Asia (table S2), possessed one of six nonsynonymous mutations at codons 83 and 87 of gyrA (Fig.", "2A), and no other mutations were detected in gyrA (or parC). We identified 15 independent mutational events (A through O in Fig.", "2B) in distinct haplotypes that also possessed gyrA+ alleles. Assuming that they all arose between 1991 and 2004 (13 years), the identification of ≥15 mutations in two codons (6 base pairs) yields a minimum frequency of 0.19 per base pair per year, ≥2.5 × 108 greater than the longterm mutation clock rate within E. coli (14).", "For most haplotypes with gyrA mutations, NalR strains were detected only once or twice; however, NalR variants of haplotype H58 and its derivative haplotypes (H34, H57, and H60 to H65) were isolated in Vietnam, India, and Pakistan, and other countries in southern Asia (Table 2).", "These NalR variants represent at least five distinct gyrA mutations (K, L, M, N, and O), which arose during or before the mid-1990s (Fig.", "2C). The frequency of gyrA+ and mutation L has remained fairly constant since the mid-1990s, but H58 isolates with mutation K seem to have become more common in recent years, particularly in Vietnam (Table 2).", "| Haplotype | gyrA mutation (isolates) | gyrA+ (isolates) |", "| H1 | G: Vietnam | Vietnam (23); Laos (7); Bangladesh; |", "| H58 | K: Vietnam (68), Pakistan (5), India (4), Cambodia, Nepal, central Africa; | Vietnam (31), India (12), Laos (5), Pakistan (3), Hong Kong (2), Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, Morocco |", "| L: India (6), Bangladesh (6), Vietnam (5), Indonesia | ||", "| H34, H57, and H60-65 | K: Vietnam (8), Bangladesh (2) | Nepal, Laos |", "These results show that selection for antibiotic resistance has probably led to clonal expansion of H58 and its NalR derivatives in southern Asia.", "These strains have now also reached Africa, given that one MDR H58 strain (isolated in Morocco in 2003) was included among nine rare, recent MDR isolates from Africa and that the sole MDR NalR isolate from Africa that was tested (mutation K, isolated in central Africa in 2004) also belonged to H58 (Table 2).", "Thus, H58 is probably not ethnically restricted to southern Asians, and nalidixic acid-resistant typhoid fever may soon present an additional public health problem in Africa.", "Despite the selection for resistance to nalidixic acid in southern Asia, the data do not show complete clonal replacement, which would be expected from periodic selection; about 20% of Typhi isolated in recent years in northern Vietnam and 5% of Typhi from southern Vietnam remain susceptible to nalidixic acid, as are many other recent H58 isolates (Fig.", "2C). Furthermore, recent isolates from southern Asia also belong to other haplotypes, where mutations in gyrA are rare (Fig.", "2B). Thus, the population structure indicative of neutral evolution has not been disrupted by strong selection for resistance to nalidixic acid during the past 15 years, except for the clonal expansion of H58.", "Possibly gyrA mutations in many haplotypes reduce fitness (23) or some cases of typhoid fever have not been treated with fluoroquinolones.", "But still another alternative is that the population structure of Typhi reflects two distinct epidemiological dynamics associated with different time scales: first, the human carrier state permitting slow neutral evolution (millennia), and second, infectious transmission facilitating a rapid response to selection in real time.", "Outbreaks of infections, similar to the recent expansion of H58 in southeast Asia, may be responsible for independent chains of intercontinental transmission.", "These, in turn, create a global distribution of carriers for multiple haplotypes. According to this interpretation, it is exactly because the environment selects that everything is everywhere in Typhi, thus inverting a hotly disputed (24) tenet of microbial ecology that was proposed by L. G. M. Baas Becking in 1934 (25).", "The results presented here open multiple avenues for future research. Long-term epidemiology with larger strain collections is now possible on the basis of neutral SNPs (fig.", "S2), whereas classical microbiological methods do not seem to provide reliable markers for such purposes (table S3).", "Surveillance of haplotypes is particularly appropriate to provide early warning of the continued spread of NalR H58.", "Our overview of the current global population diversity in Typhi will allow comparisons of genomic sequences from representative strains without the risk of phylogenetic discovery bias (26).", "Finally, we suggest that the human carrier state may be of much greater importance for neutral evolution and genetic buffering than had been previously appreciated, an interpretation that would demand major changes in public health campaigns to reduce the incidence of typhoid.", "We thank M.

A strategy and design consultancy that helps a company is it sees the reality and potential of their businesses products and brands.", "Frank Cooper is the global chief marketing officer of BlackRock as global CMO.", "Jeremy Goldman: He is responsible for shaping BlackRock’s global brand marketing strategy for institutions and retail clients.", "The two of them teamed up for one of the most compelling panels at Collision 2019 discussing the future of brand purpose.", "By the way, this conversation was recorded right outside the conference center in Toronto. So you’re definitely going to hear a little bit of background noise here and there when we weren’t able to get good audio on account of the wind.", "We did have to make a few edits but hopefully those won’t be too distracting. Also, we started recording after we had already begun a great discussion about whether or not words like corporate social responsibility and design thinking and brand purpose are being appropriated.", "So you’ll be entering the conversation about one minute in. So let’s jump right in. Sorry. You were saying?", "Frank Cooper: No, I was wondering whether you think they take the well, no, by by misappropriating those words and exploiting them in ways that", "Alain Sylvain: Actually confused me because they’re not living out what they’re, what they’re talking to them.", "I think so. I mean design and one of these concepts, it’s been confused because business that seized upon it because Stanford and ITU, they create design thinking all these things happen.", "And like what, what is design? No one really knows what design is. I think purpose is in danger of that same sort of thing.", "Yeah. You know, and frank talks a lot about this, it’s corporate purposes, brand purposes, a lot of different ways you can conceive it, but ultimately there should be a shared definition around what we mean by super.", "Yeah. I mean otherwise this, I mean is in a weird way, it’s kind of like the idea of artificial intelligence now where everybody tries to the term", "Jeremy Goldman: And say, oh my, you know, stock will rise as a startup by just saying, oh, we’ve got some AI trust us to.", "But, but if you define it, have you put some parameters around doing good or CSR or you know, ethical behavior and it, what it is and what it is.", "And then you, you don’t have other people encroaching on the term without actually doing it. Right?", "Frank Cooper: Yeah. Yeah. We look at me. So notion though that this is something totally new and out of the blue and never existed before.", "I think it’s not correct. I think it’s not a trend. I think it’s, it’s, it’s reclaiming what’s always been there.", "I mean, people go back to all the way back to Adam Smith and everyone talks about the wealth of nations, right?", "But he wrote theory of moral sentiments before that. And that was much more about ethics and virtue and relationships and how that plays culture.", "Really. How that plays into economics. To me, this exploitation issue is true and some companies are going to use it as a cloak and said like, hey, look at me on purpose driven in some way use it as a shield to try to defend against attacks.", "But there’s still an underlying truth to it all. And that truth is that I think more and more people want to have a sense that it has, employees are contributing to something larger and it doesn’t have to be so, so spectacularly large that it’s about, I’m going to solve water scarcity in the world.", "Frank Cooper: It can be as simple as I’m giving you more time back to the means, you know or it could be that I’m providing a sense of community or I’m actually giving you a sense of both individual and collective identity.", "You’ve been historically marginalized. I’m pulling you to the center stage. There’s a bunch of ways to come at it.", "But the most important pieces is that it’s not purely CSR, it’s your commercial operations are tied to that as an ultimate goal in profits.", "Just happens to be one of the outcomes of it. That to me is the, that’s the opportunity that kind of, that lies before us.", "Jeremy Goldman: You know, the, I guess the challenge obviously with it is that I think that most companies you can’t just do good without figuring out like, how do I do good, but at the same time generate the profits as expected for my shareholders or for my, you know, employers or investors, whatever.", "So how does you know, company balance those two things by saying you know, it or is it just a matter of saying it?", "Trusting that by doing good the other things will follow. Right?", "Alain Sylvain: Yeah, yeah, yeah. I mean I, I think you know, what frank ended on I think is really key as a prophet.", "That’s one of the metrics at the end of the day. And when you brought him in, let me broaden it to include purpose.", "You know, are you committing to your purpose as an output? I think inevitably you’re thinking more than you’re thinking about more than shareholder doubt or you’re thinking about community.", "Think my employees think customers, suppliers, vendors, you know, what we talked about on stage but I talked about on stage was Ben and Jerry has this thing that they, that they talk about called linear prosperity of your, this thing is pretty cool.", "It’s basically they’re committing to the idea that as the company does well, all their employees and customers, all that will do well.", "And I think that that perspective is a new way of thinking about business. You’re not thinking about shareholder value, you’re not thinking about short term.", "You’re thinking about the collective and as the company grows, so too will the community beyond it. And I think that’s the throwback to the inception of what the role of companies were meant to be as organizations and institutions that were communal.", "So sure. You know, the idea of shareholder value I think is relevant as just one part of what the expectations should be I think for the company.", "Frank Cooper: Yeah. And I think this whole bifurcation doing well by doing good should go away. You know, I think, I think now it should be just merge it together and it’s just doing well inherently is defined as you’re serving some human need.", "Just merge it together because the separation of the two in a way create some kind of strange thing. The doing well piece.", "It’s like make your profits and serve the world. I’d say flip it, serve people and in serving people you figure out how you actually sustain the company and sometimes that might not mean maximizing profit at every single term.", "You know when cvs said I’m going to pull the cigarettes off the shelf. They weren’t maximizing profits in the short term, but they pivoted toward this idea that we’re a healthcare company in long term that it actually will benefit us.", "It also virtual event. But but, but the point was they had a sense of like, here’s why we exist in the world and that’s going to be our ultimate goal and we’re going to keep that front and center about, about our strategy.", "We’ve got our decisions, it’ll be the north star for our employees. And I think that’s just, I don’t know if we can call it doing well by doing good.", "I think it’s just doing what you do to serve people.", "Alain Sylvain: Yeah, I mean the concepts, again, businesses seized upon this in so many different ways.", "That’s great. Thank you so much. Thank you. Thanks. You got that on audio right? You heard it here first.", "I’ll send you guys that. Yeah, like you did hear it enough times today, but yeah, business is kind of theirs.", "Theirs doing well by doing good. Doing good. Which is a trope that you hear a lot about, which is about, you’re right at trivializes good doing good part CSR.", "It’s a whole other way to think about it. In the corporate sector, it’s completely different. Like you said, you mentioned you’re writing a piece about CSR, partly not CSR.", "That’s completely different than the way you’re defining purpose. And you know, CSR is almost like a, it’s almost like big companies showing contrition because of their impact on the world.", "You know, and it’s, and I’ve worked for some of these groups in big companies and it’s pathetic CSR but budgets fit relative to big, big.", "Alain Sylvain: It’s to say we did something and not necessarily to orient the company around that. Exactly.", "It’s really troublesome. I and I worked with a big beverage company one time and they, and they had, you know, their, their imprint cause their environmental and Pronto was horrific and they, but they created a little, like a little girl and they would distribute water at crises or something that was CSR.", "And I was like, wash their hands and they’re independent immigrant. So, so, so I think what we’re talking about three definitions of how approves corporate purposes, right?", "There’s the, there’s the CSR piece, which to me is about contrition. There’s the do well by doing good piece, which is about compromise, two different motivations at the same time.", "And then there’s this thing that Frank’s talking about, which I think is do well as, as a key priority and everything else will fall into place including profits.", "Jeremy Goldman: Yeah, no, you’re right. Different strains of [inaudible]. And I think part of the reason why it’s been almost like these different, these different parallel discussions is because different people can be won over by different arguments, you know?", "So there’s some people where you say doing well by doing good, because that’s the only way you can get them on board.", "And then there are some company people who do believe, you know what, we need to achieve a 30% profit, but we don’t need 32 so maybe let’s figure out what we can do with that", "so we don’t get above our levels and actually act as a good citizen.", "Frank Cooper: Yeah, yeah. Don’t think it’s right. I mean, those, you’re exactly right. What I hope though is that more leaders, purpose driven leaders ask themselves one question is, how do we serve people in this world in what we do?", "Like if we, if we were extraordinarily successful and we achieved every single goal that we put out, [inaudible] what is the outcome of that on the world?", "And, and we start to ask that question, then you start to reframe your ultimate goal. Your ultimate goal is much bigger than on profits, as much bigger than, than CSR as much bigger than doing well by doing good.", "Now the reality though, and kind of the, the cold water on the face is quarterly earnings pressure, right?", "And, and that’s, that’s a piece I don’t have. We’ve talked about this during our panels today. Don’t have a direct answer for that, except it requires, I think, investors academics consumers all to kind of coalesce and say, we actually value companies that have purpose at the center and we’re gonna vote with our, with our wallets.", "We’re gonna vote by investing differently. We’re gonna vote by buying things differently. It hasn’t happened yet.", "Jeremy Goldman: Yeah. Well, and it’s also, it’s one of those things where it’s very easy I think for most people to say,", "okay we, we have like quarterly earnings coming up. Can we cut one thing to then just this quarter to hit our numbers to make our numbers look a little bit better?", "And then next quarter it’s like, I know we said we would just do it once, but then we do it twice. And it’s kind of like this whole, is there an inherent tension between short term and longterm thinking?", "That short term will always win if that’s how the average person is incentivized. Whereas if you, if someone’s pay is tied towards the longterm performance of the company and not towards the short term, could that be a way of incentivize longterm behavior?", "Frank Cooper: We should take the pressure off of quarterly earnings reports so that people start to think more more long term.", "I hope that happens. But, but this is on both ends of the spectrum. You know, if you look at the soul of a startup early on, even though they stated purpose, they’re really out to survive and they do whatever it takes to survive in the end.", "And they’re like, this is one time we’ll make a change. And same thing on the other end. You know, people who are large corporations, they’re looking to survive and, and and survive quarter by quarter because their, their tenure as a CEO depends on it.", "Somewhere in between there, there’s like this, I won’t call it Nirvana, but there’s almost this moment of, of equilibrium.", "You know, where the actual purpose is lived and believed and and people fully engage in, it just doesn’t last very long because the ecosystem doesn’t support it.", "Alain Sylvain: What’s long term. Yeah, yeah. That’s, that’s really, yeah. I mean, it’s not, this is being purpose driven, sustainable.", "That to me is a real question. Like, can you, can you really commit to it and have it enduring? I’m really encouraged by what’s happening in blackrock.", "I’m not saying that because Frank’s my client likes truthfully high coincidence. Yeah, exactly. No, truthfully, I mean, and I think that’s why he took the job by the way.", "Like it just happened even before he showed up at black rock. What Laurie thinks doing this is pretty profound and I think what we’re getting at is a very different one.", "When a founder driven company, I think it’s easier to do this. So it’s easy for Larry to put out letters, CEOs and saying, think longterm.", "But when you’re a public company and you inherited the job and you’d be incentivized by a quarterly, I think this, this question is, it’s different.", "Frank Cooper: The pressure for, for companies to become pressure more purpose driven. And to extent that it’s coming from ordinary people.", "It’s coming from really what we see as what we’re calling the populace movement, right? It’s people saying, I feel left out of prosperity in this country.", "And, and that doesn’t seem to be unique to any particular region right now. So you go to Germany, you see it, you go to Italy, the five star movement, you see, and you go to Norway, you see it, you go to Sweden, they have it.", "You go to Brazil and ball scenario, you say go to United States. You say you got to Philippines and the turtle, you see it, they’re all saying the same thing, which is I see prosperity around me.", "I’m being left out. And by the way, when I look forward, I’m even more fearful.", "Jeremy Goldman: Well, one thing I was just curious about is the quantification of this, right? Because I think that this is something that, you know, folks like all three of us believe on some level is a very important, and yet though, you know, the way that anything happens is, you know, through data and by showing people who might disagree with your point that they’re incorrect.", "And I mean, just what kind of data is out there to show that this is the wave of the, not to say is the first time ever that we cared about this, but that this is something that’s gonna grow in the future.", "And importance in that lesson. I think, go ahead. I think this the most important unlock for us right now where we’re actually working on it.", "Frank Cooper: It was a lot of data of people showing that performance driven companies outperform those who are not formed.", "A purpose driven companies outperform those who are not over a five year period. If you look at the s and p 500, etc.", "You know, whether that’s rigorous or not, it’s a question of questionable. But what is pretty clear is that we know we have low employee engagement across the board, across every industry.", "Like 80% of people have a police feel kind of unengaged. We know that if you can get employees to feel more engaged at work, their performance will be higher.", "Productivity will be higher. Boomi I suppose to you guys to stay in the question and then, because I’d love to hear both of your hands.", "But our consumer is willing to punish companies that actually don’t live up to their purpose.", "Frank Cooper: You know, and we can, I can think of a few right off the top of my head. They don’t seem to have, have received much punishment for violating their stated purpose.", "So Patagonia goes out, this is hypothetical and you go out and we all know Patagonia is our purpose, you know, to improve the environment.", "Overall they’d go out and they support raising half a of the rainforest, you know in order to produce, you know housing for their, their, the populations that they serve and, and clothes, et cetera.", "And people find out that, wait a minute, this is such a fundamental violation for your, is it okay? No.", "Jeremy Goldman: Well, it was a, it’s, it’s, there’s two things to it. I think one thing is it’s not okay if a company does something that reeks of hypocrisy.", "Then I think that just in general, when you do something that’s off brand, it’s a bigger deal than if you just do something that isn’t good.", "You know, like being off brand tends to really hurt you. But I think the other key thing is it provides an opportunity for somebody else to jump in.", "And for instance, Amazon is not known as being the most socially conscious company in the world. But there isn’t a company out there that, that is a great substitute for Amazon, therefore they can get punished.", "So it creates an opening for somebody else when you stumble. But it doesn’t mean that people are willing to, if they don’t have somewhere else to go.", "Jeremy Goldman: So what that says is, you know, you have to find somewhere else to go. And if there isn’t anywhere, then you know, we all kind of look the other way and pretend that Uber wasn’t for Lyft, the delete Uber Movement.", "I literally, since I sold my agency and I’ve been doing journalism for a while, but since I sold my agency had a little bit extra time.", "So I started doing some, a stand up comedy type of stuff. And I said I, you know, I was going to take a Lyft here, but I figured, you know, I’d take a Uber cause I hate women, you know, and there’s like an element to that where it’s like we all kind of agreed or a lot of people agreed, you know what, we’re not happy with the Uber’s practices, so we’ll look the other way because it was in some places just like the best place to, the best thing to get around.", "Frank Cooper: I know. That’s what I’m concerned about because people like they point to Travis and all and all the activity in the culture of the company and say it’s horrific things like so damn convenient and, and, and, and you felt like, even though we have to delete Uber moving Lyft never really stepped into the void enough where you felt like, you know, I can get the same cars and service as Uber and so", "Jeremy Goldman: Just as we were. Yeah. So when you, when you become that ubiquitous, you know, then that’s the, I mean, and I’ll still try to take videos around cause it’s actually is really good mapping technology, but, but I think that ultimately, I mean not to be political, but to just to say if somebody else was describing this to me, it’s like a lot of people made they wouldn’t agree necessarily with most things about Trump, but they voted for him because they knew that he was going to do this, this and this, and that mattered enough to them that they were willing to look the other way about the individual that they were voting for.", "Alain Sylvain: I mean this is a, and by the way, getting political, you’re in a safe space. Like we would, I would,", "I’d love talking about this sort of thing. Yeah. A big question I have is how much how complicit are we as consumers?", "You know, you know, you mentioned Amazon and Uber and I took an Uber here. How complicit am I in these companies violating their, their purpose or, or whatever.", "And I think about this a lot. You know, Instagram is a great by far. I’m like connect with people on it.", "It’s a great way to see what’s going on. But I also am deeply concerned and troubled about Facebook and their, and what they’re doing.", "You know, we’re in privacy and yet they’re trying to connect the world, but at what costs and, but every time I open up that app, I am furthering their costs.", "And I think there’s a big question around how much, how responsible are we as, as you know, we were talking about voting with your dollar before and all of that, but it’s also voting with your behaviors.", "And I, I don’t know, I have a lot to think of. I have a lot to say it like that, isn’t", "Jeremy Goldman: It? Just a matter of a, sorry. And then I’m curious what you think, but isn’t it just a matter of the mechanics of these technologies are such that, you know, that if you don’t use it, it doesn’t actually matter.", "I mean, sure. If everybody, if you had enough of a, like if Kim Kardashians started a whole entire movement to delete Instagram and got her a hundred most famous friends, then I think that you can make a right that maybe that could kill on Instagram, you know, but you alone don’t have the ability to do so.", "There’s so therefore you say, if I can’t, if you can’t beat them, join them. It’s kind of like the wisdom of the crowd or the idiocy of the crowd.", "Also in some situations you know, if you look back at, you know, like any dictator in history that had the support of millions of people none of those millions of people as being shamed because they were with a whole lot of other people said, as long as you stick together, you can’t be that shame by taking the wrong action.", "Jeremy Goldman: Right. And I think that in some ways that that’s what happens in corporate society of every other CEO act that way.", "How can you really, you know, be faulted? Well, I think that’s deeply trouble. It was a very troubling, I mean that’s, you know, Nazi-ism and so on.", "It’s like, yeah, you kind of like nothing bad is going to happen. We’ll just kind of hang and then the worst things can happen if there’s like a local omentum behind them.", "I don’t think it’s enough to say like everyone else is doing it. I don’t know. I think there should be an uprising.", "Frank Cooper: Yeah. Yeah. We’re not going to change the fundamentals of human nature, you know? You know, most of the people are gonna follow the crowd, you know, in gonna fall.", "And so the question is, the opportunity is how do we make the crowd follow things that have a positive impact on the world?", "You know, how do you need to develop it in a way where it’s, it’s easier to adopt and you see the benefit of it in the short term.", "It’s not like a look like, hey, in 10 years from now you’re going to feel really good. No one’s going for that right now.", "And so I think if you look at it through a cultural lens, how do you make them feel? It today, how do you make it more of a movement?", "Right. That’s our opportunity and we’re never gonna well I don’t think in our lifetime we’re going to change human nature in that way.", "Jeremy Goldman: Well it’s interesting almost like by nature, if the definition of it, human nature is, it’s a natural thing that basically maybe you can’t change human nature.", "Maybe you can just say, except this is human nature. How do we gain if I add our to positive. Exactly.", "Alain Sylvain: When you said culturally there’s sort of a motivation to what, how did you put it, you said kind of prioritize revenue over purpose in the United States.", "And I think looking at this from a cultural point of view is it’s really, it’s really [inaudible] because it’s, is it not true to be driven to for convenience?", "Like is is this idea of like I’m not going to care about Amazon or whoever. Is that human nature is convenient human nature or is everybody been conditioned to really want convenience?", "Jeremy Goldman: Cause, I mean, I get to watch my kids, I get to see what the consumers of tomorrow, how they’ll think through that lens.", "I say like, that’s why I had them market research. And you know, because of that you’re able to see what are things that are inherent to us versus what are maybe things that I just had as a kid being born, you know, born in the 70s.", "I mean, maybe there’s certain things that you’re just a product of your culture for the time you were born.", "So how old are the kids or the curiosity? Oh yeah. Let’s see what time? Five and a half. Two and a half and a negative two months", ", so yeah. Thank you. Yeah. So less, less, less time. I got out in New York three years probably. Exactly.", "Yeah. No, thank you. Oh, the price is high if you do during that time.", "Jeremy Goldman: Oh God. Yeah. Price says, especially with my wife left at home. I just know I’m making it up.", "I’m, I’m making it up in spades on this one. I have three kids too. And I definitely future consumption habits through their eyes.", "It’s very interesting. My son fortnight crazy, not like crazy. He plays a lot. And it’s, it’s funny how brands I’ve inserted themselves into your gaming environment and it’s interesting to see you favorite those brands because they’re right.", "So I hear, I hear we should be, yeah, I think another example of that by the way is privacy. You know, because you hear a lot of, I mean I hear a lot of people who are very pro privacy.", "Privacy is great. He got to protect it and all that stuff. I don’t see the younger people who I know and I mean this people young, older than my kids, they, they kind of grew up with the idea of less privacy inherent in their life than we did.", "And I think because of that, they don’t care about it as much because it’s not this inherent thing that they assume that they own.", "Frank Cooper: Well, look, I mean I think that’s the most alarming thing right now is, is the comfort level that somebody younger people have with the use of their data.", "Because if you, if you believe that at some point you have to crush it, whether or not a freak will being shaped by companies, you know, beyond what people will think. They’re like, I don’t think I’m buying this because I want it.", "But actually they figured out exactly your trigger points and they figured out exactly when you would actually be most susceptible to buy it.", "There’s a, there’s a line at which I think it becomes very alarming and so we have to train ourselves and, and educate people broadly about the dangers of, of giving up their data and how that might be used.", "Jeremy Goldman: That’s true. It just depends where okay. With something doesn’t mean it doesn’t actually have adverse effects, you know?", "That’s cool. Complicity. So this goes back to your earlier point about if everybody does it just to do it.", "Jeremy Goldman: And sorry for the abrupt ending there. But honestly I didn’t even think the audio was going to be good enough to use a, it admittedly was maybe like a c plus.", "But I feel like the conversation is such an important one for us to be having and I think it’s a little bit different from some of the things we’ve been running more recently.", "So be sure to let us know what you think and while you’re at it, rate us and review us on apple podcast, stitcher, and wherever finer podcasts are sold.", "Until next time, I’m Jeremy Goldman and you’ve been listening to future proof.", "Jeremy Goldman: Thanks again to Shannon McLay for making the time to join us and thanks to you all for listening.", "We really appreciate it. Things also, by the way, for doing all the other great things you’re doing, like subscribing, rating and reviewing us when ever possible and telling everybody in your network, because that really does help new people find this show and fall in love.", "And Yeah, until next time, I’m Jeremy Holdman and you’ve been listening to future proof"]}

I would say the people I was working with were more influenced by my work than I was.", "I never did a storyboard or any drawing or anything like that. But the set designer, costume designer and people like that really worked very visually.", "There was a bit in the script already - the description of the aunts and the apartments - you can't make it too realistic.", "All of the film, apart from the dream sequence, isn't treated. It's what we actually shot. I didn't work with the colours.", "| Chomet: Although Paul doesn't speak, he has to express a lot of things through the eyes and that's not something you can do in animation.", "The body of the action takes place nowadays in Paris. The backstory is in the Seventies and early Eighties, which I grew up in, so I also have those memories.", "At that time it was very visual - the fashion, cars had a style to it. The Seventies was really the last period I would say, in our culture, when people where trying to make things and design things that were very distinctive.", "We've lost that. Now, everyone has everything, there's not much graphism. There are things you like to draw and things you don't.", "I would much rather draw a two-seat car than a Fiat Punto or something like that, that doesn't have that character.", "The film has a lot of character. Music is very important to your animation and here the music is very interesting.", "I work with a musician - music and drawing is very close. You think it's avant garde but it's all 3/4 time, like a waltz.", "The tango is a waltz, the disco is a waltz, the salsa is a waltz. We used windchimes with Madame Proust because we wanted to have a character who was special when we come into her apartment.", "Also, her ukelele, which is the most opposite intstrument you can find to the piano.", "Where did you start with the kernel of a story. All the characters are very important, so which one did you start with?", "I started with the title. When I was working on Triplets Of Belleville 12 years ago, I came back from the studio and I had in my head Attila Marcel - these two names next to each other.", "It was like a deja vu thing. I knew it was going to be something and I wrote it down. Then a couple of months later, I composed a song Attila Marcel, which was about someone violent, something a bit heavy in the lyrics.", "I was thinking about different things I wanted to develop. I really wanted to do a film which was about music but not to be obviously to be a film where everyone suddenly bursts into song - although there's a couple of scenes like that.", "But the music is the central theme of the film. That's what makes all the memories come back. So, I had all that", "and then I met producer Claudie Ossard on Paris Je t'Aime and I had already a lot of music written - most of them I wrote in North Berwick [in East Lothian],", "so I was looking out the window at sea and it all came. Then I discovered the ukelele. I discovered ukele in Scotland, which is very funny.", "Then, when Claudie said, 'OK, let's go.' Then I just started. I couldn't write the dialogue for Paul as there aren't that many", "Yes and I wanted it to be live action. Straight away I wrote the dialogue and I didn't even start at the beginning.", "I went to a scene and I started to enjoy myself doing the dialogue. Although I never had it in my films, I wrote comic books before and I was writing dialogue for people and some of my comic books are very talkative.", "I like writing dialogue although I wouldn't be good at a novel because I'm not really good at describing things - for me it comes visually.", "But the dialogue, I can write - I'd be very happy to write for theatre. I based everything on the dialogue for the characters.", "Was there any opposition to you making a live action movie. Although you did a segment of Paris Je t'Aime you're known for your animation.", "| Chomet: I've been very influenced by British humour |", "Did Guillaume find that difficult - not being able to talk?", "He didn't show any kind of difficulties but the only thing he said, particularly when you don't have dialogue, you can't lie.", "If your emotion that you bring through your eyes is wrong, it's obvious. The other problem is, if you have dialogue, you can hear yourself, so you always know if you're good or not.", "But he didn't have any, so he had to go to me and say, 'Are you sure it was good?' And he was going back home with his girlfriend - who is also in the film as well, she plays his mum and his wife - and he was asking her, do you think it's okay?", "The idea of memory is very prevalent in the film - is it a subject that particularly interests you?", "Yes, it interests me a lot. I was a child around that period, in the early Eighties, I would be in my 20s but the Seventies was a really strong period for me, so I've got a lot of memories about that.", "I would say that my family would be a lot more like the Attila Marcel family than the aunts. I have a friend whose background is aristocratic and I was invited for a week to spend some time with him and his family in a castle.", "And I was really shocked and I was observing, while I stayed there, how they communicate or they don't communicate but they're all very polite, very clever people - a lot of culture but they don't say much about feelings, they hide a lot of things.", "And it's very much what I tried to do with Paul and his family.", "All of your films have a bit of sadness in them? Is that something that you're conscious of as you're creating these things", "To be honest, I've been very influenced by British humour. There are not many films from France that make me laugh.", "What I really like is British television. There are so many. I think Ricky Gervais [as David Brent in The Office] is an amazing character.", "He's terrible with himself as well. The discomfort and self-despising and it's so human at the same time.", "It's human tragedy. Stephen Merchant as well - they're really brilliant. Otherwise, Fawlty Towers, Blackadder.", "The central characters in your films tend to be quite sweet.", "Because the audience have to care for one of the characters as you go through the film. If they are all monsters, it's very difficult.", "In Italian cinema they have this sense of comic characters who are very lively but also have a lot of distress.", "Most of the characters are unemployed, very old or very sick. Something about humour has to take you away from your real life.", "Do you think you'll do more live action or will it be back to the drawing board?", "I would really like to do live action again. And to do something very different. That experience, for me, was to see could I actually make a film and go through that.", "I really like the result but now I want to do something really different. Something maybe with a camera on the shoulder, much more like documentary.", "Because I know people are going to expect me somewhere and I like the challenge of doing something different.", "In France, the critics don't like that. I have plenty of ideas.", "Attila Marcel is on general release across the UK now. Watch the trailer below:"]}

Yes, Medtronic’s sensor data displays on their insulin pumps.", "But, more importantly, the 530G’s “threshold suspend” feature automatically stops the pump’s basal insulin delivery when the glucose falls below a specified threshold (set by the user).", "The 640G’s “Smartguard” feature temporarily suspends basal delivery when hypoglycemia is approaching.", "There is a significant difference in transmitters. Medtronic’s radio transmitter contains a memory chip that stores up to 40 minutes of data and submits i to the receiver in case the receiver was out of transmission range.", "Dexcom has no such feature. But, Dexcom has much less need for such a feature. The Medtronic signal only travels a few feet and is frequently lost even when in close proximity to the sensor.", "Dexcom’s signal (radio or bluetooth) tends to pick up pretty well as long as the receiver (or phone) is within 20 feet of the transmitter.", "Medtronic’s transmitter must be separated from the sensor and charged at least every six days. Dexcom’s transmitter never requires charging.", "The G4 transmitter tends to last 9-12 months and the G5 transmitter lasts 3 months.", "All Dexcom CGM displays, including those in the Dexcom receiver, phone app and linked pumps, are bright/high contrast and full-color.", "However, the G5 Mobile app has a tendency to “lock up ” from time to time, requiring the user to shut down other programs in order to proceed with data entry.", "The display on the Medtronic 530G is relatively small, monochromatic (black and white), and low-contrast.", "The 640G screen has similar quality to Dexcom. However, many people who use an insulin pump prefer to have a receiver/display that can be carried separately for ease of access and detection of alarms.", "Medtronic’s cell phone app display does offer excellent size and contrast but requires one to carry a “connect” fob in order to send the data from the transmitter to the phone app.", "One of the new benefits of CGM use is the ability to have caregivers and loved ones track the data in real-time on their smartphones and be alerted of potential problems.", "Dexcom pioneered this feature with its SHARE component (available on the G5 and later-model G4 systems).", "Data may be shared with several “followers” and the alerts are fully customization. Medtronic’s mobile app allows followers to be alerted in the event of a crisis, but data cannot be viewed in real-time.", "Dexcom’s download software has some nice features, such as the ability to segment data by day of the week and customize analysis dates.", "However, Dexcom Studio software does not work on Mac systems or integrate with data from an y pumps or meters.", "Dexcom also took a major step backwards with its Clarity app/software (necessary for generating reports from the G5 system).", "Clarity eliminates many of the reporting options and customization features that were popular with Studio.", "Medtronic’s Carelink software is web-based, works on virtually all operating systems, is easy to share with healthcare providers, integrates sensor data with pump and meter data, and generates reports that do a super job of revealing post-meal patterns.", "As the saying goes, “If something can go wrong, it probably will”. there’s something to be said for a system that doesn’t leave a lot to chance.", "Dexcom continues to be very simple to use. Other than learning the sensor insertion (which requires a bit of dexterity) and setting up the mobile app, everything about it is simple.", "There are very few steps, and the steps are all very logical. You put the sensor on, attach the transmitter, calibrate after 2 hours and it works.", "Medtronic’s CGM has a lot of moving parts: finicky transmitters, a multitude of error messages, a lengthy/detailed sensor insertion process and a variety of issues that can impact sensor function and accuracy.", "Case-in-point: I do a lot of traveling, so I decided to count up how many items I had to take with me to maintain my Dexcom G5 compared to the Medtronic Enlite (both using the respective mobile apps).", "I had to tote 10 items to manage my Medtronic sensor changes, but only 3 for Dexcom (see list and photo below).", "Connect device (for transmitting data from pump to phone app)", "** All the stuff needed to use/change/charge the Medtronic sensor w/cell-phone app (left) and Dexcom (right).", "Here is the most important piece. Most people are willing to put up with some minor inconveniences if the system generates reliable data on a consistent basis.", "When reviewing this information, keep in mind that sensor accuracy is best measured in relation to LAB values, not blood glucose meter values.", "Fingerstick values taken with a home-use meter are intrinsically less accurate than lab values, and this contributes to a greater degree of inaccuracy by the CGM.", "But, given that not many of us have a fully equipped lab to tote around all day, the best we can do is evaluate the systems based on how they compared to our handy-dandy meters.", "In my case, I stuck with the meters that are considered to be top-of-the-line for accuracy throughout the comparisons.", "Accuracy is best measured by looking at MARD – Mean Absolute RElative Difference. This represents the difference between fingerstick meter values and sensor glucose values, so a lower MARD is better.", "A calibration reading of 150mg/dl and a sensor value of 120mg/dl represents a MARD of 20% (a 30-point difference on a value of 150).", "The bottom line is this: Medtronic still isn’t up to par with Dexcom when it comes to accuracy. But the gap is narrowing.", "Note that these MARDs are higher than what is seen when using LAB values for calibration purposes. Looking at rates of accuracy, Medtronic’s sensor was closer to the fingerstick calibration 43% of the time; Dexcom was closer 57% of the time.", "There were some interesting accuracy patterns related to day of Sensor use. Unlike earlier versions of both systems, accuracy on “day 1” was not all that bad (19.0% MARD for Medtronic and 14.8% for Dexcom).", "There was a marked difference in accuracy when sensors were used beyond their approved days of use. While Dexcom maintained its accuracy from week one to week two, Medtronic’s accuracy took a major dive when the sensor was used beyond its “approved” six days.", "Both systems continue to underestimate glucose levels more often than overestimating…which is good for those trying their best to avoid hypoglycemia, but not ideal for those who are striving for the tightest control possible.", "Always remember, the comparisons above are based on an “N of 1” (me only). They do not represent the findings from a multi-subject, randomized, controlled study.", "However, I can say that most of what I experienced reflects what I have seen among countless clients/patients who have worn the various CGM systems.", "Dexcom continues to provide a more accurate, user-friendly system, but Medtronic is a step ahead when it comes to data analysis/reporting and integration with automated insulin delivery.", "If this was a boxing match, it would probably be a split decision in favor of Dexcom.", "CGM accuracy continues to improve, but both systems still underestimate glucose levels overall.", "Dexcom sensors appears to maintain their accuracy when used beyond 7-days. Medtronic sensors appear to fall off a cliff accuracy-wise when used beyond six days.", "Personally, I’m very excited about the “next steps” from each company.

Clarity shows an average of 137 mg/dL (6.4%) over a 90-day period.", "For us, it seems it’s algorithm for averages still needs some catching up to do. Why does this matter?", "It’s kind of a downer if the data is wrongly displaying our progress rather than a more accurate number to better motivate us and keep us motivated.", "- Yes, the applicator is easier to use. However, due to it’s non-transparent design, we’re not able to see through it and use our beloved Tegaderm Sandwich method.", "It’s also bulky and creates more waste than the G5. This also makes it less travel-friendly taking up more room in our carry-on suitcase.", "- Per Coral, it still hurts a little [depending on where exactly] we insert the sensor on the arm or thigh.", "She prefers we use prescribed lidocaine numbing cream about 30-45 minutes to insertion.", "- Bluetooth signal loss – it is a major and constant daily annoying problem with the G6 to lose BT signal with both the receiver and my iphone 8 – even when both devices are within the recommended 10ft from her.", "Dexcom will advise to turn the BT signal off and on again and wait a few minutes. They just need to fix this lame and life-affecting problem.", "My only suspicion is perhaps it is due to the slimmer transmitter profile. It for sure does NOT have anything to do on our part as I’ve heard multiple similar complaints from the T1dCommunity on social media.", "- The most Dexcom can do is send a replacement for a failed sensor. For example, one with extremely inaccurate readings majority of the time or one that completely loses signal and gives no readings at all for over 3hrs prematurely to the 10th day.", "I strongly advise all G6 users to call Dexcom immediately for a replacement since most of them are on back-order which can be anywhere from 7-14+ days.", "We always request overnight [shipped via FedEx] and they will typically oblige once they are able to fulfill the order.", "Thankfully, we received that replacement sensor within a decent time-frame. They ship from either Ontario, CA (newest warehouse) or San Diego, CA (original HQ and warehouse).", "This particular replacement came from Ontario. This bit of information is mildly important for estimate day of arrival and awareness of how climate temperatures may affect your sensor or transmitter while in-transit.", "The warmer it is, the less likely the sensor or transmitter will last as long as expected.", "- Restart – We all loved how we could simply “restart” the G5 sensor and keep the transmitter in-tact if experiencing moderate to great accuracy of BG readings (within 10 mg/dL or less).", "Not the case with the G6 as I’ve mentioned above, it is not a simple restart and why would you since it typically gives inaccurate readings or fails near the seventh day?", "- Accuracy – overall, we have experienced better accuracy with the G6s “new” algorithm for the first two sensors of the first box.", "However, I definitely cannot say the same for this current third sensor which I will be changing shortly after writing this blog and calling them for a replacement again.", "- Application process – Inserting the G5 was definitely more intimidating than the G6 given the 2″ needle was visible.", "Correct me if I’m wrong on the size of the needle – either way, it’s a frickin large needle especially for a toddler.", "Yet, we were able to see where exactly the sensor was going to be inserted into her skin. Therefore, allowing us to use our Tegaderm Sandwich method of pre-cut Opsite Flexifix tape used to keep her Dexcom on long as possible and act as a barrier to prevent any skin irritation.", "- The mobile app – G5 mobile app and G6 mobile app only differ in appearance and still is not up to standards as the Sugarmate app for example.", "Both G5 and G6 mobile apps lack an intuitive UI or user interface causing more clicks per function just to adjust ones alert settings.", "- The Apple Watch app – It took Dexcom years to finally develop an app for the Apple watch since the launch of G5.", "Now, with the constant iOS updates and Bluetooth signal loss from our iPhone via receiver, it causes the app on the watch to also lose signal.", "- Insurance – our insurance is through my husbands job and completely covers all dermal medical equipment (DME) supplies without cost.", "However, not all insurance providers will cover the G6, but may do so the G5. I believe this is the case with Medicare or Medical.", "Please do your own research and find out what your co-pays are for either and find the best solution for your self or child before you run out of supplies or if you’re interested in either CGM system.", "As for the device in general, we are thankful for how many times it has actually saved her life especially overnight or during any type of physical activity.", "Basically, when Dex is working great, it sure relieves us of multiple finger pokes and helps us keep her BGs in tighter range for overall better glucose control and lowering and maintaining a healthy a1c (between 6.0 – 6.5% for Coral).", "The very least Dexcom can do is a) address the T1d Community’s concerns and all of these technical issues publicly, b) have all staff and upper management be apologetic, compassionate and properly trained, c) improve both the mobile app and UI of the touchscreen receiver, d) another option – recall the faulty G6!", "It isn’t good enough yet so don’t rush into it. If currently using the G5, request as many sensors from them as you can until they completely transition everyone over to the G6 in 2020.", "The old applicator and painful insertion is worth the trauma and headaches of the new G6. I will gladly tolerate physical pain over mental anxiety and emotional stress.", "Furthermore, I absolutely despise how the G6 mobile app increases the volume and time between repetition of your high alerts regardless of the settings you choose.", "For example, I’ve set the app to alert for highs on repeat every hour, but it will still alert almost every frickin’ 15 minutes.", "It also interrupts you during phone calls. This is a nuisance because 1) I’m never on a phone call unless it’s important, 2) I’ve already corrected her high or she has enough IOB and 3) I will have to constantly raise the high alert and then, gradually bring the high alert back down as she lowers into range just to avoid the disturbingly loud beeping.", "I can see how these alert sound settings would benefit others, but does not apply to our management style.", "The app should just vibrate for a high alert if currently on a phone call and give the option to select “High corrected, vibrate only.”", "Don’t be disappointed if there isn’t another company creating a competitive CGM compatible with almost every smart device any time soon.", "Why? It takes millions of dollars of funding and research to develop a prototype and then a five-year minimum approval period by the FDA.", "So, unless you want to use Medtronic’s enlite sensor or the Freestyle Libre, we’re all stuck with Dexcom like it’s a frickin’ Apple cult.", "Otherwise, my husband would gladly start his own non-invasive glucometer project with a startup of $2.5 million.", "We’ll thankfully accept Venmo payments [half-joking]. Yes, my husband is way more intelligent and skilled than any “engineer” Dexcom currently has on their staff.", "As always, this is just my opinion based on our individual experience. Hopefully, others will have better luck with the G6.", "I know for a fact, a lot of us haven’t because they’ve reached out to me or have commented on my social media posts in agreement.", "Do what’s best for you and/or your child, always continue researching, and make smart decisions.

She is now very excited that the new applicator makes sensor changes far less painful and much easier.", "The new inserter also makes G6 well-suited to one-handed insertion, a plus for those who plan to wear it on the back of the arm (Adam’s preferred wear location).", "Note: This is currently a non-FDA-approved wear location, but G5 and G6 work just fine on the arm, though sometimes tend to under-read “true” glucose in Adam’s experience.", "The biggest downside to the new applicator is how much environmental waste it creates – it’s fully disposable and there is quite a lot of plastic.", "Dexcom does not have a recycling program at this time, though we hope one is added. Diabetes products create a lot of environmental waste already – drug labels, wrappers, infusion sets, strip vials, batteries, etc. – and we hope all future devices keep the environment in mind.", "Obviously, this creates challenging tradeoffs for companies, since improving products and reducing waste can be mutually exclusive.", "G6 is a no-fingerstick-calibration sensor, similar to Abbott’s FreeStyle Libre. After insertion and a two-hour warmup, G6 immediately begins displaying real-time CGM values and trend arrows – no fingerstick entry is required at startup or over the course of the 10-day wear time.", "The startup process is reminiscent of how calibration codes used to be on a vial of strips – e.g., enter “code 25” when opening a new vial of strips.", "In this case, each 10-day G6 sensor comes with a unique four-digit numerical code that must be entered into the app/receiver before starting the two-hour warmup.", "On the G6 app, the four-digit sensor code can be entered via photo (QR code scan) or manually typed in.", "We could not get the app to photo scan the sensor code, despite trying 25 times and on three different sensors.", "In this case, the app allows manual keyboard input. (Interestingly, the transmitter serial number photo scan did work perfectly.)", "We hope Dexcom improves the code scanning process. For those using the receiver, the code can only be entered manually by scrolling up/down.", "Kelly thinks the manual code entry is a bit more of hassle than Adam does (“I’ve worn Libre much more than you have!”).", "Of course, doing this once every 10 days is not that much hassle, and the tradeoff is well worth it for no fingersticks – no question!", "If the sensor code is lost, a user must calibrate with fingersticks quite a bit: twice after the two-hour sensor warmup is complete, a third time 12 hours later, a fourth time 12 hours after that, and then once every 24 hours.", "Relative to FreeStyle Libre’s factory calibration, Dexcom’s G6 is not quite as seamless – each individual G6 sensor code must be scanned or entered before warmup, while FreeStyle Libre requires no such entry (the sensor is simply scanned with the reader and starts the warmup).", "However, based on the labels, G6 is a more accurate device.", "In the big move to eliminate fingerstick calibration, G6 appears to maintain the accuracy of G5 in our experience – and on day one, the sensor performance seems much better.", "For this test drive, Adam wore G6 and G5 head-to-head at the same time, once over 10 days on his abdomen and a second time over 10 days on his arms.", "Relative to 79 Accu-Chek Guide fingersticks, G6 has had an average relative difference (deviation) of only 13.6%, similar to 13.9% for the simultaneously-worn G5.", "Of the 79 comparison fingersticks Adam took, G6 was displaying a corresponding real-time value in 96% of cases, while G5 showed a value in a lower 85% of cases.", "According to G6’s official user guide, the sensor has an average 9.0%-9.8% relative difference vs. laboratory blood glucose values.", "For context, this means if blood sugar is 100 mg/dl on average, G6 will be off from “true” blood glucose value by roughly ~9-10 mg/dl (on average).", "Adam is using G6 in “real-world” use and comparing to a meter, so his relative accuracy has been lower than the “labeled” accuracy.", "A big improvement with G6 is on day one. After the first two-hour warmup, Adam’s first G6 reading was 127 mg/dl, while the meter read 130 mg/dl.", "After the second sensor’s two-hour warmup, G6 read 54 mg/dl, while Adam’s meter read 58 mg/dl. On his just-started third G6 sensor, the first G6 value read 89 mg/dl vs. 88 mg/dl on the meter.", "G6 has also had smoother, more reliable readings than a newly inserted G5, with less jumpiness and gaps on day one.", "See the G6 vs. G5 pictures below for 24-hour comparisons on day one and day seven – they track very well together, but G6 eliminates the fingerstick calibrations!", "G6 users can enter an optional fingerstick calibration – e.g., in cases where the sensor is actually very different from the meter value.", "However, the app and receiver design clearly discourages doing this. The “calibrate” option is buried inside the settings menu, rather than accessible from the app main screen – see below.", "This is a smart way to preserve the feature for when it’s really needed, but nudge against using it. Kelly used this a lot – perhaps once a day.", "Adam avoided using it just to test out the no-calibration accuracy.", "We still have some questions on accuracy and reliability over 10 days, but this is based on our very limited experience.", "Adam got a “sensor error” message on days 8-9 of his first G6 wear session, which resulted in very few data points actually collected on these two days (similar to the “???” symbol that would come up on G4 and G5).", "On his second sensor, Adam saw noticeably worse accuracy on days 9 and 10, with relative errors of 20% or more in many cases (e.g., reading more than 20 mg/dl off when the meter said 100 mg/dl).", "Kelly’s very first G6 sensor did fall off her body after a couple of hours on day one (adhesive failure), something she has never seen with G5 (this happened so fast that she didn’t really count this as her “first” sensor – she felt this was a fluke).", "After 10 days, G6 stops giving real-time readings and prompts the user to insert and start a new sensor.", "Relative to G4 and G5 a big change is the addition of a mandatory shutoff: a G6 sensor cannot be “restarted” to extend the wear time beyond 10 days.", "When trying to do so, the app recognizes it and will not allow the two-hour sensor warmup to complete.", "This is a complicated issue, since many people pay a lot of money for CGM and the ability to extend a single sensor’s wear time – e.g. to 14 days – makes CGM more affordable.", "Dexcom worked with the FDA on this issue and clearly had to make some changes. For instance, G6 achieved an important new FDA classification called “integrated CGM” (iCGM), which regulates it as a lower-risk device (class II).", "Ultimately, this new category will speed CGM innovation, bring improvements faster, and make CGMs easier to integrate with other devices and software (interoperability).", "However, the FDA also ruled that an iCGM must have a mandatory shutoff; hence, it is included in G6. Presumably this protects us against the potential for more inaccurate readings.", "Like FreeStyle Libre (which also has a mandatory shutoff at 10 days), G6 is a no-fingerstick-calibration glucose sensor approved for insulin dosing.", "That puts an even higher bar on accuracy and reliability. For now, G6 has been tested and approved for 10-day wear, meaning Dexcom and the FDA cannot be assured of insulin-dosing safety or accuracy beyond 10 days.", "However, Dexcom does plan to do a 14-day wear trial of G6 in the second half of this year.", "We’d like to see an end to complaints about not being able to “extend” the system – or even whether it’s possible.", "It’s been decided, and we believe this decision is in the best interests of people with diabetes, the system, and providers.", "The Bluetooth-enabled G6 transmitter is meaningfully slimmer than G5, and should be less susceptible to getting knocked on things.", "The transmitter is now flush with the plastic sensor cradle, rather than rising above it like with G5.", "The picture below compares G5 and G6 on Adam’s abdomen. Kelly was impressed with the new transmitter, and pointed out that it returned to “more” (but better) what the transmitter used to look like with the Seven Plus and early G4; it was really G5 that made the transmitter larger with the addition of Bluetooth.", "Like G5, the G6 transmitter is reused for three months, at which point it is thrown away.

On Adam’s older iPhone SE, the G6 app has meaningfully reduced the size of the CGM bubble/trend arrow, and this cannot be adjusted in size.", "The new G6 app design also leaves more white space on the screen and mutes the colors a bit.

It is not a smartphone quality touchscreen, but it is better than we expected.", "Hitting the home button wakes up the receiver and shows the CGM graph and value; to interact with the receiver, a user must tap “1-2” to unlock the device – similar to Tandem’s t:slim insulin pump.", "Like G5, users can view G6 CGM data with only the app, only the receiver, or both at the same time. The transmitter has retained the “brains” and allows for seamless switching between the displays.", "We found them very easy to toggle between and saw no lag between them.", "Dexcom is currently “putting plans in place” to file G6 with FDA so that purchasing a receiver becomes optional.", "Medtronic’s Guardian Connect CGM received the first FDA approval earlier this year for smartphone-only display.", "Please send us your questions!
