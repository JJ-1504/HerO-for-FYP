Released June 18, 2019", "In Q1 2019, the U.S. solar market installed 2.7 gigawatts direct current (GWdc) of solar photovoltaic (PV) capacity, a 10% increase year-over-year and the strongest Q1 in the industry’s history.", "After a year in which the residential sector grew 8%, the rebound continued, with the sector experiencing a third consecutive quarter with more than 600 MWdc added.", "Conversely, non-residential PV suffered both quarterly and annual declines due to policy transitions and interconnection issues in key markets.", "The quarter was buoyed by 1.6 GW of utility-scale installations, with new project procurement growing the contracted pipeline to nearly 28 GW.", "Across all market segments, solar PV accounted for 51% of all new electricity generating capacity additions in Q1 2019.", "Further, solar surpassed the 2 million installation milestone in Q1 2019, after reaching the first million just three years ago in 2016.", "After growing 8 percent in 2018, the residential solar market grew 5% on a year-over-year basis and is effectively tied for the second-largest quarter since Q4 2016.", "Since bottoming out in Q3 2017, quarterly growth in five of the last six quarters suggests that the market is adopting a more sustainable growth profile, with a mix of local and regional installers operating alongside national installers.", "However, state markets with higher penetration levels and increasing customer-acquisition costs continue to struggle with flat or declining installations on a quarterly basis.", "The continued emergence of new markets has helped to sustain robust installation volumes nationally.", "Unlike the residential market, a handful of state-specific regulatory cliffs and policy reforms that took effect in 2018 continued to impact non-residential installations in Q1 2019.", "Major policy reforms in the core non-residential markets of California and Massachusetts are still hampering development.", "In the case of California, installations were flat on both a year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter basis, which suggests that installation declines stemming from the transition to new time-of-use rates may be abating.", "Massachusetts is still being negatively impacted by the transition to its new incentive program, which has slowed most non-residential development.", "As the state transitions to the new SMART program, utility interconnection approvals for qualified projects are taking much longer than anticipated, leaving most projects waiting months, if not years, to interconnect and begin earning SMART tariff revenue.", "This has resulted in market declines on both a year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter basis.", "Utility PV maintained the largest share of installations in the U.S. solar market this quarter – 1.6 GWdc of utility PV capacity came online in Q1 2019, representing 61% of quarterly capacity additions.", "With 4.7 GWdc of projects under construction, 2019 is on track to be a strong year for utility PV, with 46% growth over 2018 expected.", "After a record 15.0 GWdc of U.S. utility solar was procured in 2018, new project announcements have slowed slightly in 2019 but levels still remain healthy.", "As of May 2019, 3.8 GW have been procured, pushing the contracted pipeline to 27.7 GW. The growth is primarily due to a 1.5 GWdc announcement from Florida Power & Light and 1.1 GWdc announced by Duke Energy in the Carolinas.", "Florida Power & Light’s development of its own solar projects makes up the bulk of Florida’s five-year forecast, with additional announcements from Duke Florida, Teco Energy and Jacksonville Electric expected to add to the pipeline in that state.", "Voluntary procurement of utility PV based on its economic competitiveness continues to be the primary driver of projects announced in 2019.", "While many states, utilities and cities have announced or proposed 50% or 100% renewable energy or zero-carbon standards, the announcements have not yet resulted in an uptick in RPS-driven procurement.", "Corporate procurement of utility solar drove 22% of projects announced in 2018 and continues apace in 2019, with 14% of projects announced having a corporate offtaker.", "(Wood Mackenzie classifies large offsite projects with C&I offtakers as utility-scale rather than distributed due to the size and structure of the deals.)", "As the number of corporations pledging to use 100% renewable power continues to grow, corporate procurement is expected to remain a strong driver of utility PV.", "Despite steady installations in Q1 2019, the residential market is still highly reliant on legacy state markets, such as California and the Northeast, which have seen only modest to flat growth over the past several quarters.", "As these major state markets continue to grow past early-adopter consumers, higher costs of customer acquisition will challenge the industry to innovate product offerings and diversify geographically.", "Indeed, 29% of residential capacity in Q1 2019 came from markets outside the top 10 (by cumulative capacity), the highest share for emerging markets in industry history.", "From 2019-2021, residential growth will range from 5%-20% due to both emerging markets with strong resource fundamentals like Florida and Texas, and markets where recent policy developments have increased our near-term forecasts.", "Maryland’s recent renewable portfolio standard increase, the removal of South Carolina’s net metering cap, and new incentive programs such as Illinois’ Adjustable Block Program will provide significant upside and growth to our residential forecasts over the next few years.", "Meanwhile, California’s new home solar mandate will also help to offset market penetration challenges beginning in 2020.", "In the long term, the ITC step-down is expected to pull in demand in both legacy and emerging markets before declining in 2022.", "Growth resumes in 2023 and continues into 2024 based on economic fundamentals as the market adjusts to post-ITC market conditions.", "That said, long-term growth in a post-ITC world will be contingent on geographic diversification outside of legacy state markets and technological/business-model innovation to improve product offerings in solar-plus-storage.", "Non-residential installation totals in Q1 2019 were the weakest since Q1 2017 as all three major state markets (California, Massachusetts and Minnesota) saw declining volumes due to state-level policy reforms and interconnection delays that continue to limit development opportunities.", "Overall, the non-residential PV market is on track for another down year as the segment acclimates to a reduced incentive environment across major state markets.", "However, this will be incrementally offset starting in 2020 as the next wave of states with robust community solar mandates – New York, Maryland, Illinois and New Jersey – experience growth.", "Furthermore, recent policy developments in New York and Maryland will ultimately provide for growth in our long-term outlook.", "Significant revisions to the Value of Distributed Energy Resources (VDER) docket in New York have bolstered our long-term forecasts for both commercial and community solar, while an RPS increase in Maryland will boost the sagging SREC market to the benefit of the entire non-residential segment.", "Increasing solar-plus-storage viability will also begin to have an impact on non-residential demand as policymakers and business leaders increasingly consider energy storage in their decisions.", "New York’s recent development of the Bridge Incentive increases our long-term solar-plus-storage forecasts with further potential upside.", "By 2023, roughly 30% of total non-residential PV will come from community solar, and ~20% will come from solar-plus-storage projects.", "The U.S. utility solar forecast for 2019-2024 has grown by 5.1 GWdc since last quarter. The largest contributor is an increase to Florida’s five-year outlook from 6.0 GWdc to 9.0 GWdc due to new solar procurement by Florida Power & Light (FPL), Duke Energy Florida, and other Florida utilities (most of which is utility self-build).", "This positions Florida to be the top state for utility PV over the next six years.", "Since last quarter, the 2019 forecast has grown by 1.2 GW, due largely to late project announcements in Texas that raised the state’s forecast by 720 MWdc.", "While the forecast for 2020 saw little change to overall expected capacity additions, over 10.0 GWdc of utility PV are still expected to come online that year.", "From 2021-2023, our utility PV forecast has increased by 2.8 GWdc. While the bulk of this increase is found in Florida, there are a growing number of utilities such as Xcel Energy, Idaho Power and PacifiCorp, among others, announcing additional solar procurement, expedited coal plant retirement, or plans to achieve 50% to 100% renewable or carbon-free energy targets, all of which have boosted the midterm forecast.", "During this time, utility PV also becomes increasingly competitive with wind. As the wind-focused federal Production Tax Credit steps down, solar begins to fall below the cost of wind on a levelized cost of energy (LCOE) basis in many traditional wind states such as Illinois, Iowa, Kansas, Michigan and the Dakotas by the mid-2020s.", "(Wood Mackenzie’s LCOE calculations for solar take the ITC incentive into account.) This is likely not only to drive more solar procurement in wind-dominant regions of Midcontinent Independent System Operator and Southwest Power Pool, but also to make solar the preferred renewable technology for corporate offtakers.", "Oklahoma Gas & Electric’s recent RFP for solar-plus-storage is the first example of what is likely to be a trend in solar procurement in the Prairies and Midwest.", "Our 2024 forecast has also increased by 1.1 GWdc. Many utilities such as Dominion, Tennessee Valley Authority and FPL have outlined solar procurement plans for 2024 and beyond.", "Despite the ITC having fully stepped down to 10% by that time, utility PV will remain economically competitive with new-build wind and natural gas in many places.", "We employ a bottom-up modeling methodology to track and report national average PV system pricing for the major market segments.", "This methodology is based on tracked wholesale pricing of major solar components and data collected from interviews with major installers.", "In Q1 2019, system pricing fell in all market segments. System pricing fell by 3.0%, 2.7%, 0.1% and 0.1% in the residential, non-residential, utility fixed-tilt and utility single-axis tracking markets, respectively.", "Prices across market segments are now all at historic lows despite tariffs on modules, inverters, aluminum and steel: $2.89/Wdc, $1.47/Wdc, $0.93/Wdc and $1.04/Wdc for residential, non-residential, utility fixed-tilt and utility single-axis tracking systems, respectively.", "Year-over-year system pricing fell by 6.8%, 9.8%, 12.6% and 12.9% in the residential, non-residential, utility fixed-tilt and utility single-axis tracking markets, respectively.", "U.S. solar market insightÂ® is a quarterly publication of Wood Mackenzie Power & Renewables, Inc. d/b/a Greentech Media and the Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA)Â®.", "Each quarter, we collect granular data on the U.S. solar market from nearly 200 utilities, state agencies, installers and manufacturers.", "This data provides the backbone of this U.S. solar market insightÂ® report, in which we identify and analyze trends in U.S. solar demand, manufacturing and pricing by state and market segment.", "We also use this analysis to look forward and forecast demand over the next five years. All forecasts are from Wood Mackenzie, Limited; SEIA does not predict future pricing, bid terms, costs, deployment or supply.", "Our coverage in these reports includes 43 individual states and Washington, D.C. However, the national totals reported include all 50 states, Washington, D.C. and Puerto Rico.", "The U.S. solar market insightÂ® is offered in two versions – the Executive Summary and the Full Report.", "The Executive Summary is free, and the Full Report is available individually each quarter or as part of an annual subscription.", "Detailed data and forecasts by state are available in the Full Report. To find out more, click here.", "Note on U.S. solar market insight report title: WM P&R and SEIA have changed the naming convention for the U.S. solar market insight report series.", "Starting with the report released in June 2016 onward, the report title will reference the quarter in which the report is released, as opposed to the most recent quarter in which installation figures are tracked.", "The exception will be our year in review publication, which covers the preceding year’s installation volumes despite being released during the first quarter of the current year."]}

For solar, with enthusiastic rooftop troops, it’s controversial.", "“We’ve been in the process of adding substantial wind for over a decade,” Kent Larson, Xcel’s executive vice president and group vice president for operations, told POWER.", "“We have 6,500 MW of wind, and we’d like to have more.” Larson noted that Xcel, with a service territory mostly in the upper Midwest, has “some of the best wind resources in the country.”", "The company is also looking to add substantial solar photovoltaic generation to its system and says it will add 1,800 MW of wind and 1,400 MW of solar by 2030.", "Xcel CEO Ben Fowke at a Wall Street investment conference last December rolled out a $15.2 billion capital investment plan, which calls for a lot of wind and solar, along with transmission upgrades to get renewable generation to consumers.", "Fowke called the plan “steel for fuel,” where wind turbines, made with lots of steel, offset the need to pay fuel suppliers for coal and gas plants.", "Not incidentally, the company’s carbon dioxide (CO2) reduction target is more ambitious than the one in the Obama administration’s Clean Power Plan.", "Xcel is aiming for a 60% cut in CO2 emissions by 2030—double the administration’s target.", "When President Obama announced the details of his plan to cut CO2 emissions from coal-fired power plants, Xcel was largely supportive.", "The company was part of the White House ceremony unveiling the final Clean Power Plan last summer. Fowke said, “While we expect the Clean Power Plan does not provide everything we hoped for in terms of fully recognizing the early actions of proactive states and utilities, Xcel Energy is ready to move ahead.”", "Larson said, “Ten years ago, we embraced the goal of being the environmental leader in our industry,” adopting plans to buy wind and build the necessary transmission to bring the power to customers.", "The utility is on a path to reduce its carbon emissions 30% by 2020, well ahead of the administration’s plan.", "Larson noted that there were advantages to moving out first in the renewables race. “We did the work way ahead of the rush” brought on by the impending governmental move away from fossil fuels, he said.", "“We were able to do it ahead of time, at our pace, and cost-effectively.” Larson added that Xcel also has developed “by far the best wind forecasting system” in the industry as a result of experience gained in its long embrace of wind power.", "The American Wind Energy Association (AWEA) ranks Xcel as the leading wind energy utility in the U.S. MidAmerican is second, followed by Southern California Edison, Pacific Gas & Electric, and American Electric Power.", "Xcel has been at the top of AWEA’s ranking for a decade.", "The company is moving away from power purchase contracts for wind and toward direct ownership. The Minneapolis Star Tribune newspaper noted, “In its four most recent wind farm deals in Minnesota and North Dakota, Xcel purchased three of the projects from the developers and signed a power purchase deal on the fourth.”", "Larson acknowledged that utility-owned wind is the company’s preferred approach.", "For the utility, buying the wind farms outright adds to the company’s rate base, on which it earns a regulated return.", "“If you do it right,” says Fowke, “you can grow the rate base and not increase customer cost because you just reduce your use of gas.”", "That means cash flowing to the company’s bottom line. Larson acknowledged that owning renewable generation also allows the utility to take advantage of subsidies.", "Fowke said that the company’s plan “won’t see us getting overly dependent on natural gas in the future even as we transition away from coal.", "The reason is that we are replacing it with renewables, with gas backstopping growing generation from intermittent wind and solar.”", "The gas plants, he said, “are not going to be used as much.”", "Recent deals demonstrate Xcel’s embrace of wind as an owned resource. In May 2015, Xcel agreed to acquire the incomplete Border Wind Farm in Rolette County, N.D., with 150 MW of capacity from 75 wind turbines, for $300 million (Figure 1).", "The project had been unable to line up a power purchase agreement, according to the Star Tribune. In November, Xcel bought the operating 200-MW Pleasant Valley Wind Farm near Austin, Minn., for an undisclosed amount.", "That plant had a power purchase agreement with Xcel. Both plants were developed by RES America Developments Inc.", "| 1. Wind leader. Xcel is ranked as the leading wind energy utility in the U.S. Among its holdings is the 150-MW Border Wind Farm in North Dakota.", "The Star Tribune observed that “Xcel has more than 50 wind farm power-purchase agreements in Minnesota, according to state data.”", "It is unclear which of these Xcel may be looking to buy out and what the timing of deals might be. Any future acquisitions may require a green light from utility regulators.", "Xcel is also bullish on solar at large scale, although not at smaller installations outside of its control and balance sheet.", "Discussing the company’s second-quarter earnings during a July conference call with analysts and reporters last year, Fowke said Xcel views solar “as an important growing component of our resource mix.", "However, we want to make sure that it’s done at the most attractive price point for our customers.” That means, on Xcel’s books.", "Last March, Minnesota regulators approved the company’s plan for three big solar installations, including a 100-MW project near North Branch, Minn.", "Fowke said that “Xcel Energy continues to be a major advocate of solar.” In Colorado, Xcel began taking power in late December under a contract from SunPower’s 50-MW Hooper photovoltaic project in the San Luis Valley.", "Xcel is already contracted to take power from two other SunPower plants in the valley, the 19-MW Greater Sandhill plant (Figure 2), completed in 2010 and the 30-MW San Luis Valley Solar Ranch, which reached commercial operation in 2012.", "| 2. Sandhill solar. The 19-MW Greater Sandhill solar photovoltaic plant has been generating power in Alamosa County, Colorado, for Xcel since 2010.", "But the company remains careful about embracing customer-owned solar power and distributed generation.", "Xcel looks askance at distributed solar, either on customers’ rooftops or in community solar developments on economic grounds.", "(See “Solar Gardens: A Fast-Growing Approach to Photovoltaic Power” in the May 2015 issue for more on community solar, including an installation near Boulder, Colo.", "Since 2005, Xcel Energy and the city of Boulder, Colo., home to the flagship campus of the University of Colorado, have been in a fight over the city’s wish to oust Xcel as the electricity provider and replace it with a new municipal utility.", "If past municipalization efforts are a guide, the dispute is likely to take many more years to conclude, perhaps decades; the city is likely to lose.", "In 1999, Las Cruces, N.M., threw in the towel after a 30-year battle with investor-owned El Paso Electric over the city’s attempt to create a municipal utility.", "The move was driven by the high costs of El Paso’s share of the Palo Verde Nuclear Generating Station in Arizona.", "Similarly, the city of New Orleans in 1990 gave up a decades-long war with Entergy over municipalization, driven in part by Entergy’s high-cost nuclear program.", "Boulder’s interest in forming a municipal utility is related to its view that Xcel isn’t sufficiently dedicated to renewables, particularly distributed solar, and to ending its use of fossil-fueled generation and reducing greenhouse gas emissions.", "The city gets about 70% of its power from Xcel’s largely coal-fired Colorado power generating fleet. Boulder first demonstrated its interest in forming a city-owned utility, which would entail buying out Xcel’s distribution assets, in 2005, when it commissioned consultants R.W. Beck of Seattle to do a feasibility study.", "The Beck analysis suggested that forming a muni could achieve the city’s goals for greater renewable generation at lower cost.", "Negotiations between Boulder and Xcel began in 2006. In 2010, Boulder refused to renew its 20-year franchise with Xcel.", "In 2011, city voters approved moving forward with a plan to buy out Xcel. Last summer, the city asked the Colorado Public Utilities Commission (PUC) to approve the transfer of Xcel assets to the city.", "The PUC denied the request last November as too broad. An Xcel spokeswoman said that the city “will now have the opportunity to supplement and correct their plan in this proceeding, but we hope the city leaders will instead be willing to work together with us to help develop a plan for Boulder to achieve the carbon-reduction it had set as its goal for municipalization.”", "The utility has resisted losing a substantial part of the infrastructure upon which it earns a regulated return.", "The dollar impacts are large, so Xcel is willing to spend considerable amounts to defend its ownership of its assets in the city.", "The city is likewise willing to spend big money to try to expropriate Xcel’s distribution system. Kent Larson, Xcel’s executive vice president and group vice president for operations, told POWER that the company “is taking the high road” in the Boulder dispute, continuing to serve its customers in the city while also developing more renewable generation in Colorado, including new wind resources.", "“We will continue doing a good job with our customers,” he said. If history is a guide, the battle of Boulder, involving scores of millions of dollars on both sides, is likely to rage on for many years and end in some sort of compromise settlement.", "History also suggests that, regardless of the outcome, the lawyers and consultants representing the city and the utility will do very well indeed.", "Boulder’s Daily Camera reported on December 30 that the city had already spent “just under $7 million exploring and pursuing municipalization . . .", "with the majority of those funds coming from a voter-approved utility occupation tax.” |", "Here’s the economic issue as far as Xcel is concerned. Utility-owned solar has significant advantages of scale, as well as providing assets for the utility’s rate base.", "Customer-owned solar, by Xcel’s reckoning, imposes costs on the utility—and its non-solar customers—for grid support and ancillary services to keep the grid stabilized.", "The company has been in a protracted dispute with solar advocates and regulators over Minnesota’s permissive approach to community solar and rooftop generation.", "According to Fowke, “While solar gardens and rooftop solar have a place in our portfolio as an option for consumers, because they require heavy, heavy subsidization on non-participants, you’ll see us advocate that the primary focus be utility-scale solar so that we can keep energy costs affordable for consumers.”", "That puts Xcel squarely on the investor-owned utility side of a raging dispute in the industry over the way to value distributed solar photovoltaic power (see the October 23, 2015, post, “The Solar PV Economics Conundrum”).", "While Xcel moves toward its renewable energy goals, it faces continued controversy over the company’s coal legacy, as coal remains important to Xcel’s operations in Minnesota and elsewhere.", "Overall, Xcel has 25 coal-fired units at 12 locations (seven in Colorado), with a total of 7,409 MW in capacity.", "Gas capacity is 6,877 MW from 70 units at 25 stations. Xcel has three nuclear units totaling 1,594 MW, 377 MW of hydro, and 327 MW of company-owned wind (on top of over 6,000 MW of wind under contract).", "Xcel’s largest generator is the coal-fired Sherburne County (Sherco) Generating Station (Figure 3) in Becker, Minn., a three-unit, 2,222-MW plant located on the Mississippi River near the Twin Cities.", "The plant burns Powder River Basin coal and sells some steam to a nearby paper mill.", "| 3. Coal king. At 2,222 MW, the Sherburne County (Sherco) Generating Station is the largest of Xcel’s plants.", "Environmental activists have been pushing Xcel to shut down Sherco. The company initially resisted, saying it wanted to keep the first two 750-MW units, built in the 1970s, running until 2030.", "Xcel did not propose closing the third Sherco unit, vintage 1980s. Last October, following the unveiling of the Clean Power Plan, Xcel filed a plan with Minnesota regulators to shut Sherco 2 in 2023 and Sherco 1 in 2026 and replace them with gas-fired combined cycle generation.", "It intends to continue running Sherco 3, a 860-MW unit; Xcel owns 60% of that unit while Southern Minnesota Municipal Power Agency owns the balance.", "Xcel Energy is the product of a series of mergers from 1995 to 2005. The parent company was Northern States Power (NSP), headquartered in Minneapolis, the dominant utility in the state.", "NSP began life in 1909 as a result of moves by engineer and entrepreneur Henry Marison Byllesby, whose mentors were Thomas Edison and Samuel Insull.", "During the early 20th century, Byllesby acquired utilities in Illinois, Oklahoma, and Ohio and formed a company in Minnesota, which became Northern States Power in 1916.", "The utility grew to become the major investor-owned utility in the state, before it went on the buying spree of the late 20th century, transforming itself into a regional utility superpower.", "NSP in the mid-1990s tried a $6 billion merger with Milwaukee-based Wisconsin Energy Corp., which would have created a company to be known as “Primergy.”", "That deal fell apart after Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) staff raised serious objections.", "Xcel was born in 2000 as NSP gobbled up a conglomerate known as New Century Energies. New Century was the product of a 1995 merger of Denver-based Public Service of Colorado and Southwestern Public Service Co. of Amarillo, Texas.", "During the 1990s, NSP created a successful non-utility generating company, NRG Energy. In 2000, Xcel spun off NRG in a public stock offering.", "Xcel ended up owning about 80% of NRG shares. NRG went into Chapter 11 bankruptcy reorganization in 2003, emerging clear of much of the debt it carried after the spin-off from Xcel.", "Today, Xcel Energy is a large, multi-state utility electric-and-gas holding company with a diverse electric generating profile and operations in many different markets.", "The company operates in Minnesota, Colorado, Michigan, New Mexico, North Dakota, South Dakota, Texas, and Wisconsin.", "With $11.7 billion in revenues in 2014, the company saw $1 billion in profits. Electricity revenues in 2014 totaled $9.5 billion.", "The Xcel utilities had 3.5 million electricity customers, 17,019 MW in nameplate generating capacity, 93,100 miles of transmission, and 196,899 miles of electric distribution infrastructure.", "Natural gas distribution revenues totaled $2.1 billion for 2014, with 2 million customers, 2,405 miles of transmission pipelines, and 34,091 miles of distribution pipelines.", "What’s ahead for Xcel Energy? As with many electric generators in transition, the future is far from clear, although the general direction might be discernible through the fog of politics, regulation, and economics.", "The company’s focus on moving from coal to renewables, particularly wind, appears likely to continue.", "In Minnesota, the company got 14% of its electricity from wind in 2014. Xcel says it hopes to see that grow to 25% by 2030, the target date for achieving the goals of the federal government’s Clean Power Plan—assuming the regulatory regime survives court scrutiny and, perhaps, a new administration in Washington less focused on reducing CO2.", "Even if the federal plan collapses, Xcel will continue its transition to renewables.", "Look for Xcel to continue converting power purchase agreements with non-utility wind generators into utility-owned projects.", "It’s also likely that large-scale solar investments will be high on the company’s capital agenda.", "“It’s been a journey for us,” said Larson. “We started down this path more than a decade ago, and we have plans to continue for the next decade, in a great partnership with our policy makers.”", "Xcel believes it is on the leading edge of an industry-wide transition that will play out over several years.", "How will investors view that green-oriented strategy? The Motley Fool investment website, which collects a number of analysts’ recommendations, says the best strategy for investors is largely a wait-and-see play on Xcel.", "Four analysts who follow the company rate it a strong buy, and eight call Xcel a “hold.” ■", "—Kennedy Maize is a long-time energy journalist and frequent contributor to POWER."]}

Second, there is a need to learn more if NNSO abide by or comply with efficiency requirements possibly set by themselves or by funders.", "In other words, are NNSOs required to be financially efficient? If so by who and to what extent? For example, for every tax dollar allocated by the government, what percentage needs to go into services and programmes?", "How do NNSO know that they are financially efficient? Do the NNSOs prefer the use of financial ratios as indicators of financial efficiency?", "Finally, is there an urgent need to improve our understanding about why most NNSOs are ineffective? Is it that they do not see the need?", "Or is there no regulatory, legal or policy mandates for them to do so. Or is it that they are faced with too many financial constraints such as depending almost entirely on stringent donation and handouts.", "Apart from the need for managerial effectiveness, we can also pose the question of who will discipline the management for poor financial performance.", "Future research could investigate the possible reasons for the performance.

I have called this the \"perfect storm\" of ICFR — the confluence of the implementation of the 2013 COSO Internal Control Framework,[1] with the steps being taken by many external audit firms to respond to deficiencies noted in PCAOB inspections related to their audits of internal control.[2]", "I can still say that we are weathering the storm well, as auditors have focused on improving the quality of their audits of ICFR while companies have focused on adopting the 2013 COSO framework.[3]", "However, we continue to see significant challenges with ICFR across the system.", "I hope that our discussion today will spur your thinking on important issues relating to ICFR, including the following points that I will discuss in more detail:", "- ICFR audit deficiencies continue to be the most frequent inspection findings, which is a concern. Yet, we may be seeing the beginning of a positive trend line, and I am hopeful that the number and nature (severity) of ICFR findings will continue to decline.", "- The data on adverse opinions on ICFR are \"noisy\" in several respects and present opportunities for additional inquiry and study.", "For instance, the data show an apparent contradiction that would benefit from additional inquiry: an overall increase in the percentage of adverse opinions on ICFR while, at the same time, an overall increase in the percentage of \"clean ICFR\" opinions for issuers that announce a restatement.", "- The data does not indicate any systemic impact on audit fees that could be attributable to recent changes in ICFR auditing or inspections.", "However, there are variations in audit teams' and firms' effectiveness in implementing changes to their ICFR audit procedures, which may be impacting the amount of audit work for some issuers.", "Keep in mind that sometimes audit fees are impacted by the simple fact that issuers have inadequate controls.", "First, PCAOB inspections of ICFR audits: It is generally accepted that effective audits of ICFR can have a positive impact on public companies and, ultimately, investors and the public at large.[4]", "They promote effective management practices and can provide transparency into material weaknesses to help audit committees and investors with their decision-making.[5] Among other things, ICFR audits that comply with PCAOB standards should increase the likelihood that material weaknesses in internal control will be found before they lead to material misstatements in the financial statements.[6]", "Beginning primarily in the 2010 inspections cycle, PCAOB inspections included a heightened focus on whether firms had obtained sufficient audit evidence to support audit opinions on the effectiveness of ICFR.", "The number and significance of deficiencies in firms' audits of ICFR in the 2010 and 2011 inspections were high.", "In December 2012, the Board issued a report, Observations from 2010 Inspections of Domestic Annually Inspected Firms Regarding Deficiencies in Audits of Internal Control over Financial Reporting.[8]", "The report provides information about the nature and frequency of deficiencies in firms' audits of internal control detected during the PCAOB's 2010 inspections of eight domestic registered firms that have been inspected every year since the PCAOB's inspection program began.", "The Board's subsequent inspections continued to identify high levels of deficiencies in the audits of internal control, which led to the issuance of Staff Audit Practice Alert No. 11, Considerations for Audits of Internal Control over Financial Reporting, on October 24, 2013.[9]", "The practice alert discusses the application of certain requirements of AS 5 and other PCAOB standards to specific aspects of the audit of internal control that had been frequently cited as deficient in PCAOB inspection reports.", "The practice alert also discusses potential root causes of the deficiencies, and provides guidance for auditors in various aspects of auditing ICFR.", "Table 1 below shows the increasing numbers of audit deficiencies related to ICFR reported in PCAOB inspection reports for the U.S. domestic Big 4 firms.", "Table 1: Inspection Findings for U.S. Domestic Big 4 Firms, 2010-2013", "Inspected Audits with Deficiencies in the Public Inspection Report |", "Total Integrated Audits Inspected, U.S. Big Four Firms |", "Integrated Audits ICFR Deficiencies in the Public Inspection Report |", "% of Integrated Audits with ICFR Audit Deficiencies in the Public Report |", "Although firms have been making some progress in their remediation efforts in this area, some firms still have significant work to do to meet the requirements of PCAOB auditing standards in this area.", "During the 2014 inspection cycle, the most frequent areas of ICFR audit deficiencies were in the following areas:[11]", "- Selecting the appropriate controls to test, based on those that are important to the auditor's conclusion about whether the company's controls sufficiently address the assessed risk of misstatement (AS No. 5.39).", "- Testing design effectiveness to determine whether the company's controls satisfy the control objectives and can effectively prevent or detect errors or fraud that could result in material misstatements (AS No 5.42).", "- Testing the operating effectiveness of the controls (AS No. 5.44).", "Audit engagement teams often did not obtain an understanding of a company's flow of transactions in order to identify and select the appropriate controls to test.", "In certain other cases, inspections staff observed that auditors selected controls to test that were not responsive to the fraud risks that they had identified.", "In addition, audit engagement teams continue to struggle with the testing of management review controls in that they often did not evaluate whether the management review controls operated at the necessary level of precision that would address the assessed risk of material misstatement.", "Inspections staff have also seen engagement teams rely on management review controls to compensate for other identified deficiencies without fully understanding or appropriately testing whether that management review control operated effectively at the necessary level of precision.", "Although the results of PCAOB's 2014 inspections of audit firms indicate that some improvements have been made in the area of auditing ICFR, deficiencies by audit firms in the audits of ICFR continued to be the most frequent findings in the 2014 inspections.", "I should also note that beginning with the 2013 inspection reports (generally issued in 2014), PCAOB inspections staff began to include references in the Part I inspection findings to the specific, applicable auditing standard, as well as summary tables of the findings by specific auditing standards.", "This information should be useful to academics and researchers who are interested in tracking trends and developments in PCAOB inspection findings.", "The 2015 inspection cycle is currently in process, and it is too early to identify trends. While our staff has seen more examples where auditors have gotten the auditing of ICFR right, they also continue to identify frequent findings in this area.", "I am hopeful that the number and nature (severity) of findings will continue to decline, and that this may be the beginning of a positive trend in PCAOB inspection results related to audits of ICFR.", "As you know, effective audits of ICFR are an important accountability mechanism to help promote effective internal control while also providing transparency into any material weaknesses that exist.", "The auditor's objective in an audit of ICFR is to express an opinion on the effectiveness of the company's internal control over financial reporting.[12]", "So let's look at the population of issuer audits, and issuer ICFR audits, in particular. Of the approximately 9,067 active issuers as of December 31, 2014,[13] approximately 3,874 had an audit report that included an auditor's opinion on ICFR for a fiscal period ending during 2014.[14]", "Of these, 231 audit reports contained an auditor's adverse opinion on the company's ICFR in which the auditor reported at least one material weakness in ICFR, meaning that the company's ICFR was ineffective.[15]", "In other words, about 6 percent of issuers filing an auditor's ICFR audit opinion in 2014 received an adverse audit opinion on ICFR.", "This reflects an upward trend in the percentage of audits with an adverse opinion on ICFR over the past five years, as shown in figure 1 below:", "In my view, the increase in opinions between 2010 and 2014 is notable, going from 138 to 231, as seen in table 2, and representing a significant increase.", "It is also notable that the PCAOB began putting significant focus and emphasis on audits of ICFR in its 2010 inspections—a focus that has continued since then.", "Table 2: Percentage of Adverse ICFR Opinions 2010 - 2014", "Despite this trend of increasing numbers of adverse ICFR opinions, there is other data that also suggest there may be room for improvement in identifying and disclosing material weaknesses.", "For example, a restatement of prior period financial statements to correct a material misstatement is an indicator of a material weakness in ICFR,[17] and the rate of restatements continues to exceed the rate of opinions with material weaknesses.", "In 2014, approximately 438 (or 11.3 percent) of the 3,874 companies with audit opinions on ICFR restated their financial statements from prior years.[18]", "The rate of financial restatements among companies with ICFR opinions has increased in recent years, from 7.0 percent in 2010 to over 11 percent, as shown in figure 2 below:", "Figure 2: Financial Restatement Activity of Issuers with ICFR Opinions", "On an overall basis, the rate of restatements (figure 2) exceeds the rates of adverse ICFR opinions (figure 1) for those companies that receive ICFR opinions.", "When looking more specifically at the companies with financial restatements, the data show additional complexity.", "The vast majority of companies restating prior year financial statements received a \"clean\" audit opinion on ICFR in the year in which the restatement was announced.", "Figure 3 below shows that in 2014, more than 76 percent of such restating companies received an ICFR opinion from their auditor that their ICFR was effective in the year in which the restatement was announced.[19]", "Figure 3: ICFR Opinions of Issuers that Announced a Financial Restatement", "The data show that, often, a material weakness is not identified even when a known misstatement occurs, and suggests that there may be undisclosed material weaknesses in ICFR.[20]", "Another interesting data point is the number of clean ICFR audit opinions that are subsequently withdrawn and replaced with adverse opinions on ICFR (restating from clean opinions to adverse opinions).", "A restatement of a clean ICFR audit opinion happens when, subsequent to the issuance of the ICFR audit opinion, the following two conditions occur: (1) the auditor becomes aware that one or more material weakness existed at the report date that would have affected the auditor's opinion on ICFR had the auditor been aware of it; and (2) the previously issued ICFR audit opinion is being relied upon.", "Because the ICFR opinions are issued annually, this \"reliance period\" is generally from the date the opinion is issued until the date of the issuance of the subsequent year's ICFR audit opinion.", "Figure 4 shows that although the numbers of restated ICFR opinions are small (likely due in part to the fact that ICFR opinion restatements only occur if the erroneous opinion is still being relied upon because a subsequent year's ICFR opinion has not yet been issued), they have been increasing in number over the past few years.", "For 2013 filings, issuers filed 33 restated ICFR audit opinions, which represents a significant increase over the 22 restated ICFR audit opinions associated with 2011 filings.", "The 33 restated ICFR audit opinions are included in the total number of adverse ICFR opinions in Table 2, and are significant in relation to the totals.", "For instance, the 33 restated ICFR opinions in 2013 represent approximately 18 percent of the 186 adverse opinions initially filed for 2013.", "(See figure 1.) Notably, a number of these restated opinions arose during or after a PCAOB inspection.[21]", "Figure 4: Number of ICFR Audit Opinions Restated from \"Clean\" (effective ICFR) to \"Adverse\" (ineffective ICFR)", "Recently, SEC staff has publicly questioned \"whether all material weaknesses are being properly identified and disclosed.", "\"[22] In particular, SEC staff suggested \"that at least some of the PCAOB's inspection findings related to the audits of internal control over financial reporting are likely indicators of similar problems with management's evaluations of ICFR, and thus potentially also indicative of risk for unidentified material weaknesses.\"[23]", "Along those lines, SEC staff has expressed surprise that management rarely appears to identify a material weakness in the absence of a material misstatement.[24]", "The SEC staff have also stated that \"efforts throughout the SEC pertaining to the ICFR requirements are ongoing, coordinated, and increasingly integrated into our routine consultation, disclosure review and enforcement efforts.", "For example, informed by recent work of the SEC's Division of Corporation Finance in reviewing issuer disclosures, SEC staff has paid considerable public attention to the evaluation of control deficiencies by company management.[26]", "The recent inspection results in audits of ICFR and data relating to the issuance of clean or adverse ICFR opinions may provide opportunities for future research to explain the reasons behind the trends and the apparent contradiction between an overall increasing percentage of adverse opinions on ICFR and the overall increasing percentage of \"clean ICFR\" opinions for issuers that announce a restatement.", "The following inquiries and questions may be of interest to academic researchers.", "1. What is driving the increases in adverse audit opinions on ICFR shown in Table 1? Is there a subset of issuers with year-after-year adverse opinions driving these numbers?", "Is there a relationship between the increases in adverse ICFR opinions and PCAOB's increased focus on inspecting ICFR audits, which began in 2010?", "How does the implementation of COSO 2013 factor into the increase in adverse ICFR audit opinions? To what extent might these trends continue?", "2. Why do the vast majority of issuers with financial restatements receive a clean audit opinion on ICFR?", "Is this simply a timing issue or are there other underlying causes? Have there been undisclosed material weaknesses in this group of issuers?", "3. I've heard anecdotally that it is difficult for auditors to convince an audit client that a material weakness exists in the absence of a material misstatement.", "To what extent does this pressure exist and potentially cause underreporting of material weaknesses?", "4. What are the circumstances that lead to audit firms discovering the need to restate ICFR audit opinions from clean to adverse, and how can this information be useful in improving ICFR audits?", "5. Does the current level of management and auditor disclosure of material weaknesses reasonably reflect the state of ICFR among issuers?", "In particular, are all material weaknesses being properly identified and disclosed? Are there areas of improvement needed across the system?", "In light of the significant number of inspection findings and the increasing range of responses of audit firms to remediate deficiencies and related quality control issues, it is not surprising to hear concerns about the potential impact on audit fees.", "Some issuers may be seeing additional ICFR audit work being conducted by audit firms as a result of deficiencies identified through a PCAOB inspection of their own audits and/or as a result of systemic changes being made in response to deficiencies found in multiple ICFR audits conducted by the firm.", "Other issuers simply may not be well-prepared for their audits in that their controls are not as strong as they should be and/or those controls are not supported by strong documentation and evidence.", "These situations can also lead to more audit costs, as well as more costs to the issuers if controls need to be improved.", "At the same time, I've heard anecdotal accounts about auditors adding work that is potentially not value-added, while driving up audit fees, in response to PCAOB inspection findings.", "We've also heard that constructive and productive communication is sometimes lacking between auditors and audit clients, with the engagement teams simply telling an audit client that certain work must be done in a particular way \"because of PCAOB inspections.\"", "I believe that there probably are some cases out there where auditors are doing too much work or not the right kind of work in an attempt to respond to or avoid a PCAOB inspection finding, and that communication between the auditors and clients on these matters has not been productive.", "To the extent that this is happening, \"we\" collectively, including the firms, audit teams, issuers, and the PCAOB, need to get a handle on this, so that valuable audit resources are not being diverted from areas that are high risk.", "On the other end of the spectrum, there are a number of cases in which the auditors did not do sufficient work and got the opinion on ICFR wrong.", "As I mentioned, there have been instances where, as a result of performing more work in response to PCAOB inspection findings on ICFR, the auditors needed to issue an adverse opinion on ICFR to replace the original clean opinion.", "Then we have what I hope is a large category \"in the middle.\" These are audits in which the engagement teams perform effective and appropriately efficient audits of the issuer's ICFR, with sufficient audit work and evidence to support the opinion on ICFR.", "This is not to say that these audits will be tension-free. In my view, there should always be some level of tension in this process if it is effective.", "Such tension is a natural outgrowth of an auditor's effective application of professional skepticism and due care in questioning management's assertions and results.", "In order to determine whether any systemic trends were emerging regarding audit fees, and in particular, fees paid by issuers that received opinions on ICFR, the PCAOB's Office of Research and Analysis (ORA) performed in-depth analysis of audit fees from 2010 through 2014.", "The analysis focused on issuers with reported market capitalization greater than $0 and, separately, the subset of issuers from that group receiving ICFR audit opinions.", "Of the approximately 9,067 active issuers on December 31, 2014,[27] about 5,853 reported audit fees for both 2013 and 2014, and also reported market capitalization greater than $0.[28]", "These issuers reported paying approximately $12.1 billion in audit fees for fiscal year 2014.[29]", "In 2014, these companies reported a median change of 2.92 percent increase in audit fees over the prior year.[30] Of these companies, 36 percent reported a decrease in audit fees; 5 percent reported no change; and 59 percent reported an increase.", "These rates, both the median change and percentage breakdown of issuers, have been largely consistent over the past four years.", "Among issuers with ICFR opinions, the results are similar, with the median percentage change in audit fees being slightly higher and the proportion of issuers reporting increases also slightly higher.", "Among the 3,863 issuers that filed financial reports that contained an auditors' opinion on ICFR, 3,652 issuers also reported audit fees for both 2013 and 2014.[31] These companies reported a median change of 4.08 percent increase in audit fees over the prior year.", "Of these companies, 34 percent reported a decrease in audit fees; 2 percent reported no change; and 64 percent reported an increase.", "Similar to the larger group of issuers referred to above, these rates have been generally consistent over the past four years.", "We know that many factors influence the amount of audit fees an issuer will report for an external audit in any year, such as significant changes in the size of a company, a sizable acquisition or divestment, existing financial reporting problems, or an auditor change.", "The analysis indicates that approximately half of the issuers experienced one of these major events that could result in significant changes in audit fees.[32]", "The distribution of changes in audit fees shows that a clear majority of issuers (61 percent) with a major event reported changes in audit fees greater than +/-10 percent; while a majority of issuers (58 percent) with no major event reported changes in audit fees within the range of -10 percent to +9 percent.", "This observation was similar among the two groups of issuers when considering the presence or absence of a major event.", "The take-away from this analysis is that the audit fee data from the past four years for all issuers, including those with ICFR opinions, show relatively stable increases in the median percentage change in fees since 2011.[33]", "And when issuers do report large changes in their audit fees, it is most likely related to factors other than ICFR audit work.", "Therefore, it does not appear that there are systemic impacts on audit fees that can be attributed to recent changes in ICFR auditing that firms may have implemented in the wake of PCAOB inspection results for ICFR audits.", "Of course, there may be variations in the impact on fees charged to individual issuers with ICFR audits, depending on the facts and circumstances.", "Examples include the quality of their auditor's ICFR-related work in prior years and the timing or nature of the improvements being implemented by the issuer's firm.", "We will continue to monitor both the timing and nature of remediation activities of the firms in this important audit area, as well as the potential impact on audit effort and fees.", "In conclusion, I am pleased that there appears to be some preliminary evidence that PCAOB inspection findings related to ICFR have begun to decrease.", "This, together with what I hear from leaders in the profession, makes me optimistic that the audit work in the area of ICFR may be improving, though questions remain about whether auditors appropriately recognize and act on all material weaknesses as required by applicable standards.", "And these improvements, of course, may come at a cost. While we have not yet seen any systemic, unexpected increases in audit fees among issuers with ICFR audits, this is something we will continue to monitor.", "Ultimately, it is my hope that, as auditors become more effective at auditing the effectiveness of ICFR, they will also continue to do so efficiently and cost-effectively and possibly gain efficiencies through an appropriate risk-based focus.", "I look forward to continuing this discussion with you. I am always interested in ideas for academic research that can provide insights into these and other issues of interest to the PCAOB, to help improve audit quality and achieve the assurance that investors and our markets need on the quality of financial reporting and the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting.", "[1] On May 13, 2013, COSO released an updated version of its \"Internal Control — Integrated Framework,\" that was originally published in 1992.", "[2] Jeanette M.

One major car manufacturer, for example, structures executive bonuses so: 40% based on warranty repairs per 100 vehicles sold; 20% on customer satisfaction surveys; 20% on market share; and 20% on accounting performance (pre-tax earnings).", "However, like all subjective assessments, these methods can lead to considerable error.", "Lack of causal links is a third issue. Many companies adopt non-financial measures without articulating the relations between the measures or verifying that they have a bearing on accounting and stock price performance.", "Unknown or unverified causal links create two problems when evaluating performance: incorrect measures focus attention on the wrong objectives and improvements cannot be linked to later outcomes.", "Xerox, for example, spent millions of dollars on customer surveys, under the assumption that improvements in satisfaction translated into better financial performance.", "Later analysis found no such association. As a result, Xerox shifted to a customer loyalty measure that was found to be a leading indicator of financial performance.", "The lack of an explicit casual model of the relations between measures also contributes to difficulties in evaluating their relative importance.", "Without knowing the size and timing of associations among measures, companies find it difficult to make decisions or measure success based on them.", "Fourth on the list of problems with non-financial measures is lack of statistical reliability – whether a measure actually represents what it purports to represent, rather than random “measurement error”.", "Many non-financial data such as satisfaction measures are based on surveys with few respondents and few questions.", "These measures generally exhibit poor statistical reliability, reducing their ability to discriminate superior performance or predict future financial results.", "Finally, although financial measures are unlikely to capture fully the many dimensions of organizational performance, implementing an evaluation system with too many measures can lead to “measurement disintegration”.", "This occurs when an overabundance of measures dilutes the effect of the measurement process.

For example, many executives rate environmental performance and quality as relatively unimportant drivers of long-term financial performance.", "In contrast, statistical analyses indicate these dimensions are strongly associated with a company’s market value.", "A second method is to use standard classifications such as financial, internal business process, customer, learning and growth categories.", "While these may be appropriate, other non-financial dimensions may be more important, depending on the organization’s strategy, competitive environment and objectives.", "Moreover, these categories do little to help determine weightings for each dimension.", "Perhaps the most sophisticated method of determining value drivers is statistical analysis of the leading and lagging indicators of financial performance.", "The resulting “causal business model” can help determine which measures predict future financial performance and can assist in assigning weightings to measures based on the strength of the statistical relation.", "Unfortunately, relatively few companies develop such causal business models when selecting their performance measures.", "Most companies track hundreds, if not thousands, of non-financial measures in their day-to-day operations.", "To avoid “reinventing the wheel”, an inventory of current measures should be made. Once measures have been documented, their value for performance measurement can be assessed.", "The issue at this stage is the extent to which current measures are aligned with the company’s strategies and value drivers.", "One method for assessing this alignment is “gap analysis”. Gap analysis requires managers to rank performance measures on at least two dimensions: their importance to strategic objectives and the importance currently placed on them.", "Our survey of 148 US financial services companies — a joint research project sponsored by the Cap Gemini Ernst & Young Center for Business Innovation and the Wharton Research Program on Value Creation in Organizations – found significant “measurement gaps” for many non-financial measures.", "For example, 72% of companies said customer-related performance was an extremely important driver of long-term success, against 31% who chose short-term financial performance.", "However, the quality of short-term financial measurement is considerably better than measurement of customer satisfaction.", "Similar disparities exist for non-financial measures related to employee performance, operational results, quality, alliances, supplier relations, innovation, community and the environment.", "More important, stock market and long-term accounting performance are both higher when these measurement gaps are smaller.", "Finally, after measures are chosen, they must become an integral part of reporting and performance evaluation if they are to affect employee behavior and organizational performance.", "This is not easy. Since the choice of performance measures has a substantial impact on employees’ careers and pay, controversy is bound to emerge no matter how appropriate the measures.", "Many companies have failed to benefit from non-financial performance measures through being reluctant to take this step.", "Although non-financial measures are increasingly important in decision-making and performance evaluation, companies should not simply copy measures used by others.", "The choice of measures must be linked to factors such as corporate strategy, value drivers, organizational objectives and the competitive environment.", "In addition, companies should remember that performance measurement choice is a dynamic process – measures may be appropriate today, but the system needs to be continually reassessed as strategies and competitive environments evolve."]}

An effective DPIA allows you to identify and fix problems at an early stage, bringing broader benefits for both individuals and your organisation.", "It can reassure individuals that you are protecting their interests and have reduced any negative impact on them as much as you can.", "In some cases the consultation process for a DPIA gives them a chance to have some say in the way their information is used.", "Conducting and publishing a DPIA can also improve transparency and make it easier for individuals to understand how and why you are using their information", "In turn, this can create potential benefits for your reputation and relationships with individuals. Conducting a DPIA can help you to build trust and engagement with the people using your services, and improve your understanding of their needs, concerns and expectations.", "There can also be financial benefits.

York.22", "Several jurisdictions have joined forces with policy labs—typically housed in universities—to help them design and test the effectiveness of government programs.", "For example, the Colorado Evaluation and Action Lab is a new government-research partnership that will help state officials to evaluate public programs and policies.23", "Government leaders also partner with individual researchers, rather than a research organization, whose interests and skills align with a particular policy or program they want to evaluate.", "South Carolina’s Department of Health and Human Services, with the help of the Abdul Latif Jameel Poverty Action Lab (J-PAL), a research center at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, paired up with health-focused researchers at Northwestern University to develop a randomized evaluation of assignment to Medicaid managed care plans.24", "Policymakers should pair these research partners with trained government staff in the offices that operate (or oversee providers who operate) the programs being evaluated.", "Make better use of existing administrative data systems to reduce impact evaluation costs", "Most governments maintain reporting systems that collect administrative data, such as criminal arrest or education records, which could be used to help conduct impact evaluations at a lower cost than collecting this information from scratch.25 For example, New Mexico’s Department of Corrections conducted a quasi-experimental design (QED) study of a substance use disorder program using administrative data from three state correctional offices.", "With a small evaluation budget, the department was able to successfully answer policymakers’ questions about whether a program affected recidivism or substance use disorder relapse rates.26", "Some states, such as Washington and South Carolina, have built sophisticated data warehouses that link data across multiple agencies and can be used for performing evaluations.", "For example, the South Carolina Revenue and Fiscal Affairs Office (RFA) operates an integrated data warehouse that receives copies of agency databases used for program administration and research.27 While the originating agencies maintain control over the use of the data, the RFA provides guidance on sharing and usage agreements to help researchers access the information to evaluate programs.28 A new Pay for Success project focused on expanding an evidence-based family support and coaching program in the state will use data from the warehouse to evaluate the program’s impact and calculate its return on investment.29", "Washington state’s RDA also uses administrative data for most of its impact evaluations, which enables the agency to conduct more frequent evaluations on a wide range of programs.", "“We can knock out a quasi-experimental evaluation, assuming there’s no new data to collect, in a relatively short time and at a fraction of the cost of doing an external evaluation,” said health economist David Mancuso.30", "Both federal and private entities are creating funding opportunities to support state and local governments in using administrative data to support low-cost RCTs.", "Align data policies and funding to support evaluation", "Two key obstacles to conducting impact evaluations are accessing the data necessary for the study and finding the resources to fund it.", "Yet state and county officials have found creative ways to mitigate these seemingly formidable challenges.", "To generate new evidence on what works, researchers need access to government data, but service providers and government agencies may be hesitant to share data due to privacy issues or concerns over how the data might be used.", "Government leaders can alleviate these sensitivities and facilitate information access by developing sharing and usage agreements that outline the purpose of the data sharing, how it will be shared with the public, and privacy protections.31", "For example, the Colorado Department of Education established a data-sharing and usage agreement with Mathematica Policy Research to allow Mathematica to access the department’s administrative data to conduct an impact evaluation of a new charter school program’s effects on education achievement.32", "The agreement outlines the types of data to be shared, as well as the responsibility of the requestor to use the data only for the purposes outlined in the agreement (in other words, the impact study), to secure and later destroy the shared data, and to share analyses with the department prior to publication.", "Because of the shared data, Mathematica could perform an impact evaluation that showed state officials that taxpayer investments in the program had positive impacts on reading and math skills at the elementary, middle school, and high school grade levels.33", "States and localities can finance impact evaluations by setting aside internal funding for the studies, allowing governments to select programs in most need of an evaluation rather than being subject to the priorities of external funders.", "Results First researchers identified several ways governments are setting aside funding for rigorous evaluations, including through legislation, grants, and budget allocations.", "For example, California passed a law in 2014 that sets aside funds to award contracts to recipients who agree to partner with an independent evaluator to assess the effectiveness of programs funded through the contracts.34 Three counties received $1.25 million to $2 million in 2016 to implement and evaluate selected social services programs.35 Though the law does not require recipients to conduct an impact evaluation, Alameda County is performing an RCT of a life coaching and mentoring services program aimed at reducing recidivism and increasing employment.36", "Some state and local governments dedicate funds to support staff who oversee or conduct impact evaluations.", "Washington state’s RDA receives approximately 30 percent of its funding from a legislative appropriation that includes support for research staff who manage evaluations.37 RDA supplements this funding with federal grants, including Medicaid and a Substance Abuse and Mental Health Block Grant.", "Even when state and local governments build impact evaluation staff or set aside funds to support these studies, additional federal and private funding can help fill remaining capacity and funding gaps.", "The federal government has provided several competitive and formula grant opportunities. For example, the Institute of Education Sciences released a request for applications in 2017 for low-cost RCTs or QEDs of education interventions.38 The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services has also provided grants that included funding to evaluate child welfare and teen pregnancy interventions.39 While these opportunities provide substantial support for impact evaluations, they should not be a substitute for using existing government resources to support this work; many are one-time grants that limit support to one study, and some target programs or policies that might not be an area of need in a particular jurisdiction.", "Even jurisdictions that have never completed an impact evaluation have opportunities to start building this capacity through external sources.", "For instance, in 2016 J-PAL launched the State and Local Innovation Initiative to help jurisdictions perform randomized studies of social programs,40 with eight jurisdictions chosen to participate in the first two rounds.41 In addition to funding, each will receive technical support and custom trainings to expand the internal capacity to create, use, and share rigorous evidence.", "(See Appendix A for more information on funding opportunities.)", "While state and local governments have demonstrated the value of impact studies to assess programmatic investments, it is not practical (or even necessary) to rigorously evaluate every program.", "Decision-makers can identify and prioritize which programs to study by considering four key questions:", "- Does the program have an evidence base? To identify programs that could benefit from an impact evaluation, governments can inventory the programs they fund and determine which ones have evidence supporting their effectiveness.", "National research clearinghouses—which review and aggregate impact evaluations in order to rate programs by their level of evidence of effectiveness—can help determine if local programs have existing evidence.", "Governments can prioritize evaluations for programs that do not have strong evidence of their effectiveness.", "- Has the program been properly implemented? Poorly implemented programs are less likely to achieve the outcomes that leaders and residents expect, which would impair the results of an impact assessment.", "- Are the right data available for an impact study? To conduct an impact study, evaluators need access to the right kinds of data.", "If the data are owned by other parties (e.g., another agency or program provider) or do not exist, governments should consider the feasibility of getting the data, which could entail developing data-sharing agreements or spending additional funds and time to collect new data.", "- Does the program serve a significant number of people and/or is it a large budget item? Programs that have a higher number of clients and/or are costlier typically have a larger impact on a government’s budget than those that are less prescribed or less costly, and may be more attractive options for an impact evaluation.", "Decision-makers may find that some of their untested programs are not good candidates for an impact evaluation.", "In that case, they can take other steps to ensure these programs are generating positive results, such as tracking outcomes of participants and reviewing implementation to identify any issues with operation and delivery.", "Decisionmakers can review these programs again at a later time to determine if they have become evaluation-ready.", "Policymakers care about funding what works, and impact evaluations are an important tool that can be used to inform better, data-driven decisions.", "Impact evaluations provide critical information on program effectiveness, which policymakers can consider when making decisions about when to scale up, scale back, or make adjustments to a particular program or initiative.", "By building their jurisdiction’s capacity to evaluate untested programs, policymakers can hold themselves accountable to the public, and ensure that the state’s public dollars are directed to those programs that yield positive results.", "While challenges still exist for governments seeking to regularly evaluate their programs, new technology and opportunities to leverage impact evaluation expertise through partnerships or grants have made it more feasible than ever for state and local governments to conduct rigorous evaluations of local programs.", "By carefully prioritizing which programs are ripe for impact evaluations, governments can make the most of their resources and fill in gaps about which programs are working and which are not.", "- Actionable Intelligence for Social Policy’s Technical Assistance and Training Program, https://www.aisp.upenn.edu/resources/training-technical-assistance/", "- American Evaluation Association, Find an Evaluator, http://www.eval.org/p/cm/ld/fid=108", "- Kathryn E.

But the promise of research that can help us do more good per dollar spent is enticing.", "Yet here’s one cautionary claim we can make for certain: Every dollar spent on poorly conceived research that does not help tomorrow’s children is a dollar wasted.", "Good impact evaluations—those that answer policy-relevant questions with rigor—have improved development knowledge, policy, and practice.", "For example, the NGO Living Goods conducted a rigorous evaluation to measure the impact of its community health model based on door-to-door sales and promotions.", "The evidence of impact was strong: Their model generated a 27-percent reduction in child mortality. This evidence subsequently persuaded policy makers, replication partners, and major funders to support the rapid expansion of Living Goods’ reach to five million people.", "Meanwhile, rigorous evidence continues to further validate the model and help to make it work even better.", "Of course, not all rigorous research offers such quick and rosy results. Consider the many studies required to discover a successful drug and the lengthy process of seeking regulatory approval and adoption by the healthcare system.", "The same holds true for fighting poverty: Innovations for Poverty Action (IPA), a research and policy nonprofit that promotes impact evaluations for finding solutions to global poverty, has conducted more than 650 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) since its inception in 2002.", "These studies have sometimes provided evidence about how best to use scarce resources (e.g., give away bed nets for free to fight malaria), as well as how to avoid wasting them (e.g., don’t expand traditional microcredit).", "But the vast majority of studies did not paint a clear picture that led to immediate policy changes. Developing an evidence base is more like building a mosaic: Each individual piece does not make the picture, but bit by bit a picture becomes clearer and clearer.", "How do these investments in evidence pay off? IPA estimated the benefits of its research by looking at its return on investment—the ratio of the benefit from the scale-up of the demonstrated large-scale successes divided by the total costs since IPA’s founding.", "The ratio was 74x—a huge result. But this is far from a precise measure of impact, since IPA cannot establish what would have happened had IPA never existed.", "(Yes, IPA recognizes the irony of advocating for RCTs while being unable to subject its own operations to that standard.", "Yet IPA’s approach is intellectually consistent: Many questions and circumstances do not call for RCTs.)", "Even so, a simple thought exercise helps to demonstrate the potential payoff.

Impact is more than a buzzword.", "Impact implies causality; it tells us how a program or organization has changed the world around it. Implicitly this means that one must estimate what would have occurred in the absence of the program—what evaluators call “the counterfactual.”", "The term sounds technocratic, but it matters a great deal in assessing how best to spend limited resources to help individuals and communities.", "When feasible, the most straightforward way to create a counterfactual is through a randomized controlled trial (RCT) in which participation in a program, or in some aspect of a program, is decided partly through random allocation.", "Without a counterfactual, we do not know whether the program caused a change to happen or whether some outside factor—such as weather, economic growth, or other government policy—triggered the change.", "We can’t know whether those who participated in a program changed their lives because of the program or because of other factors.", "A rigorous counterfactual can change conventional but misplaced beliefs: For example, recent counterfactual-based impact evaluations of microcredit programs found much lower impact on household income than was previously claimed by microcredit advocates.", "Good monitoring data are often collateral damage in the pursuit of measuring impact. Information on what the staff is doing, take-up and usage of program services, and what constituents think of operations can help create a better program and stronger organization.", "These data often get lost or overshadowed in the pursuit of impact evaluations. This is partly understandable: impact is the ultimate goal, and sloppy thinking often conflates management data with impact data.", "(Take-up of a product like microcredit, for example, is an important piece of management data but is not a measure of impact; statements such as “50,000 clients served” do not measure impact.)", "The challenge for organizations is to build and use data collection strategies and systems that accurately report impact when possible, demonstrate accountability, and provide decision makers with timely and actionable operational data.", "The challenge for funders and other nonprofit stakeholders is to ask organizations to be accountable for developing these right-fit evidence systems and to demand impact evaluation only when the time is right.", "In what follows, we offer 10 reasons for not measuring impact. We then provide a framework for right-fit monitoring and evaluation systems that help organizations stay consistently and appropriately attuned to the data needed for accountability, learning, and improvement.", "The 10 reasons not to measure impact fall into four categories: Not the Right Tool, Not Now, Not Feasible, and Not Worth It.", "For each reason, we also offer alternatives that fans of impact evaluation can adopt instead.", "1. Not the Right Tool: Excellent question, wrong approach. Here are some excellent questions you may ask in evaluating a program: What is the story behind a successful or unsuccessful program recipient?", "Can we deliver the same services for less by improving our operating model? Are we targeting the people we said we would target?", "Are our constituents satisfied with the service we provide? Is there significant demand for the service we provide?", "Is the demand sustained—do people come back for more? Is the problem we are solving the most pressing in our context?", "We could go on. These are the questions that key stakeholders often want answered. Some of these questions can be answered with data.", "Others are tougher to tackle. But—and this is the crucial point—their answers are not measures of impact.", "Alternative: To answer these questions, data collection and analysis need to focus more precisely on the question being asked.", "Understanding constituent satisfaction requires feedback data. Improving the cost-effectiveness of program delivery requires detailed data on costs by site, as well as by product or service.", "All of this is important program monitoring data to collect, but none of it requires an impact evaluation.", "2. Not Now: The program design is not ready. Thinking through the theory of change is the first step to planning out a monitoring or evaluation strategy.", "A theory of change articulates what goes into a program, what gets done, and how the world is expected to change as a result.", "Without it, staff may hold conflicting or muddled ideas about how or why a program works, which can result in large variations in implementation.", "Articulating a clear theory of change is not merely an academic exercise for retreats and donors. A theory of change guides right-fit data collection by making clear what data to track to make sure an organization is doing what it says it does, to provide feedback and engagement data to guide program learning and improvement (neither of which requires a counterfactual), and to provide guidance for key outcomes to track in an impact assessment (which does require a counterfactual to be meaningful).", "An untested theory of change likely contains mistaken assumptions. For example, hypothesized connections (“theory”) between program elements may not hold.", "Assumptions may also be wrong empirically: Program outcomes may depend on everyone finishing the training part of the program.", "Do they? Good management data could help demonstrate this. Similarly, programs may assume that demand exists for their services (e.g., microcredit), but a good needs assessment might show that reasonable credit alternatives exist.", "Large impact evaluations undertaken before key assumptions in the theory of change undergo examination are likely to be misguided and ultimately lead to conflict over interpretation.", "If the program is found not to work, implementers are likely to reject the results, arguing that the program evaluation doesn’t reflect current implementation.", "Alternative: Validating the initial steps in the theory of change is a critical step before moving on to measuring impact.", "Consider a program to deliver child development, health, and nutrition information to expectant mothers in order to improve prenatal care and early childhood outcomes.", "Starting an impact evaluation before knowing if expectant mothers will actually attend the training and adopt the practices makes little sense.", "First establish that there is a basic take-up of the program and that some immediate behaviors are being adopted.", "Before starting an impact evaluation of a program providing savings accounts, determine whether people will actually open a savings account when offered, and that they subsequently put money into the account.", "If not, the savings account design should be reconsidered.", "If the theory of change has not been fully developed, then the obvious step is to develop the theory for the program, following the implementation step by step, examining the assumptions being made, and gathering data to test them.", "Then gather monitoring data on implementation and uptake before proceeding to an impact evaluation.

For how long and how intensively do they use the product or service?", "Based on this information, how can the program be improved?", "When the program is still being adapted and implementation kinks worked out, it is probably too early to evaluate the program’s impact.", "This is a tricky situation. We could craft some general principles for determining when a program is “ready” for evaluation, such as “Basic levels of demand are observed for the program,” or “Constituents provide positive feedback.”", "The challenge is then applying these principles to specific situations. Here reasonable people will no doubt disagree, and these principles cannot clearly resolve what to do for any given situation.", "The most sensible solution is to wait and let the program work out the implementation kinks. If women are not coming to the training or teachers are not following a new curriculum, wait, watch, try new tactics or incentives; and in the meantime, collect good monitoring data that informs progress.", "3. Not Now: The program implementation is not ready. Even if a program’s theory has been fully defined and basic assumptions tested, implementation may falter.", "An evaluation that finds no impact for a project with weak implementation is hard to interpret. Is the finding the result of poor implementation, the wrong partner, or outside circumstances (e.g., civil unrest or other disturbances)?", "Either way, when implementation is weak, impact evaluation is a bad choice.", "To return to our previous example, a prenatal training program may have determined that mothers demand these services and will show up and complete the training in an “ideal” setting where the program was tested.", "But what if during program rollout the trainings are not implemented as planned? What if not all mothers complete the training?", "Basic implementation information is needed before moving to impact evaluation, so that stakeholders are satisfied that the program as designed is (roughly) the same as the program that is implemented.", "Alternative: Collect good monitoring data and use it to strengthen implementation. Evaluators can either work with program leadership to improve implementation or decide that a certain organization is not a good fit for an impact evaluation.", "But what if the real world takes over and politics (or funding) mean you must evaluate now or never? If the program is still not ready, consider again carefully whether impact evaluation is the right step.", "Will the evaluation help answer theory-based questions under real-world implementation conditions? Will an evaluation now make an innovative or controversial program more likely to be accepted by constituents?", "Are the technical issues discussed below addressed, and can you construct a reliable comparison group?", "If you answer no to any of these questions, impact evaluation isn’t the right step. But if you answer yes to all, an evaluation of a program that isn’t quite ready can still inform important and timely policy-relevant decisions, especially if the evaluators work closely with the policy makers throughout the evaluation process.", "4. Not Now: It is too late. The desire for impact measurement often comes after a program has already expanded and has no plans for further expansion.", "In these cases, it may be too late. Once a program has begun implementation, it is too late randomly to assign individuals or households or communities to treatment and control.", "Creating a non-randomized comparison group may be viable but is often hard to do and quite expensive.", "And the true comparability of this group may still be in question, thus rendering the evaluation less convincing.", "Alternative: Plan for future expansions.

Not Feasible: Resources are too limited. Resource limitations can doom the potential for impact evaluation in two ways: The program scale may be too small, or resources may be too scarce to engage in high-quality measurement.", "If a program is small, there simply will not be enough data to detect impact unless the impact is massive.", "Without sounding too sour, few initiatives have truly massive impact. And an impact evaluation with an ambiguous conclusion is worse than doing nothing at all.", "A lot of money is spent to learn absolutely nothing—money that could have been spent to help more people.", "Similarly, if there is not enough money to do a good evaluation, consider not doing it at all. You may be forced to have too small a sample, cut too many corners on what you are measuring, or risk poor implementation of evaluation protocols.", "Alternative: If your scale is limited, do not try to force an answer to the impact question. Consider other options.", "First, perhaps much is already known about the question at hand. What do other evaluations say about it?", "How applicable is the context under which those studies were done, and how similar is the intervention?", "Study the literature to see if there is anything that suggests your approach might be effective. If no other evaluations provide helpful insights, track implementation, get regular feedback, and collect other management data that you can use instead.", "If money is limited, consider what is driving the cost of your evaluation. Data (especially household surveys) are a key cost driver for an evaluation.", "The randomization part of a randomized trial is virtually costless. Can you answer key impact questions with cheaper data, perhaps with administrative data?", "For example, if testing the impact of a savings program, no doubt many will want to know the impact on health and education spending, agricultural and enterprise investment, consumption of temptation goods, and so forth.", "But in many cases, just seeing increased savings in regulated financial institutions indicates some success.", "If that alternative is not viable or satisfactory, then focus on tracking implementation and collecting other management data that you can put to use.", "Alternatively, of course, you can raise more money. If the knowledge gap on your issue is big enough—you have a widely implemented program that hasn’t been tested, for example, or you’re trying a new approach in a conflict setting—then funders may be interested in knowing the answer, too.", "6. Not Feasible: Indirect effects are difficult to identify, yet critical to the theory of change. Many programs include indirect effects that are critical to their theory of change.", "A farming-information intervention, for example, teaches some farmers new techniques and hopes that they share this information with their neighbors and extended family.", "A health intervention protects individuals from an infectious disease and anticipates that those who come into contact with the treated individuals are also helped, because they will also not contract the disease.", "In these cases, a simple question ought to be asked: Does one reasonably believe (and ideally have some evidence from elsewhere) that the indirect effects are significant enough that ignoring them may radically alter the policy implication of the results?", "If so, then ignoring them could lead to a deeply flawed study—one that should not be done at all.", "Measuring such indirect effects correctly is critical to understanding a program’s true impact. Take the example of deworming school children.", "Prior to Edward Miguel and Michael Kremer’s 2004 study of deworming in Econometrica, studies that tested the impact of school-based deworming typically randomized within schools, with some children receiving deworming pills and others not.", "Program effects were evaluated by comparing children who received treatment with those who did not. Yet there was good reason to believe that there were indirect effects across children within the same schools—children playing barefoot in the same schoolyard pass infection from one to the other.", "So within any given school, the control group also got partially treated. Imagine that this indirect effect is big—so big that it is the same size as the direct effect.", "Even if treatment had huge effects on health or schooling outcomes, comparing treated and untreated children would lead to the conclusion that deworming has no effect at all.", "Miguel and Kremer’s deworming study explicitly measured these indirect effects. Doing so fundamentally changed the cost-benefit calculation of deworming: With indirect effects included, the benefits of deworming turned out to be quite large.", "Alternative: Measuring indirect effects can be a feature of a good impact evaluation, rather than an obstacle.", "Of course, if indirect effects are ignored, then the presence of such issues can introduce bias, and thus incorrect conclusions.", "In considering the response to indirect effects, a first tack is to review existing studies and theory to predict how important these issues are.", "If they are significant, and therefore important to measure, then there are two potential approaches to take: First, indirect effects can be included in the experimental design—for example, by creating two control groups: one that is exposed indirectly to treatment and the other that is not.", "Second, data can be collected on indirect effects. Ask participants who they talk to, and measure social networks so that the path of indirect effects can be estimated.", "If indirect effects can’t be accurately estimated, however, and they are likely to be large, then impact evaluation is not a good choice.", "Resources will be wasted if true impact is masked by indirect effects.", "7. Not Feasible: Program setting is too chaotic. Some situations are not amenable to impact evaluation.", "Many disaster-relief situations, for example, would be difficult, if not impossible, to evaluate, since implementation is constantly shifting to adapt to evolving circumstances.", "Maintaining strict experimental protocols could be costly, compromising the quality of the implementation.", "Even if not costly in theory, such protocols are unlikely to be adhered to in a rapidly changing environment and could prevent assistance from going to those who need it most.", "Alternative: Track implementation activities and collect other management data that you can use to strengthen the program.", "Consider also whether there are operational questions that could generate useful learning. Operational (sometimes called rapid-cycle or rapid-fire or A/B) experiments can help improve implementation: Will sending a text message to remind someone to do something influence short-run behavior?", "How frequently should that text message be sent, at what time of day, and what exactly should it say?", "Is transferring funds via cash or mobile money more effective for getting money to those affected? How will lump-sum versus spread-out transfers influence short-run investment choices?", "Such short-run operational questions may be amenable to evaluation.", "8. Not Feasible: Implementation happens at too high a level. Consider monetary or trade policy. Such reforms typically occur for an entire country.", "Randomizing policy at the country level would be infeasible and ridiculous. Policies implemented at lower levels—say counties or cities—might work for randomization if there are a sufficient number of cities and spillover effects are not a big issue.", "Similarly, advocacy campaigns are often targeted at a high level (countries, provinces, or regions) and may not be easily amenable to impact evaluation.", "Alternative: A clear theory of intended policy change is critical. Then track implementation, feedback, and management data on whether the changes implied by theory are occurring as expected.", "9. Not Worth It: We already know the answer. In some cases, the answer about whether a program works might already be known from another study, or set of studies.", "In that case, little will be learned from another impact evaluation. But sometimes donors or boards push for this unnecessary work to check their investments.", "And organizations may not be sure if the existing evidence is sufficient, leading them to invest in unnecessary impact evaluations “just to be sure.”", "Alternative: Resist demands for impact measurement and find good arguments for why available evidence applies to your work.", "In “The Generalizability Puzzle,” their Summer 2017 article for Stanford Social Innovation Review, Mary Ann Bates and Rachel Glennerster provide some guidance.", "In short, two main conditions are key to assessing the applicability of existing studies. First, the theory behind the evaluated program must be similar to your program—in other words, the program relies on the same individual, biological, or social mechanism.", "Second, the contextual features that matter for the program should be relatively clear and similar to the context of your work.", "We also suggest that donors consider the more critical issue for scaling up effective solutions: implementation.", "Use monitoring tools to ask: Does the implementation follow what is known about the program model? Again, track the activities and feedback to know whether the implementation adheres to the evidence from elsewhere.", "A good example of this is the Catch Up program in Zambia, where the Ministry of General Education is scaling up the proven Teaching at the Right Level (TaRL) approach pioneered by the Indian NGO Pratham.", "With support from IPA and the Abdul Latif Jameel Poverty Action Lab (J-PAL), teams in Zambia are taking the TaRL program, mapping evidence to the Zambian context, supporting pilot implementation, and monitoring and assessing viability for scale-up.", "10. Not Worth It: No generalized knowledge gain. An impact evaluation should help determine why something works, not merely whether it works.", "Impact evaluations should not be undertaken if they will provide no generalizable knowledge on the “why” question— that is, if they are useful only to the implementing organization and only for that given implementation.", "This rule applies to programs with little possibility of scale, perhaps because the beneficiaries of a particular program are highly specialized or unusual, or because the program is rare and unlikely to be replicated or scaled.", "If evaluations have only a one-shot use, they are almost always not worth the cost.", "Alternative: If a program is unlikely to run again or has little potential for scale-up or replication, the best course of action is to measure implementation to make sure the program is running as intended.", "If some idea about the “why” is needed, a clear program theory and good implementation data (including data on early outcomes) can also help shed light on why something works.", "But an investment in measuring impact in this situation is misplaced.", "As should now be clear, the allure of measuring impact distracts from the more prosaic but crucial tasks of monitoring implementation and improving programs.", "Even the best idea will not have an impact if implemented poorly.

Reliability requires consistency; the data collection procedure should capture data in a consistent way.", "An unreliable scale produces a different weight every time one steps on it; a reliable one does not.", "The final component of the credible principle is appropriate analysis.

Costs to respondents—those providing the data—are significant but often overlooked.", "Responsible data collection also requires minimizing risks to these constituents through transparent processes, protection of individuals’ sensitive information, and proper research protocols.", "While collecting data has real costs, the benefits must also be considered. We incur a large social cost by collecting too little data.", "A lack of data about program implementation could hide flaws that are weakening a program. And without the ability to identify a problem in the first place, it cannot be fixed.", "Too little data can also lead to inefficient programs persisting, and thus money wasted.

Two of these—financial and activity (implementation) tracking—are already collected by many organizations to help them demonstrate accountability by tracking program implementation and its costs.", "The other three—targeting, engagement, and feedback—are less commonly collected but are critical for program improvement.", "The key to right-sized monitoring data is finding a balance between external accountability requirements and internal management needs.", "Consider financial data first. External accountability requirements often focus on revenues and expenses at the administrative and programmatic levels.", "To move beyond accountability to learning, organizations need to connect cost and revenue data directly to ongoing operations.", "This way they can assess the relative costs of services across programs and program sites.", "Many organizations also collect monitoring data about program implementation, including outputs delivered (e.g., trainings completed).", "But such data are not clearly connected to a decision-making system based on a clear theory for the program.", "A clear and detailed theory of change supports organizations in pinpointing the key outputs of each program activity so that they can develop credible measures for them.", "Targeting data answer the question: Who is actually participating in the program?

It is possible that LAG-3 expression on iNKT cells directly regulates IL-10 production, but perhaps more likely that the relationship with IL-10 reflects cross-talk between iNKT cells and other IL-10-producing lymphocyte subsets such as Tregs or neutrophils, both of which can interact with iNKTs", "[67,68]. Given that IL-10 can correlate with viral load [69], it is also possible that this relationship reflects a dependence of LAG-3 expression on disease progression, although that seems less likely given the lack of correlation between LAG-3 and CD4 count in this cohort.", "Unlike Tim-3 [70], LAG-3 was not highly expressed on any NK cell subset. The differences in LAG-3 expression between NK subsets, however, warrant further investigation.", "Although LAG-3 expression was not elevated on CD56-CD16+ NK cells among HIV+ participants, its expression was highest on this subset among healthy controls.", "The expansion of this subset during HIV infection has been documented [71], and LAG-3 could contribute to the anergic phenotype observed among these cells.", "In contrast to the T cell, and to some extent NK cell, subsets, LAG-3 was expressed at moderate levels on iNKT cells, particularly among the HIV-infected participants.", "In some patients, up to 40% of the iNKT population was LAG-3+, raising the possibility that iNKT cell function may be regulated by LAG-3 to a greater extent than other lymphocyte populations.", "iNKT cells express surface markers characteristic of both T and NK cells and respond to lipid antigen presentation by CD1d.", "Despite the low frequency of the iNKT population in the periphery (0.01 – 1% of CD3+ lymphocytes in humans), iNKT activity is now appreciated to play an important role in immunity to infectious diseases [72].", "During chronic HIV infection, the CD4+ iNKT subset is depleted [28,29], as observed in our present cohort.", "While some cohorts report full recovery of both CD4+ and CD4- iNKT subsets following ART [31], others report no effect of therapy", "[28,30] similar to the lack of CD4+ iNKT reconstitution seen during this study.", "Surprisingly, the increase in LAG-3 expression did not correspond to increased PD-1 expression, in contrast to another report by Moll et al.", "[30]. In both cohorts, iNKT PD-1 expression was several-fold higher than T cell PD-1 expression, but PD-1 was more readily detected on both cell subsets in our cohort.", "Differences in cohort ethnicity could contribute to the contrasting observations, but it is also plausible that the use of the EH12.2H7 anti-PD-1 clone coupled to the extremely bright Brilliant Violet 421 fluorochrome enabled more sensitive detection of PD-1 expression in this study than other clones and fluorochromes.", "To determine the impact of iNKT LAG-3 expression, we assessed functional iNKT cytokine production capacity in the Majengo cohort.", "Studies of iNKT function during HIV infection and treatment in the literature suffer from lack of replication in multiple cohorts, and the only functional study performed in an African cohort reported only PMA/Io-stimulated cytokine production from ART-naïve subjects [33].", "The decrease in αGalCer-induced IFNγ expression is similar to other cohorts, but the lack of functional reconstitution among ART experienced participants in this cohort is concerning [30,34].", "Data on iNKT recovery during ART is inconsistent, as some studies suggest an improvement of iNKT cytokine production following ART", "[32,73], while other studies have failed to find ART-based improvement of iNKT function [30], or have not differentiated between treated and untreated subjects [34].", "In this study, the ex vivo expression of LAG-3 on the iNKT subset inversely correlated with IFNγ secretion as measured by ICS following αGalCer stimulation.", "The consistent relationship between LAG-3 expression and IFNγ secretion for both CD4+ and CD4- iNKTs suggests a similar consequence of LAG-3 expression on both subsets, despite differences in IFNγ production between subsets in healthy individuals.", "The inhibitory activity of LAG-3 on iNKT IFNg expression was further confirmed by the demonstration that LAG-3+ iNKTs are highly unlikely to produce IFNγ following PMA/Io stimulation.", "The association of LAG-3, but not PD-1, with iNKT dysfunction during HIV infection is broadly consistent with a previous study of iNKT PD-1 expression [30].", "Although PD-1 expression was elevated among HIV-infected subjects in that cohort, its expression did not correlate with cytokine production or proliferation, and blocking of the PD-1/PD-L1 pathway did not improve proliferation or IFNγ secretion.", "To date, the contribution of other exhaustion markers (Tim-3, CD160, 2B4) to iNKT function during HIV infection has not been defined.", "The contribution of Tim-3 to iNKT inhibition during herpes simplex virus infection was assessed, but found to be not responsible for the defects in cytokine secretion [74].", "The only surface marker previously demonstrated to inversely correlate with iNKT cytokine production during HIV infection is the costimulatory molecule CD161 [34].", "CD161 is expressed by a variable, but generally high, proportion of iNKT cells [34,75,76]. The regulatory nature of CD161 on iNKT cells has not been fully clarified, as CD161+ iNKT cells are more likely to produce IFNγ and TNFα than CD161- cells in healthy individuals [76,77].", "Our study, however, did not assess CD161 expression and therefore cannot confirm or rule out a contribution of CD161 upregulation to iNKT dysfunction.", "To complement the ICS data, we also assessed cytokine/chemokine expression in cell culture supernatant after 5 days of αGalCer stimulation.", "In this assay, the background subtracted supernatant protein levels represent both iNKT cytokine expression and protein expression by other cell subsets in response to iNKT activation.", "As such, this data represents the downstream, cumulative impact of lipid stimulation/iNKT activation in a mixed culture.", "Give that iNKT activation is known to regulate a large number of other cell types, and that the functional impact of LAG-3 expression (which binds MHCII proteins) can only be truly assessed when MHCII-expressing cells are present, measuring cytokines in a whole PBMC culture may be more relevant than sorting and isolating iNKT cells.", "The correlation between iNKT frequency and analyte concentration strongly suggests that the measured analyte levels are iNKT-induced.", "Overall, several patterns emerged from analysis of cytokine/chemokine expression levels and correlations.", "Among HIV-N participants, IFNγ and IL-13 were the major cytokines produced in culture after IP-10. IFN-γ is a hallmark cytokine produced upon αGalCer stimulation, and IL-13 is produced by activated iNKT cells and directs monocyte to DC differentiation", "[78]. The loss of IL-13 secretion among HIV+ participants likely reflects, at least partially, the depletion of the CD4+ iNKT subset, which is reportedly the sole iNKT subset to produce IL-13 [64,79].", "In contrast, cytokine production among HIV+ ART naïve participants was mostly limited to IP-10 and MIP-1α/β production.", "The ART experienced group never produced significantly higher levels of any analyte compared the ART naïve group, and showed little evidence of iNKT reconstitution.", "These data suggest that in addition to a lack of reconstitution of iNKT function among ART experienced patients, the cytokine production profile is altered in comparison to both HIV-N and ART-naïve subjects.", "The correlations between sLAG-3 production and cytokine/chemokine concentrations among all study groups suggest that sLAG-3 may simply be a marker of iNKT activation.", "There is no evidence that increasing concentrations of sLAG-3 in culture results in inhibition of cytokine production.", "The lack of production of sLAG-3 in HIV+ ART naïve, but not ART-treated, participants is distinct compared to other cytokine/chemokine responses, which were generally absent in the ART treated group.", "The production of sLAG-3 by iNKT cells following stimulation has not been described in the literature, and represents a significant gap in knowledge.", "The correlation between LAG-3 expression and supernatant IFNγ at 5 days post-stimulation is consistent with the ICS results described above.", "It is important to note, however, that changes in LAG-3 expression during culture, and the contribution of other PBMC cell subsets to cytokine production make a direct link between LAG-3 expression and long-term cytokine production difficult.", "The positive correlations between PD-1 expression and cytokine production also suggest that PD-1 may indicate a more activated, rather than exhausted, iNKT phenotype.", "In conclusion, we have demonstrated both short-term and long-term defects in iNKT cytokine/chemokine expression in response to lipid stimulation in a Kenyan cohort of HIV+ ART naïve and experienced women.", "Although PD-1 expression did not appear to mediate iNKT dysfunction, the elevated expression of LAG-3 was associated with an inhibition of IFNγ production, suggesting that LAG-3 at least partially regulates iNKT function during chronic infection.", "Coupled with previous observations from our lab, and others, that LAG-3 is poorly expressed on T cells during HIV infection, blockade of LAG-3 signaling may selectively restore innate immune function and, therefore, improve current treatment regimens.", "Overall, our data suggest that LAG-3 is unlikely to play a significant role in T cell immune exhaustion in an African population.", "Unexpectedly, LAG-3 upregulation during chronic HIV infection and treatment may be restricted to the iNKT innate lymphocyte subset.", "The maintenance of LAG-3 expression during ART suggests that it may contribute to the innate immune dysregulation observed among ART subjects, as well as contributing to the loss of iNKT cytokine production observed during chronic infection.", "Future studies that demonstrate the cell-intrinsic activity of LAG-3 expression will determine whether blocking LAG-3 activity could improve innate immune responses initiated by iNKT cells during HIV infection or treatment.", "This study recruited 10 HIV-uninfected, 40 HIV-infected antiretroviral naïve and 40 HIV-infected antiretroviral experienced patients from the Majengo commercial sex worker cohort located in Nairobi, Kenya.", "In a follow-up study, an additional 16 HIV-N, 9 HIV+ and 17 HIV+ ART participants were recruited.

Participants responding “never” were exempted to complete the rest of the questionnaire.", "Participants were also asked whether having to think about what they have to cook is a constraint for them.", "The responses were rated on a 5-point Likert scale ranging from one (strongly disagree) to five (strongly agree).", "Participants were then asked whether they planned meals, even in an irregular manner (yes I do, yes I did but not anymore, no I never planned meals).", "The definition of “planning meals” given to the participants was “to plan ahead the foods that will be eaten for the next few days”.", "Participants who reported planning meal currently were considered as “meal planners” whereas others were categorized as “non-meal planners”.", "Finally, the questionnaire included questions about meal planning frequency (several times a week, once a week, once every two weeks, two to three times a month, not regularly), duration (a few days, one week, two weeks or more), period of the week (weekdays, weekend, weekdays and weekend) and sources of inspiration (personal recipe repertoire, Internet or apps, ingredients available during grocery shopping).", "At baseline and annually thereafter, participants in the NutriNet-Santé study are asked to provide socio-demographic data, including sex, age (18–30, 30–50, 50–65, >65 years), educational level (up to secondary, some college or university degree), monthly income (<1,200 €, 1,200–1,800 €, 1,800–2,700 € and >2,700 € per consumption unit), presence of children in the household (yes, no), history of dieting to lose weight during the past year (yes, no) and physical activity (low, moderate, high).", "Monthly household income is calculated per “consumption unit” (CU), where one CU is attributed for the first adult in the household, 0.5 CU for other persons aged 14 or older, and 0.3 CU for children under 14, following national statistics methodology and guidelines [39].", "Physical activity was assessed using a short form of the French version of the International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ).", "The weekly energy expenditure expressed in metabolic equivalent task minutes per week was estimated, and three scores of physical activity were constituted [i.e., low (<30 min/day), moderate (30–59 min/day), and high (≥60 min/day)]", "according to the French guidelines for physical activity [40].", "For the present study, we used the closest available data with respect to the assessment of meal planning practices.", "At inclusion and once a year thereafter, participants are invited to complete three non-consecutive 24-h dietary records, randomly assigned over a 2-week period (two weekdays and one weekend day).", "For the present analysis, we selected participants who completed at least three 24-h dietary records since their inclusion in the cohort study (i.e. completed between May 2009 and December 2014).", "Participants reported all foods and beverages consumed at each eating occasion. They estimated the amounts eaten using validated photographs of portion sizes [41], using household measures or by indicating the exact quantity (grams) or volume (milliliters).", "Daily mean food intakes were calculated, weighted for the type of day of the week. Energy, nutrient and food group intakes were estimated using the NutriNet-Santé composition table including more than 2000 foods [42].", "Dietary underreporting was identified on the basis of the method proposed by Black [43]. We hypothesize that meal planning encourages food preparation and therefore considered food groups that can be used in food preparation (e.g. eggs).", "In addition, we considered food groups that have nutritional interest (e.g. fruits). Thus, the following food groups were included in the study: fruits, vegetables, fish (including seafood and processed seafood), meat (including cooked ham, offal), eggs, milk, cheese, added fats (including oil, butter, margarine, vinaigrette), sugary products (e.g. cake, biscuits, sugars, honey, jam, chocolate) and starchy foods (including potato, legumes, pasta, rice, other cereals) with a specific focus on legumes and whole grain starchy foods (including whole grain pasta, rice, other cereals).", "Adherence to nutritional guidelines was assessed using the PNNS Guideline Score (PNNS-GS). The 15-point PNNS-GS is a validated a priori score reflecting the adherence to the official French nutritional guidelines which has been extensively described elsewhere [44].", "Details on computation of this score are in Additional file 1. Briefly, it includes 13 components: eight refer to food-serving recommendations (fruit and vegetables; starchy foods; whole grain products; dairy products; meat, eggs and fish; fish and seafood; vegetable fat; water vs. soda), four refer to moderation in consumption (added fat; salt; sweets; alcohol) and one component pertains to physical activity [44, 45].", "Points are deducted for overconsumption of salt (>12 g/day), added sugars (>17.5% of energy intake), or when energy intake exceeds the needed energy level by more than 5%.", "Each component cut-off was that of the threshold defined by the PNNS public health objectives when available [45] otherwise they were established according to the French Recommended Dietary Allowances [46].", "For the present analysis, we consider the mPNNS-GS, a modified version of the PNNS-GS, which takes into account only the dietary components, therefore excluding the physical activity component.", "Food variety has been defined as the number of different food items reported to be eaten over a given reference period [47].", "Considering that seasonality is likely to influence food variety and that a period of 10 to 15 days has been recommended to accurately assess food variety [48], the food variety was evaluated using a Food Frequency Questionnaire (FFQ).", "Sixteen months after baseline, participants were invited to complete a self-administrated 240-items FFQ to assess their usual dietary intake over the past year [49].", "Participants were asked to report their consumption frequency on the basis of how many times they ate the standard portion size proposed (typical household measurements such as spoon or standard unit such as a yogurt).", "The frequency of consumption referred to usual consumption over the past year on an increasing scale including yearly, monthly, weekly or daily units, as suitable, and participants were asked to provide only one answer.", "The food variety score corresponded to the number of FFQ items reported to be consumed at least once during the last year [47].", "The maximum score was therefore 240. Fruit and vegetable variety scores were also computed based on the number of different fruits and vegetables reported by the participants.", "Height and weight were assessed by using an anthropometric questionnaire, which was self-administered online, at baseline and each year thereafter [50, 51].", "For each participant, the closest available data to the meal planning questionnaire were used for the analysis.", "Data were not collected for pregnant women. BMI (in kg/m2) was calculated as the ratio of weight to squared height.", "Participants were classified as underweight or normal weight (BMI < 25), overweight (25 ≤ BMI < 30) and obesity (BMI ≥ 30) according to WHO references values [52].", "The analysis focused on participants who had completed the meal planning questionnaire, had declared being involved in meal preparation in their household, and who had completed at least three 24-h dietary records since they were included in the study, as well as the FFQ.", "Chi-square tests and Student’s t tests were used to compare characteristics of included vs. excluded participants, as well as meal planners vs. non-meal planners.", "Meal planners’ practices were also described. Continuous variables are presented as means ± SDs and categorical variables as percentages.", "ANCOVAs were performed to investigate the relationship between meal planning and energy, macronutrients and food groups.", "However, for some particular food groups which did not exhibit normal distribution (i.e. eggs, milk, legumes, and whole grain starchy foods), mainly due to a high proportion of non-consumers, a binary variable (consumer/non-consumer) was created and a logistic regression analysis was performed.", "Logistic regression models were also used to assess the associations between meal planning and quartiles of mPNNS-GS, as well as quartiles of food variety scores (overall, fruit and vegetable) and BMI categories.", "Due to significant interactions and differences on the associations with meal planning, analyses on BMI were performed separately by sex.", "Meal planning has been described as a cooking skill [53]. Thus, characteristics that have been shown to influence cooking practices, dietary intakes or weight status were considered as confounders in the present analyses.", "Models were therefore all adjusted for sex [1, 54, 55], age [56], educational level, monthly income [6], presence of children in the household [6], history of dieting to lose weight during the past year [57], physical activity [58], and cooking frequency.", "Models evaluating the associations with mPNNS-GS, macronutrient and food groups intakes were further adjusted for daily energy intake and number of 24-h dietary records completed by participants.", "The energy model was only adjusted on the number of 24-h records while the food variety models were adjusted on daily energy intake.", "Missing covariate data were imputed using multiple imputation method.", "Sensitivity analyses were conducted on a subsample of individuals having responded to at least one of the dietary assessments (i.e. FFQ, dietary records).", "In addition, analyses were conducted using another definition of food variety score (number of FFQ items reported to be consumed more than once a week)", "All tests of statistical significance were two-sided and the type I error was set at 5%.

First, meal planning might address the issue of not knowing what to prepare for dinner, that has been previously described as a barrier for home meal preparation [29].", "Second, by planning meals individuals may think about recipes that can be prepared in a limited period of time and, therefore reduce the feeling of time scarcity, that may limit home meal preparation", "[6, 12, 16] and increase the recourse to food choice coping strategies such as eating out, delivery meals or ready prepared food", "[17, 23–25]. In addition, planning meals may reduce the risk of missing ingredients for home meal preparation which could also lead to the consumption of food prepared away from home.", "Finally, deciding what foods will be eaten in the next few days could also enable individuals to cook more diversified recipes and to anticipate grocery shopping for the specific ingredients needed, thus potentially explaining the increased food variety observed in meal planners.", "However, reverse causality cannot be excluded since individuals interested in having a healthy diet might be more likely to plan their meals.", "In line with this idea, meal-planners in our sample were more likely to have higher educational level, to have higher income, to be physically active and to have a lower BMI, characteristics that have been related with a better attitude towards healthy eating [61].", "Our results showed that women who planned meals were less likely to be overweight or obese, while in men, there was an association with obesity only.", "Since meal planners have a diet of higher quality, it potentially prevents overweight in these individuals [52].", "However, we cannot exclude reverse causality.

The wounded men were taken", "to the Marine Hospital, in Norfolk, where one of them died. Intense", "indignation prevailed in the city. It was believed that the outrage", "was deliberately designed, and the cry for vengeance burst from the", "whole people. In full assembly, with the venerable General Matthews", "presiding, they appointed, as in the days of '76, a Committee of Safety.", "A preamble, duly setting forth the outrage on the \"Chesapeake,\" was", "adopted, and it was resolved that there should be no intercourse with", "the British frigates in the Norfolk waters, or with their agents, until", "the decision of the United States Government was known, under the", "penalty of being deemed infamous; and the Committee of Safety—", "Thomas Matthews, Thomas Newton, Jr., Luke Wheeler, Theodric", "Armistead, Richard E.

In the delicate dilemma,", "which was ominous of vengeful deeds and of so much menace to the", "commercial interests of Norfolk, he came to the assistance of the Mayor", "and dictated a reply to the audacious Briton which elicited the admiration", "of the whole American Nation. The letter, written on the 4th of", "The day on which this answer is written ought of itself to prove to", "the subjects of your sovereign that the American people are not to be", "imtimidated by menace; or induced to adopt any measures except by", "a sense of their perfect propriety.

In", "1820 Mr. Tazewell was one of the Commissioners under the Florida", "treaty. In 1824 he was elected to the United States Senate. He was", "elected to fill a vacancy caused by the resignation of John Taylor of", "Caroline. It is a coincidence that his father, thirty years before, was", "chosen to fill the vacancy in the Senate caused by the resignation of the", "same individual. L. W. Tazewell took his seat in January, 1825. His", "first efforts in the debates was on the bankrupt bill of that session—", "a searching examination of its details, which annihilated the hopes of its", "friends.

Whilst in attendance on that body he was elected", "by the Norfolk district a member of the Convention which assembled in", "Richmond, October 5th, 1829, to revise the first Constitution of Virginia.", "In that illustrious body Mr. Tazewell made the opening speech", "in support of a resolution which he offered, and which marked out the", "course of the campaign which he believed to be best adapted to attain", "the general end in view. He engaged with conspicuous ability in the", "important discussions of the convention. His speech on the tenure of", "the judicial office is claimed to have been one of the most able efforts in", "that body of intellectual giants. Mr. Tazewell was also, in 1829,", "tendered the mission to Great Britain, but declined the honor. He", "continued in the Senate until 1833, serving as Chairman of the Committee", "on Foreign Relations, and as President pro tem. of the body during", "a portion of the twenty-second Congress. In January, 1834, he", "was elected Governor of Virginia to succeed John Floyd, and entered", "upon the duties of his office March 31st.

These instructions", "Governor Tazewell declined to approve. He was succeeded in the office of", "Governor by Lieutenant-Governor Wyndham Robertson. Mr. Tazewell", "was never afterwards in public service. Though so effective with", "juries as an advocate, his style of address is said to have been singularly", "simple and free from artifice. His arguments were conversational and", "his gestures not more striking than those of animated converse. His", "postures were negligent. His voice was pleasant and of ample compass.", "He was never vociferous. His logic was consummate, and in putting", "his arguments before a jury he exhibited great adroitness. He acquainted", "himself with the calling or prejudices of every juryman—and", "When the passions were to be assailed he indulged in a style of fervid", "appeal, which was the more effective as it was rare. Of the person of", "Mr. Tazewell, his friend and eulogist, Hugh Blair Grigsby, LL.D.,", "says: \"As soon as the visitor fixed his eyes on Mr. Tazewell, all else", "was forgotten. He was, without exception, in middle life, the most imposing,", "and in old age, the most venerable person I ever beheld. His", "height exceeded six feet. * * * His head and chest were on a large", "scale, and his vast blue eye, which always seemed to gaze afar, was aptly", "handsome.

If a shareholder plaintiff recovers on a derivative claim, that recovery, like the claim itself, belongs to the corporation.44 Although the victorious shareholder may recover attorney fees and costs, any damages recovered belong to the entity.45 “A minority stockholder may sue because the corporations is under the control of the alleged wrongdoers, but he must sue in a representative capacity for the benefit of the corporation, and not for damages to him individually.”46", "The individual shareholders will only recover relative to their proportionate equity ownership in the company if those damages are distributed in the event of a dissolution and liquidation of the company or in the form of distributions or dividends.", "This is perhaps the most important consideration to keep in mind in framing claims and determining whether a particular shareholder should take on the burden of advancing a derivative claim.", "The concept of the derivative claim is rooted in the very foundation of corporate law and it has important practical implications.", "These implications clearly affect shareholders of corporations and members of LLCs and in some cases, partnerships.", "If this distinction is not well understood in advising clients and advancing litigation, the plaintiff’s case may be dismissed for failure to follow derivative pleading requirements or at the direction of a SLC.", "The plaintiff should understand the relative benefits and risks of advancing a derivative claim so that he or she is making an informed decision and navigate the gauntlet of litigation strategies that must be overcome.", "1 Wessin v.

What I found was that none of the transmission corridors proposed have transmission lines in them, and there’s no corridor of any other sort either. ???", "And further south, north and near Taconite, there’s a funnel where all options end up in a narrow area with three narrow corridors: one corridor has a line that they told me had been taken out; one corridor has no road or transmission line, nothing; and the other one has a line going smack dab down the corridor.", "Hmmmm, I wonder where they plan to put this new line?", "(and each time I try to pdf them for posting, firefox crashes, AAAAAAAAAGH!)", "… one moment please… or three… or four… I may never get that posted!", "Anyway, I also had a chat with a fleet of engineers, because in considering “need” for the line, I want to know the capacity of the line, meaning emergency rating, so that I can get an idea what the claimed need represents compared to potential capacity.", "So far, they say there’s a need for 250MW due to a PPA with Manitoba Hydro.

His father, physician Stephen Arnold Douglass, died when the baby was only two months old.", "His mother, Sarah Fiske Douglass, remarried to Gehazi Granger. In 1830, the Granger family moved from Vermont to upstate New York, where after a brief period at an academy Stephen Douglass began to read law under a locally prominent Democratic attorney.", "In 1833, Stephen made his way west to seek his career and fortune. After arriving in Quincy, Illinois, and operating a private school for a time, he secured a law license and set up practice in Jacksonville, Illinois.", "As he established the basis for a professional career, Stephen also changed the spelling of his last name from Douglass to Douglas.", "Stephen A. Douglas first became politically known in Illinois as a staunch Democratic proponent of President Andrew Jackson.", "Between 1835 and 1840, Douglas held a succession of Illinois state offices, some of them concurrently, including state’s attorney, state legislator, register of the Springfield land office, and secretary of state.", "In 1841, at the age of twenty-seven, he was elected to a seat on the Illinois Supreme Court. In 1836, he lost a disputed race for the U.S. House of Representatives by thirty-six popular votes.", "Four years later he lost a campaign for a U.S. Senate seat by five legislative votes. Only in 1843, running in a newly created congressional district, was Douglas able to win a seat in the House.", "As a member of the House of Representatives, Douglas was among those urging an extension of United States territory from the Atlantic to the Pacific.", "He called for the annexation of Texas, the establishment of military posts along the Western emigrant trails, and organization of a Nebraska territorial government.", "By 1845, these and other strong expansionist positions had won Douglas the chairmanship of the House Committee on Territories.", "Through a congressional colleague, Douglas met Martha Denny Martin (1825-1853), the daughter of a wealthy North Carolina planter and a member of a family long prominent in North Carolina political affairs.", "When Stephen and Martha were married in 1847, Robert Martin offered his new son-in-law his 2,500-acre plantation on the Pearl River in Lawrence County, Mississippi.", "Douglas declined the gift, but after Martin died a year later, the Pearl River plantation was bequeathed to Martha and any children she might have.", "Douglas was designated as the property manager and was allocated 20 per cent of the plantation’s annual income for his services.", "Two children born to their marriage survived into adulthood, Robert Martin Douglas (1849-1917) and Stephen Arnold Douglas, Jr. (1850-1908).", "In 1847, after only three years in the House of Representatives, Douglas was elected by the Illinois state legislature to a seat in the U.S. Senate, where he was made chairman of the Senate Committee on Territories.", "His position gave him an influential role in shaping all aspects of national policy affecting western lands, from the courts and post office to military posts and legislative powers.", "He also became quickly immersed in growing sectional disputes over the future of slavery. As a Senator from a state with a mix of strong anti-slavery and pro-slavery sentiment, and as the manager of a Mississippi plantation with more than 100 slaves, Douglas attempted to craft a political position that would avoid favoring either the North or South.", "The first significant test of this policy, the Compromise of 1850, is usually credited to Henry Clay, but it owed a great deal to Douglas' political skills.", "To satisfy the North, California was admitted as a free state, and the slave trade was abolished in the District of Columbia; to reassure the South, the territories of New Mexico and Utah were organized without a prohibition of slavery, and a rigid fugitive slave law was enacted.", "Despite this careful attempt to placate both sides in the slavery controversy, the reaction to the Compromise in the North was immediate and hostile.", "Douglas came under fierce attack in his home state and was able to calm his supporters only by rushing back to Illinois to defend himself before the Chicago city council and the state legislature.", "In 1853, Douglas sustained a grave personal loss when his wife Martha died following complications from the birth of a daughter.", "After their infant girl also died a few weeks later, a grieving Douglas decided to leave the country for an extended tour of Europe.", "His travels took him to London, Constantinople, Moscow, St. Petersburg, and Paris, in the course of which he secured a number of diplomatic audiences and met Czar Nicholas I and Emperor Napoleon III.", "Douglas' personal life did not recover its equilibrium until 1856, when he married twenty-one-year-old Rose Adele Cutts (1835-1899), known as Adele, whose father, James Madison Cutts, was a nephew of President James Madison and Dolley Madison.", "The new Mrs. Douglas accepted Douglas' two sons as her own and raised them with his approval in her own Catholic faith.", "Their infant daughter Ellen died shortly after birth in 1859. The Douglases built an imposing townhouse in Washington just north of Capitol Hill, and it soon became renowned for lavish parties and receptions.", "Douglas' personal affairs also changed in other respects. In 1857, Douglas sold the family plantation on the Pearl River, which had been affected by flooding and poor crops, and in partnership with James A. McHatton of Baton Rouge, moved the agricultural operation to a 2,000-acre property south of Greenville, Mississippi.", "Throughout his career, Douglas maintained a strong interest in science, education, and technological improvements.", "In 1850, Douglas secured the passage of federal legislation supporting the Illinois Central Railroad route from Chicago down the Mississippi Valley to New Orleans, thus helping to make Chicago and Illinois a national center for industry and commerce.", "Douglas was an enthusiastic supporter of the Smithsonian Institution from the time of its founding and in 1854 was appointed a regent of the Smithsonian.", "In 1858 Douglas gave ten acres on the south side of Chicago to serve as the site of the newly organized University of Chicago; the land was part of his Oakenwald estate, where Douglas planned to develop an exclusive suburban neighborhood and erect his own residence.", "Douglas' rising prominence in national affairs reached a crest in January 1854, when he introduced the Kansas-Nebraska bill to organize governments in the Kansas and Nebraska territories.", "In each territory, the question of slavery would be reserved until it entered the Union as a new state; at that time, the voting citizens would draw up a constitution and determine whether or not their state would permit slavery.", "The Kansas-Nebraska bill embodied Douglas' doctrine of popular sovereignty, according to which the voters in newly admitted states, not the federal government, would determine the future of slavery by exercising their democratic rights to self-government.", "Douglas also hoped that popular sovereignty would remove slavery from congressional debate and insulate the federal government from further sectional conflict.", "The Kansas-Nebraska Act, however, unleashed a new torrent of angry protest by Northern anti-slavery forces, who felt it opened the door to an expansion of slavery across the West.", "Douglas returned to Illinois to defend his position, touring the state for two months and twice trading opposing speeches with Abraham Lincoln, a former Whig legislator and congressman who reemerged on the political stage and became a spokesman for the new Republican Party.", "In the wake of the Kansas-Nebraska Act, Douglas also found himself at odds with important elements of the national Democratic party.", "He had first attempted to gain the Democratic nomination for president in 1852. In 1856, he tried once again for the presidential nomination, but withdrew his name in favor of James Buchanan, who went on to win the election.", "The brief alliance between Buchanan and Douglas ended within a year, however, when a pro-slavery convention meeting in Lecompton, Kansas, drew up a constitution proposing statehood and protecting property in slavery.", "Buchanan supported the Lecompton constitution, but Douglas was determined to block it, arguing that its passage was fraudulent and did not express the will of the people in accordance with popular sovereignty.", "Although Douglas could not prevent congressional approval of the constitution, it was later rejected by the voters of Kansas.", "The struggle over Kansas and the spread of slavery became the dominant theme in the Senate election campaign of 1858 in Illinois.", "Douglas was renominated by the Democrats, while Abraham Lincoln was selected as the Republican candidate.", "The campaign between Douglas and Lincoln gained unexpected attention when Lincoln pressed Douglas to agree to join in a series of debates.", "Staged in seven Illinois towns from August to October of 1858, the campaign debates between Douglas and Lincoln drew large crowds and generated detailed press coverage.", "Lincoln charged that Douglas was part of a slavery \"dynasty\" seeking to promote the spread of slavery over the entire nation.", "Douglas argued that Lincoln’s \"House Divided\" speech had pushed the country to the brink of division and that popular sovereignty would resolve the slavery issue.", "On election day, the Republicans won a majority of the popular vote across the state; the Illinois legislature, however, remained in the hands of the Democrats, and Douglas was returned to Washington for another Senate term.", "Douglas and Lincoln were to meet again in the tumultuous presidential election of 1860. Divisions within the Democratic Party had become so deep that when Democrats met first in Charleston and later in Baltimore for their nominating convention, the southern delegates walked out.", "Douglas was able to win the presidential nomination from the remaining northern delegates, but the breakaway Democrats turned to John C. Breckinridge of Kentucky as their candidate.", "The Constitutional Union party nominated John Bell of Tennessee, and the Republicans chose Abraham Lincoln to carry their banner, making the 1860 presidential election a four-way race.", "Douglas was so concerned about the sectional division in the Democratic party and the potential rupture of the federal Union that he decided to break with precedent and campaign on his own behalf, the first presidential candidate in American history to do so.", "Frequently accompanied by Adele, Douglas campaigned through all parts of the country, from New England, New York, and Pennsylvania to Virginia, Tennessee, Alabama, and Georgia.", "His desperate efforts to reunite the Democratic party, however, could not overcome the rapidly disintegrating political situation.", "In November 1860, none of the four presidential candidates secured a majority of the popular vote, but Abraham Lincoln carried the electoral college and won the White House.", "In the months following the presidential election, Douglas returned to Washington to join the efforts to prevent the secession of the southern states, engaging in a series of private meetings with Lincoln to map strategy.", "When the Illinois state legislature went into special session, Douglas traveled to Springfield to make an impassioned speech rallying citizens to a defense of the Union.", "Several weeks later, while staying the Tremont House hotel in Chicago, Douglas fell ill, and his condition soon began to deteriorate.", "On June 3, 1861, with his wife, Adele, at his side, he died.", "The funeral of Stephen A. Douglas was attended by more than 5,000 mourners. His body was laid to rest in a temporary tomb overlooking Lake Michigan, on the Oakenwald property that he had selected for his Chicago residence.", "In 1881, a permanent monument was erected on the site; its designer was Leonard W. Volk, whose wife was a cousin of Douglas and whose education as an artist had been sponsored by Douglas.", "The Civil War had immediate and devastating effects on Douglas family estate. In 1862, Camp Douglas, a Union military prison, was established at the northern end of the Oakenwald property; it housed more than 26,000 captured Confederate soldiers, of which 6,000 died.", "The Douglas mansion in Washington was turned over to the Federal government, and it was converted into a military hospital for the duration of the conflict.", "In Mississippi, the Greenville plantation was raided by Union troops, and the entire cotton crop was lost.", "Douglas' two sons later attempted to recover compensation from the federal government, but without success.", "After the war, Robert Martin Douglas graduated from Georgetown College, served as private secretary to President Ulysses S. Grant, and became a justice of the North Carolina Supreme Court.", "Stephen A. Douglas, Jr., who also studied at Georgetown, moved from North Carolina to Chicago and became an attorney.", "Adele Cutts Douglas remarried in 1866 to Brevet Brigadier General Robert Williams, who later became Adjutant General of the U.S. Army; they had six children.", "The Stephen A. Douglas collection is organized into seven series: Series I: Senate and Constituent Correspondence; Series II: Political; Series III: Personal; Series IV: Financial and Legal; Series V: Artifacts and Ephemera; Series VI: Oversized; and Series VII: Books.", "The largest portion of the collection is housed in Series I.

And this week, the company announced it will be fast-tracking the retirement of its two remaining coal-burning power plants, which are in Minnesota, by 2030.", "So make no mistake: This is industry-shaking news. Here’s our explainer, first published December 5.", "Greater ambition is in Xcel’s political and economic interests", "Xcel has been a leader on clean energy for a while. According to the company, it has reduced its carbon emissions by 35 percent since 2005.", "Earlier in 2018, it announced plans to, by 2030, reduce carbon emissions 60 percent (from 2005 levels), increase the level of renewable energy in its fleet to 55 percent, and shut down 50 percent of its coal capacity — in the state of Colorado.", "Those goals were enough to win the company Utility Dive’s Utility of the Year Award for 2018.", "But the new goals go much farther. And they cover Xcel’s entire eight-state territory.", "So what pushed the company’s ambition so much higher?", "First, renewables are getting really cheap. In its recent solicitations, Xcel has gotten more bids for renewables, with more variety, for much cheaper.", "Wind and solar plants paired with storage are bidding in cheaper than the ongoing operating costs of existing coal plants.", "Renewables are even giving natural gas a run for its money.", "Second, Xcel’s customers — particularly cities — are demanding it. “When your customers are asking for this over and over,” Fowke said when announcing the news, “you really do listen.", "Boulder, the city of Denver, Breckenridge ... Pueblo, they’re considered or they have already decided that they want to pursue 100 percent renewable.”", "Remember that, because it’s important in an age of no federal climate policy: Cities can move utilities, and utilities can move the energy industry.", "Third, the political landscape is shifting. Democrats took the governor’s mansion in Colorado, Michigan, New Mexico, and Wisconsin.", "In Colorado and New Mexico, they now have a “trifecta” — governor and both legislative houses. Running for governor in Colorado, Jared Polis supported a new renewable energy standard of 100 percent by 2040; with Democratic majorities in the state legislature, he might get it passed.", "Renewables are on the rise in the West, popular with politicians, cities, corporations, and ordinary ratepayers.", "It is to Xcel’s benefit to get ahead of the curve and give the people what they want.", "Fourth, Xcel would very much like to build more stuff.", "It is a vertically integrated monopoly. The areas in which it operates have not been “restructured,” i.e., generation has not been split off from transmission and distribution.", "Regulated monopoly utilities, as I’ve explained in previous stories, do not make money on the power they sell or the fuel they buy.", "They make money by drawing a rate of return on investments in power infrastructure. These “rate-based” investments are the utility’s bread and butter.", "In a broad sense, the shift to renewables is good for such utilities. When they shift from existing fossil fuel plants to new renewable energy, they shift from fuel (coal and natural gas) costs, which they make no money on, to investments in new renewable energy power plants, new batteries to store power and electric car chargers to help electrify the vehicle fleet, and tons of new transmission lines, much of which they can rate-base.", "These goals (perhaps combined with a new, more stringent RPS in Colorado) will help Xcel get permission from regulators to depreciate lots of uneconomic old fossil-fuel assets (which activists have been hassling it about anyway) and build, build, build a bunch of new stuff.", "In short, Xcel stands to profit handsomely, and benefit politically, by giving its customers the clean energy they want.", "(Many ratepayer advocates worry that utilities like Duke are taking advantage of this dynamic, using clean energy as an excuse to build stuff that local, distributed energy could handle better — but that’s a different post.)", "A more interesting question is how this might affect Xcel’s monopoly status. On one hand, riding a political wave as a climate champion allows it to stay ahead of grumbling or desire for restructuring.", "On the other hand, Xcel suddenly needing so much clean energy might help grease the skids for regionalization, i.e., the creation of a restructured Western wholesale power market run by a regional transmission operator (RTO).", "If all of the West is heading toward decarbonization together, the region’s utilities will need to pool their resources.", "In fact, they might need to pool their resources rapidly, because the federal tax credits for wind and solar power are set to expire soon.", "Buying a lot of capacity before then could save a lot of money.", "Fifth — and this may be somewhat peripheral, but it’s interesting — on the very same day Xcel made its announcement, the Boulder City Council voted to move forward with creating a municipal utility and breaking off from Xcel.", "Xcel very much opposes that move. By ramping up its clean energy goals, it may not keep Boulder, but it could dissuade other similar-minded cities from following Boulder out the door.", "Anyway, the decision to go carbon-free by 2050 is not a selfless act on Xcel’s part — it sees which way the wind is blowing and is focused on providing returns for shareholders.", "And the announcement leaves many, many details unspecified, including plans to shut down fossil fuel plants and transition plans for affected communities.", "Nonetheless, it shows that incentives are beginning to align in a hopeful way. It is the smart move, politically and economically, for Xcel to set a course for zero carbon.", "That would have been unthinkable 10 or even five years ago.", "A few other aspects of this story are worth highlighting.", "Xcel explicitly did not promise 100 percent renewable electricity. It promised 100 percent carbon-free electricity.", "In this, it echoed California’s recent bill SB 100, which committed the state to 100 percent carbon-free energy by 2045.", "The difference is that carbon-free includes not only renewables but also advanced nuclear power plants and fossil fuel power plants with carbon capture and sequestration, either of which Xcel may end up needing to get to 100.", "The company believes that its 2030 goal can be achieved affordably with renewable energy and other technologies currently available.", "However, achieving the long-term vision of zero-carbon electricity requires technologies that are not cost effective or commercially available today.", "That is why Xcel Energy is committed to ongoing work to develop advanced technologies while putting the necessary policies in place to achieve this transition.", "Both sides of this message are incredibly important and poorly understood by the general public.", "First, we have a really good idea of how to get to 80 percent. Climate researcher Christopher Clack and his team showed in 2016 that the entire US could get to 80 percent using existing commercial technologies.", "We know we can get to 80, but 80 is a long, long way off almost everywhere. There is, in other words, no reason to wait.", "And second, we’re not yet sure how to get that last 20 percent, so we need to keep researching new techniques and technologies in the meantime.", "Xcel is going to work with state regulators to try to do some ratepayer-supported R&D.

It’s very likely that to stay on track for its carbon targets, Xcel will need to keep those plants running for longer than that.", "Math like this is what has driven a substantial recent shift in opinion among greens about the wisdom of keeping existing nuclear plants open.", "Somewhat by coincidence, the same day Xcel made its announcement, A.P. Moller-Maersk, the world’s largest shipping container company, announced that it will target carbon neutrality by 2050, though, it said, “carbon neutral vessels must be commercially viable by 2030, and an acceleration in new innovations and adaption of new technology is required.”", "This came on the heels, last month, of Google’s announcement that it would strive to run all its operations on 100 percent clean energy, at all times, around the clock.", "There are now hundreds of companies (Ikea, Apple, BMW, Coca-Cola, Facebook, etc.), more than 90 US cities (Minneapolis, Denver, St. Louis, Atlanta, Salt Lake City, etc.), and two US states (Hawaii and California) committed to reaching 100 percent clean electricity.", "This is how the real target — zero net carbon — will arrive in the US: not in a blinding flash or a big federal bill (at least not at first), but like a virus or a meme, catching hold and spreading through contact.", "Researchers have found that both rooftop solar panels and electric vehicles are contagious. People are more likely to buy them when they see other people buying them.", "Human beings are social creatures, not autonomous utility maximizers. We don’t reason through our purchases and our lifestyles; we generally adopt what’s around us and do what people like us do.", "The very same is true of urban policy makers, corporate officers, utility executives, and state regulators.", "You can show them all the charts and graphs you want — until they see others like them doing these things, they won’t feel confident.", "Now more and more people are doing it, and more and more people are seeing other people doing it.

It's a big company,\" he said. \"So I think it's more probably just an opportunistic move.\"", "In the utility's Jan. 30 earnings call, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer Robert Frenzel acknowledged the unregulated asset would provide lower returns for shareholders.", "\"We expect the non-regulatory returns will be slightly lower in the near term and more robust towards the back end of the forecast,\" he said.", "A portion of the MEC sale will go toward \"corporate giving efforts, including support related to the COVID-19 recovery,\" according to the utility's press release.", "Though the portion donated won't be known until the transaction is closed, Xcel expects proceeds to total over $20 million in corporate giving and relief efforts across the eight states it operates in.", "The sale is expected to close in the third quarter of 2020 and is not expected to impact short or long-term earnings, according to the utility.", "Xcel will continue to purchase power from the plant through the length of the original power purchase agreement.", "\"I'm surprised, and in some ways, as an Xcel customer, pleased for them that they're going to be able to offload this thing after having just bought it, because it was never a good idea to own it,\" Minneapolis-based John Farrell, co-director of the Institute for Local Self-Reliance, told Utility Dive.", "Xcel was initially supposed to file an updated modeling scenario including the gas plant April 1, but its deadline has been extended to May 15.", "A 2017 law allows the utility to build a gas plant to replace the power from its over 2.2 GW coal-fired Sherco power plant, circumventing regulators, but the size of that buildout still needs to be approved by the PUC.", "\"We're going to play this game all over again with Xcel here in just another month,\" said Farrell. \"Again, Xcel is going to have to prove that they need a gas plant.", "And I think, again, they're going to find out actually, it's not going to pay off for us to do that.

One consideration is the fact that conventional fossil generation and nuclear plants employ significantly more people than solar and wind farms.", "Indian Point, a nuclear plant in New York that is being shut down has 1,000 full-time workers; Wind Catcher, one of the largest wind projects in the U.S., will only need 80-90 operators when completed.[8] How can Xcel Energy and other utilities mitigate the impact of job losses?", "Another important consideration is that the U.S. energy grid is critical infrastructure to national security.", "Any flaws in the implementation of the smart grid, whether security breaches or fundamental errors in the system, could cause catastrophic damage to the economy and potential loss of life – how can companies ensure the technology is safe because the stakes are so high?", "[1] Bullis, Kevin. “Smart Wind and Solar Power.” MIT Technology Review, 20 Nov. 2014, www.technologyreview.com/s/526541/smart-wind-and-solar-power/.", "[2] “NCAR to Develop Advanced Wind and Solar Energy Forecasting System for Kuwait.” NCAR & UCAR News, 4 May 2017, news.ucar.edu/126802/ncar-develop-advanced-wind-and-solar-energy-forecasting-system-kuwait.", "[3] Proctor, Cathy.

The indirect effect is that of shifting market share toward the low-cost firm.", "If firms are relatively close in terms of their adjustment costs, the former will dominate the latter since the shift in market share must be small.", "As heterogeneity in adjustment cost grows, the impact of regulation on market share grows, eventually overtaking the direct effect of increasing costs.", "From here on I refer to any equilibrium in which one firm lobbies in favor of climate change regulation as a “competitive equilibrium.”", "To provide support for this core result I construct a measure of individual firm support for the ACES by comparing lobbying activity reported under the Federal Lobbying Disclosure Act with public statements of support for H.R.2454.Footnote 39 Firms that both disclose lobbying activity and take a public stance in favor of the climate change bill are coded as supportive.", "Information on lobbying disclosures is obtained from the Center for Responsive Politics. I construct a measure of anticipated competitor costs by calculating for each firm i (1) the share of competitors within industry j located in zip codes above the median in terms of coal usage in electricity generation and (2) the share of competitors in industry j located in zip codes containing coal reserves.", "Footnote 40 The resulting measures vary both within industry and within region, reflecting firm i's own location relative to the geographic distribution of its competitors.", "The full sample consists of all US-based publicly traded firms whether or not they disclose lobbying activity.", "Footnote 41 Data on publicly traded firms as well as a number of financial covariates are obtained from the Osiris database.", "In total I identify 8,216 unique firms representing 276 industries.

Moving from the mean to one standard deviation above the mean for either independent variable increases the probability of lobbying in favor of climate change legislation by around 70 percent when compared with the observed base rate of lobbying.", "Footnote 45 Although these estimates are purely correlational and should be interpreted with care, they are suggestive of exactly the relationship between firm competition and political behavior described earlier in the formal model.", "Appendix B1 contains the full results of both models along with additional results confirming the robustness of the findings.", "Before moving to the analysis of an open economy setting I briefly note two additional results. Let F i > 2F j so that γ i > 0.", "One question with implications for the design of climate change regulation is how increasing or decreasing heterogeneity in adjustment costs would affect equilibrium policymaking.", "As noted earlier equilibrium regulation depends on both average and relative marginal costs of regulation.", "These two quantities are closely linked. Suppose that γ i > 0 so that firm i has lower adjustment costs than firm j. Increasing F", "i has the dual effect of decreasing average adjustment costs and increasing firm heterogeneity. Both of these effects tend to increase equilibrium regulation.", "Thus in this case a decrease in average adjustment costs is associated with a higher level of regulation.", "Consider instead a decrease in the adjustment costs for firm j. Again this has the effect of lowering average costs of regulation.", "This should lead to a higher level of equilibrium regulation, all else equal. Yet increasing F j also has implications for firm heterogeneity: by decreasing the distance between firms’ adjustment costs, an increase in F j reduces firm", "i's incentive to lobby in favor of climate change legislation. This exerts a countervailing effect on equilibrium regulation.", "The overall effect of increasing F j then depends on the relative strength of these two dynamics. Proposition 3 establishes that in some cases the latter may outweigh the former: increasing F j reduces average adjustment costs, yet leads to strictly lower equilibrium regulation.", "Proposition 3. There exists a competitive equilibrium in which regulation is strictly decreasing in the less competitive firm's green capital.", "Proposition 3 suggests that the allocation of free permits or other subsidy-like aspects to climate change regulation can have significant implications for the emergence of private sector support.", "These measures are often seen as key to the political success of climate change legislation. The result takes on particular significance in the context of international negotiations in which climate finance has traditionally played a central role.", "A key achievement of the Paris Agreement is the commitment by developed countries to provide around USD 100 billion annually in funds to assist developing countries in mitigation and adaptation.", "Figure 7 depicts the distribution of climate finance already disbursed at the time of Paris negotiations.", "Proposition 3 suggests that the allocation of these funds within developing countries’ domestic economies will have significant implications for the balance of support or opposition for climate change commitments in the developing world.", "The final result establishes an important connection between policymakers’ ideology and firms’ propensity to support climate change legislation and adds additional support to the empirical plausibility of the model.", "Earlier I described several examples of firm lobbying in favor of climate change legislation.

Footnote 47 Since regulation increases costs of production and thus prices for consumers, it reduces overall firm profitability.", "For a positive level of regulation to prevail it must be the case that the policymaker has a positive marginal value for regulation, offsetting these economic losses.", "The surprising result related to firm lobbying is that even when the policymaker holds no value for regulation, the antiregulation firm must still offer contributions to deter lobbying from green firms that might otherwise—in isolation—induce a skeptical policymaker to depart from his ideal policy of 0 and implement a positive level of regulation.", "To illustrate the logic of this result, consider firm lobbying on climate change policy during the Bush administration, the vast majority of which was carried out exclusively by firms opposed to US participation in the Kyoto Protocol.", "One oil industry group, the Global Climate Coalition (GCC) was particularly instrumental in the administration's decision to withdraw from the treaty.", "As noted in official documents released under a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request, Paula Dobriansky, then US under-secretary of state, is noted as thanking the GCC for its “active involvement” and confirming that “Potus rejected Kyoto in part based on input from you.”Footnote 49", "This was the case despite the administration's own predisposition against climate change regulation. Climate and energy policy fell under the portfolio of then Vice President Dick Cheney, a notorious opponent of climate change policy.", "Footnote 50 Cheney appointed Jim Connaughton as chairman of the Council on Environmental Quality who made it his mission to obstruct any progress on climate change regulation, even appointing a former employee of the American Petroleum Institute (one of the core founders of the GCC) as his top deputy.", "While utilities companies and other manufacturers were also outspoken in their opposition to climate change policy there is no evidence of significant counter-vailing pressure from supportive firms, consistent with the predictions of Proposition 4.Footnote 51", "Here I consider the implications of green lobbying in an open economy setting.

Again, I assume that α is sufficiently large that all incumbent firms choose to continue production even under the most stringent possible regulatory outcome.", "Footnote 54 All other aspects of the game remain as before.", "By increasing marginal production costs for domestic firms only, climate change regulation clearly worsens these firms’ competitive position relative to foreign competitors.", "Nonetheless, as the next result establishes, domestic firms may continue to support higher levels of climate change regulation.", "Denote by $F_{{-}i}^M $ the harmonic mean of green capital among firm i's domestic competitors, $j\\in {\\cal M}\\backslash i$.Footnote 55", "Proposition 5.

The first corresponds to the (inverse) proportion of firm i's competitors subject to domestic regulation.", "The second term describes the distribution of green capital among these domestic competitors. Firm i's support for climate change regulation depends not only on the relative market share of foreign firms but also its competitiveness with respect to the domestic firms.", "The case of export competition differs from that of import competition in that exporting firms now compete with their domestic competitors both at home and in some cases abroad in the foreign market.", "Again, foreign firms themselves will be unaffected by domestic climate change regulation.

to gain advantage over domestic market competitors and that these gains may even offset competitive losses relative to foreign firms.", "In a closed economy model of policymaking and market competition I show that firms holding an advantage in adjustment costs may see increased profits following the introduction of carbon regulation and thus find it optimal to invest resources in lobbying in support of the new regime.", "This conclusion is supported by statistical analysis of firms’ lobbying in favor of US climate change legislation.", "These same intuitions carry over to an open economy setting where firms facing import penetration—or engaged in export competition—may find it optimal to support climate change regulation despite competitive losses relative to foreign

"Contrary to existing literature, the analysis demonstrates that the impact of foreign competition on firm preferences for climate change policy depends on competitive dynamics in the domestic market.", "Finally in the context of global value chains I show that multinational corporations are more likely to support efforts to mitigate global climate change if those efforts raise the costs of domestically produced intermediate goods, providing an alternative to the conventional wisdom that MNCs support climate change regulation in order to bring about harmonization of national policies.",

economy of climate change, the environmental effects of open borders, and the study of firms in international cooperation.", "Existing accounts of firm support for climate change regulation rely on idiosyncratic features of regulatory design or the sequencing of regulation across countries.", "The benchmark results provide a more general explanation for the emergence of support for climate change legislation.", "Competition between domestic firms is a sufficient condition for supportive lobbying in nearly any regulatory context.", "Given the obstructionist policies of the United States, the substantive implications of this argument suggest that pressure for climate change regulation need not rely on leadership by the world's remaining super power, but can arise endogenously as a result of competitive dynamics between firms.", "Turning to the perennial question of how globalization affects environmental welfare, my arguments suggest that the overall effect is more complex than has been appreciated thus far.", "Open borders do not necessarily dampen support for climate change policy and in some cases may provide special impetus for firms to come out in favor of national

chains.", "US domestic regulation may be undermined by carbon leakage, yet carbon leakage may also increase the likelihood of passing climate change legislation in one of the world's largest emitters of carbon dioxide.", "Finally, the current work builds on existing models of open economy politics by incorporating insights from the growing literature on intra-industry heterogeneity.", "In spite of recent advances in the field in firm-level analysis of policy preferences, existing work in this area has yet to appreciate the importance of intra-industry variation with respect to domestic competitors.", "Footnote 67 The arguments here show that firm preferences for international cooperation will be shaped by their competitive position with respect to both domestic and foreign

With 2019 at around the halfway point, we check in on the top public utility commission (PUC) actions and trends so far this year.", "Ten prominent trends and actions stand out above the rest, from renewables increasingly dominating utility resource plans, to wildfires sparking utility safety and liability concerns in California, to transportation electrification investments becoming more widespread from coast to coast.", "Here is the full round-up of the top 10 matters before PUCs so far in 2019.", "Note: some links in this post reference PUC filings and other documents in AEE's software platform, PowerSuite.", "During the first six months of 2019, the trend in recent years has continued toward a more advanced, clean, and flexible grid.", "This has largely been driven by the continued price decline in renewables. In most states, it is now often cheaper to build new wind and solar plants (in some cases even when paired with storage) than to operate existing fossil-fuel power plants.", "Utilities are starting to take notice, and renewables are dominating their long-term resource plans. As you can see in the map below, at least nine states plus Puerto Rico and D.C., have now set 100% clean energy targets.", "(For a discussion of this trend and its implications for utilities, regulators, and renewable energy developers, see AEE’s recent webinar, “What Happens When Wind and Solar Win on Price?”).", "To kick off 2019, the New Mexico Public Regulation Commission approved Public Service Co. of New Mexico’s (PNM) latest integrated resource plan (IRP), which calls for the retirement of all coal-fired generation in its portfolio by 2031.", "In Michigan, DTE Electric Co. and Consumers Energy Co. both recently proposed plans to phase out coal by 2040.", "In March, DTE proposed 11 MW of solar-plus-storage projects and 693 MW of wind projects over the next five years, followed by 525 MW of solar between 2025 and 2030 and another 2 GW by 2040.", "In June, the Public Service Commission approved Consumers’ plan, which calls for 5 GW of new solar by 2030 and a 90% reduction in carbon emissions by 2040.", "In April, Public Service Co. of Colorado received approval for the construction of a $743 million, 500 MW wind farm (representing about 8% of its peak summer demand), which the utility aims to bring into commercial operation by the end of 2020, to take advantage of the full value of the federal production tax credit.", "This represents only a small piece of the power company’s expected energy transition over the next couple decades, with the goal of achieving 100% carbon neutral generation by 2050.", "In April, Northern Indiana Public Service Co (NIPSCO) filed a petition for a $21 million annual electric revenue increase, that is premised on its most recent integrated resource plan which proposes to retire all coal in its fleet by 2028 and replace it with a portfolio of solar, storage, wind and demand management.", "NIPSCO stated its plan is expected to save customers $4 billion over the next 30 years.", "In June, Georgia Power reached a settlement agreement in its 2019 Integrated Resource Plan that calls for the retirement of close to 1 GW of coal generating capacity and the procurement of 1.5 GW of renewable resources and 150 MW of distributed generation resources.", "This plan marks the continued steep decline in Georgia Power’s emissions in recent years driven by plant economics, as these planned retirements are in addition to 3.1 GW of already retired coal plants — representing about 20% of its existing peak load.", "Even Mississippi, which historically has not been a hot bed for renewables, is joining the party. At the beginning of the year, Entergy Mississippi filed an application for a $138 million, 100 MW solar facility.", "Entergy said they are pursuing the solar facility because of increasing customer interest and the recent reductions in solar costs.", "If approved, it would be the first large-scale, utility-owned solar project constructed in Mississippi.", "Many states are exploring changes to the traditional cost-of-service regulatory model to move toward a system that better reflects new market conditions, allows utilities to take advantage of the growing service economy, and rewards performance against established goals rather than inputs.", "For more information, take a look at the Navigating Utility Business Model Reform paper and series of case studies AEE Institute released in November, in collaboration with Rocky Mountain Institute and America's Power Plan.", "The case studies highlight utility business model reforms being implemented in the U.S and abroad while the paper lays out a menu of business model reform options and practical guidance for pursuing reform at the state level.", "In January, the Minnesota Public Utilities Commission (PUC) finalized Phase 1 in its performance based regulation (PBR) investigation for the state’s largest utility — Xcel Energy.", "The Commission kicked off Phase 2 in March, which commenced a stakeholder process to create a set of metrics for the five performance outcomes established in Phase 1 – affordability, reliability, customer service quality, environmental performance, and cost-effectively aligning generation to load.", "In January, New York’s Con Edison filed a petition to increase its annual electric and gas delivery revenues.", "A key component of the rate case is the implementation of earnings adjustment mechanisms (EAMs) -- New York’s version of performance incentive mechanisms -- coming out of the Reforming the Energy Vision (REV) initiative.", "The Public Utilities Commission of Hawaii (PUC) concluded Phase 1 and set the groundwork for Phase 2 in its proceeding to develop a new PBR framework for the Hawaiian Electric Companies.", "In May, the PUC issued a Phase 1 decision which identified 12 key outcomes and a portfolio of priority PBR mechanisms for updating Hawaii's regulatory design.", "The Decision established the guiding principles and objectives for Phase 2 to include: (1) setting a revenue target to optimize near-term customer savings; (2) enhancing customer engagement; (3) improving DER performance; (4) streamlining utility performance; and (5) re-aligning financial incentives with societal outcomes (e.g., GHG reductions, transportation electrification, resilience).", "Phase 2 will formally begin in August and focus on revenue adjustment mechanisms and performance mechanisms as the main track for exploring and developing PBR.", "The Colorado Public Utilities Commission will also soon be engaged in re-thinking utility regulation with the passage of SB 236 — the PUC Sunset bill signed into law in May.", "Among other things, the bill requires the PUC to study the impacts of performance-based metrics to better understand and identify mechanisms that would encourage the state’s utilities to make investment decisions that benefit the public good, increase energy savings, and improve safety and reliability.", "The bill also authorizes the creation of a ratepayer-backed bonding mechanism (securitization) to expedite the closure of outmoded power plants as the state transitions to cleaner, more economic resources.", "In addition to these efforts to rethink utility business models and regulation on a broad basis, many states have taken on specific aspects of reforming how utilities conduct their planning and operations, such as distribution system planning (see #3) and procuring non-wires alternatives to traditional utility investments (see #4).", "3. Distribution System Planning for Distributed Resources", "The distribution grid is the backbone of a reliable electric system used to deliver electricity from the transmission system to individual consumers.", "Modern planning processes are critical for providing essential electric service efficiently and cost-effectively.", "As DER deployment continues to grow, utilities and DER companies are seeking ways to maximize the benefits of DERs to the system, while maintaining reliability and reasonable costs for customers.", "New York and California have continued to refine their distribution system planning processes in 2019, while several additional states have taken steps to implement processes of their own.", "In February, the New Hampshire Public Utilities Commission staff issued a report with a recommended approach for utilities to assess their distribution systems, conduct least-cost distribution planning strategies, and incorporate grid modernization initiatives.", "In April, Ohio's utilities (AEP Ohio, Duke Energy, and FirstEnergy) filed their grid architecture status reports, as required by the Public Utility Commission of Ohio's PowerForward roadmap, to identify where each utility stands on its path to a modern grid.", "The reports differ widely from utility to utility. Most notably, FirstEnergy's report is noticeably shorter and less comprehensive than the other utilities' reports.", "That said, topics in the reports range from a status report on grid architecture (i.e., field automation, substation automation, operational communications infrastructure, sensing and measurement, operational analytics, and standardized access to customer energy usage data) to an assessment of distribution system planning practices and ability to integrate new technologies.", "In addition to the actions mentioned above, a few other states have continued their existing distribution system planning investigations in 2019, including Hawaii, Michigan, and Minnesota.", "One of the core outputs of distribution system planning is recognizing opportunities for new advanced technologies and services to meet system needs — which we explore next.", "4. Non-Wires Alternatives to Traditional Utility Investments", "Non-wires alternatives (NWAs) to traditional investments in transmission and distribution equipment are increasingly being looked to as viable options in several key states.", "The next steps to making NWAs a widespread reality are to (1) identify the areas where NWAs can meet a need at a lower cost than a traditional utility investment, and (2) develop a framework to implement and/or procure the NWA solution.", "Several states have made significant progress so far in 2019.", "In January 2019, Con Edison in New York outlined its plan to continue implementation of its Brooklyn Queens Demand Management (BQDM) program through 2021.", "The utility plans to continue procurement of additional load reduction above the original 41 MW of non-traditional customer-side electricity demand reduction solutions (projecting 44.5 MW by 2021) and 11 MW of non-traditional utility-side solutions (projecting 18 MW by 2021).", "For a deep dive on the BQDM program and its success so far, see AEE’s case study here.", "In June 2018, Central Maine Power and Emera Maine filed recommendations that would eliminate their existing incentive to favor transmission and distribution (T&D) investments over NWAs.", "Specifically, they called for: 1) a revenue decoupling mechanism, 2) a ratemaking approach to treat NWA investments in a similar manner to T&D investments, and 3) an approval process for NWA proposals.", "As a follow-on to those recommendations, the utilities were ordered to submit supplemental filings in March outlining how they consider and implement NWAs are part of their T&D investment planning processes.", "In May, the California Public Utilities Commission issued a ruling modifying the distribution investment deferral framework process, an annual process (first implemented in 2018) to identify, review, and select opportunities for third party-owned DERs to defer or avoid traditional capital investments.", "As part of the ruling, the CPUC streamlined the planning process to reduce the time associated with stakeholder participation.", "The Commission ordered utilities to file their grid needs assessment – identifying the technical and operational planning needs they need to meet five-year load growth forecasts – and a distribution deferral opportunity report – identifying utilities’ planned investments and opportunities for third party-owned DERs to avoid or defer those investments by August.", "5. Wildfire Liability Challenging California Utilities", "In January, the largest investor-owned utility in California — Pacific Gas & Electric (PG&E) — filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy because of accrued liabilities resulting from the devastating wildfires of 2018.", "As part of the bankruptcy process, PG&E sought and received approval for $5.5 billion in financing to support operations and ongoing safety initiatives during the bankruptcy process.", "There are still a lot of unanswered questions that will need to be sorted out through the courts. One of the most important questions for the advanced energy industry will be whether PG&E is granted the ability to renegotiate a portion of their existing $34.5 billion in renewable energy contracts to help pay down their debts.", "A decision that could encumber California’s efforts to meet its clean energy and greenhouse gas reduction goals.", "Outside of the bankruptcy process, the wildfires kick started wide ranging investigations into wildfire prevention and cost recovery plans, as well as PG&E’s safety culture.", "At the start of the year, the California Public Utilities Commission opened an investigation to determine if PG&E, as currently constituted, is able to provide safe electric and gas service and to review alternatives to PG&E's current management and operational structures.", "As a result of that investigation, the Commission established a Commission Advisory Panel of experts to advise the Commission on corporate governance issues to ensure that utilities are prioritizing safety moving forward.", "More pointedly, the Commission in late June introduced four proposals (which the Commission is currently seeking comments on) to improve PG&E’s safety culture.", "The four proposed pathways include: (1) separating PG&E into separate gas and electric utilities or selling the gas assets; (2) establishing periodic review of PG&E’s Certificate of Convenience and Necessity (CPCN) to operate as a monopoly in California; (3) modifying or eliminating PG&E's holding company structure; and (4) linking PG&E’s rate of return or return on equity to safety performance metrics.", "If adopted, any one of these pathways would have wide-ranging implications.", "Also in June, the CPUC adopted a set of criteria and a methodology for conducting a financial “stress test” for future wildfire cost recovery.", "The methodology is intended to inform determinations of the maximum amount an electric corporation can pay without affecting their ability to raise money in capital markets, which could ultimately harm ratepayers or affect their ability to provide safe and adequate service.", "As renewable energy has become more competitive on price, customers are increasingly looking for ways to not only power their operations with 100% renewable energy, but also dampen price volatility and reduce energy costs.", "There are several avenues for customers to increase their access to renewable energy ranging from direct access programs to renewable energy tariffs to community solar programs.", "(For a discussion of best practices and steps that states and utilities can take to meet large customer demand for renewable energy, see the Advanced Energy Buyers Group’s recent report here.)", "In January, Xcel Energy in Minnesota filed for approval to expand their Renewable*Connect Pilot Program (a renewable energy tariff aimed at businesses that want access to renewable energy) into a full-fledged program.", "Xcel stated that the pilot sold out in one year and there are more than 400 customers on a waiting list.", "In March, the California Public Utilities Commission opened a rulemaking to implement SB 237, reopening of the state’s direct access (DA) program.", "The DA program, which has been limited to about 11% of peak load since 2010, allows retail nonresidential customers to purchase electricity service directly from competitive providers.", "In June, the Commission issued a Phase 1 order to expand the DA cap by 4 TWh or an additional 2% to 3% of peak load allocated proportionally to the investor-owned utilities' service territories.", "Phase 2, which is expected to begin before the end of the year, will be focused on the second requirement of SB 237, issuing recommendations to the Legislature on a full expansion of the DA cap to nonresidential customers by June 1, 2020.", "In May, Dominion Energy In Virginia filed an application for a 100% renewable energy tariff that would allow customers with under 5 MW of peak demand to receive 100% of their energy and capacity from a portfolio of renewable resources owned or procured by Dominion for a premium over standard service.", "In March, Florida Power & Light (FP&L) proposed a solar subscription program — SolarTogether. The program would give customers of all rate classes the option to subscribe to blocks of solar capacity (with no long-term commitment) from dedicated 74.5 MW solar power plants.", "FPL stated it has already pre-registered 200 customers, totaling 1,000 MW, for the program, mostly from commercial and industrial customers.", "Community choice aggregation (CCA) or municipal aggregation has been around for a few decades but it has risen in popularity the past couple of years, driven in large part by communities wishing to take control over how their energy is generated.", "The concept of CCA is fairly simple. CCAs are classified as governmental entities, most often formed by cities and/or counties, that procure power on behalf of their residents.", "While the CCA provides power for residents, the designated utility still continues to provide transmission and distribution service in the area.", "In California, CPUC staff has estimated that by 2025 over 85% of California’s IOU retail load could be served by Community Choice Aggregators and other DA providers (up from about 20% today).", "On the opposite coast, New York recently refined its framework to make it easier to form CCAs, which has led to several municipalities filing implementation plans.", "In January, the Massachusetts Department of Public Utilities (DPU) opened an investigation into improving the retail electric competitive supply market in Massachusetts, including increasing customer awareness of the competitive market and the value it can provide.", "In June, the DPU established two working groups which, among other things, will focus on improvements to the Energy Switch website, including but not limited to the display of municipal aggregation products.", "This is a timely investigation, as in June, the City of Boston petitioned the DPU to approve a community choice aggregation plan to procure power on behalf of its residents.", "If approved, the plan would allow the City to solicit the necessary power in October 2019 and start service in January 2020.", "The deployment of electric vehicle (EV) charging infrastructure has risen to the fore in many jurisdictions, as improvements in technology have dramatically expanded the EV market and PUCs have continued to develop focused transportation electrification strategies.", "(For more information on what utility commissioners need to know about the accelerating EV market, see AEE’s EV issue brief.)", "California continues to lead on transportation electrification (TE), with 49% of the nation’s electric car sales originating in the Golden State.", "At the turn of the year, the California Public Utilities Commission initiated a rulemaking to provide more structure and guidance on future transportation electrification investments and to streamline the application process.", "Under California’s existing construct, all utility applications have been considered on a case-by-case basis, which has led to a prolonged review process and unfocused investment strategy.", "This new process, referred to as the DRIVE OIR, seeks to develop a TE framework that will help to strategically integrate TE load; enhance market coordination of utility investments; enable private sector investments; achieve policy cohesiveness on key issues (i.e., rate design, consumer education, and vehicle-grid integration (VGI) policy); and evaluate cost effectiveness of investments and different ownership and cost recovery models.", "A staff proposal for a TE framework is expected to be issued in October.", "In January, the Public Service Commission of Wisconsin opened an investigation to consider policies and regulations in regards to EVs and their associated supply infrastructure in Wisconsin.", "In February, the Missouri Public Service Commission opened a proceeding to evaluate potential mechanisms for utility involvement in EV charging stations.", "The proceeding seeks to evaluate the following three models: (1) utility owned and operated charging stations; (2) a utility “make ready” option; and (3) an alternative incentive program where program parameters, implementation, and cost recovery would be evaluated and defined in a future rate proceeding.", "In February, the New York Public Service Commission issued an order approving a proposed incentive program to encourage the deployment of public direct current fast charging (DCFC) stations.", "The consensus proposal – which was jointly filed by the state's utilities, the New York Power Authority, the Department of Environmental Conservation, the Department of Transportation, the New York State Thruway Authority, and the New York State Energy Research and Development Authority (NYSERDA) – will provide $31.6 million in incentives for over 1,000 publicly accessible DCFC charging stations.", "Specifically, each utility will offer an annual per-plug incentive that will decline over time as electric vehicle usage, and thus DCFC utilization, increases.", "In June, the Vermont Public Utility Commission submitted a report to the state legislature recommending the removal of barriers to the adoption of EVs, including more EV purchase incentives, easier pathways for the installation of public charging infrastructure, and increased education and outreach.", "The Arizona Corporation Commission (ACC) has also been in the thick of developing an EV policy implementation plan in 2019 that provides guidelines for utilities to propose EV pilot programs focused on structure, education and outreach, make-ready, rate design, incentives/rebates, and cost recovery.", "There has been no shortage of activity across the country with utility proposals or statewide investigations in Colorado, Delaware, Iowa, Maryland, Michigan (DTE Electric and Consumers Energy) Minnesota, North Carolina, Oregon, South Carolina (Duke Energy Progress and Duke Energy Carolinas), and Texas.", "For an overview of the benefits of electrifying transportation, with a specific focus on the medium- and heavy-duty vehicle sector, see our recently released industry fact sheet here.", "9. Grid Modernization Investments for DER and Large-Scale Renewables", "Grid modernization is often used in the electricity industry as a catch-all term for grid investment.", "However, at AEE, we view grid modernization as comprising the foundational investments needed to enable a reliable and flexible grid.", "Such a modern grid platform is essential to fully integrating DER, balancing increasing levels of large-scale renewables and enhancing the customer experience.", "The first step toward grid modernization is often advanced metering infrastructure. In May, Indiana Michigan Power took this first step by filing an application in Indiana as part of a larger general rate case asking for full smart meter deployment by 2022.", "Other states are looking at grid modernization more holistically. In March, the Arkansas Public Service Commission kicked off a long-awaited DER and grid modernization investigation.", "The first phase of the investigation will inform stakeholders on the existing state of the grid, including aging distribution infrastructure, the role of data in a modern grid, and the impact of DER on utility planning and operation.", "Meanwhile in the District of Columbia, six working groups with over 100 participants across industry, government, consulting, and advocacy groups met from August 2018 to May 2019, working through a variety of issues facing its electric power system.", "The collaborative process focused on identifying technologies and policies that can modernize its energy delivery system for increased sustainability and make it more reliable, efficient, cost-effective and interactive.", "In May, the process culminated in a final stakeholder report with 32 recommendations (i.e., more fundamental reforms that require further discussion) for consideration by the PSC related to data and information access and alignment, non-wire alternatives, rate design, utility business model reform, customer impacts, microgrids, and pilot projects.", "Net energy metering (NEM) has been successful in spurring the adoption of distributed generation across the country.", "As net metering-eligible resources continue to decline in price, the number of NEM customers has increased, which has led to pushback in many jurisdictions.", "Over the past couple of years, states have taken various approaches to successor tariffs to NEM, ranging from reductions in net metering rates for exported electricity to the development of regulatory structures to more precisely value and source services from DER (see #10, of last year’s Top 10).", "This year, one example of the holistic approach to NEM reconsideration can be found in Connecticut, where in June the Department of Energy and Environmental Protection (DEEP) and the Public Utilities Regulatory Authority (PURA) opened a proceeding to study the value of DER as required by Public Act 19-35.", "DEEP and PURA are required to submit a report on their findings to the General Assembly by July 2020.", "Other states, however, seem to be moving in a direction that is not favorable to future DER adoption.", "In January, the Louisiana Public Service Commission Staff proposed a rule that would compensate new net metering customers at avoided cost, rather than the retail rate, though also promising payment for any quantifiable locational, capacity-related, or environmental benefits.", "In April, Idaho Power filed a petition to suspend net metering service and explore modifications to the compensation structure under its net metering program, affecting customer-owned generation facilities with capacity up to 100 kW, even though existing net metered capacity represents just 0.15% of the utility’s summer peak demand of 3,400 MW.", "Idaho Power expressed concern that capacity under its net metering tariff had increased 114% in the first quarter of 2019 alone, driven by large commercial, industrial, and irrigation customers, with capacity from the irrigation class jumping from 1.09 MW to 5.06 MW.", "No decision has been made to date, but if the Public Utilities Commission sides with the utility, it could nip Idaho distributed generation in the bud.", "On a more positive note, New York recently made some landmark adjustments that should provide fairer treatment for customers that have significant distributed generation facilities.", "In April, the Commission issued an order that made revisions to the state’s DER value calculation and compensation methodology, and also adopted a new credit to encourage community distributed generation development.", "And in May, the Commission issued an order modifying the current standby and buyback service rates that will improve the alignment between system costs and how DER customers make use of the grid, which should ultimately improve the prospects for DER deployment.", "(For a more detailed look at this order, read more here.)", "Keep up-to-date on all regulatory action with AEE's PowerSuite.
