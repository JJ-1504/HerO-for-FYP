The largest contributor is an increase to Florida’s five-year outlook from 6.0 GWdc to 9.0 GWdc due to new solar procurement by Florida Power & Light (FPL), Duke Energy Florida, and other Florida utilities (most of which is utility self-build).", "This positions Florida to be the top state for utility PV over the next six years.", "Since last quarter, the 2019 forecast has grown by 1.2 GW, due largely to late project announcements in Texas that raised the state’s forecast by 720 MWdc.", "While the forecast for 2020 saw little change to overall expected capacity additions, over 10.0 GWdc of utility PV are still expected to come online that year.", "From 2021-2023, our utility PV forecast has increased by 2.8 GWdc. While the bulk of this increase is found in Florida, there are a growing number of utilities such as Xcel Energy, Idaho Power and PacifiCorp, among others, announcing additional solar procurement, expedited coal plant retirement, or plans to achieve 50% to 100% renewable or carbon-free energy targets, all of which have boosted the midterm forecast.", "During this time, utility PV also becomes increasingly competitive with wind. As the wind-focused federal Production Tax Credit steps down, solar begins to fall below the cost of wind on a levelized cost of energy (LCOE) basis in many traditional wind states such as Illinois, Iowa, Kansas, Michigan and the Dakotas by the mid-2020s.", "(Wood Mackenzie’s LCOE calculations for solar take the ITC incentive into account.) This is likely not only to drive more solar procurement in wind-dominant regions of Midcontinent Independent System Operator and Southwest Power Pool, but also to make solar the preferred renewable technology for corporate offtakers.", "Oklahoma Gas & Electric’s recent RFP for solar-plus-storage is the first example of what is likely to be a trend in solar procurement in the Prairies and Midwest.", "Our 2024 forecast has also increased by 1.1 GWdc.

Xcel could do more to advance toward the ultimate goal: delivering its customers more cost-effective clean energy by integrating hosting capacity analysis with the interconnection process.", "Xcel petitioned to, as mentioned in the Hosting Capacity Analysis report, “allow publicly posting additional information on CSGs in the interconnection queue, including feeder name, currently expected in-service date, and indicative interconnection cost.”", "ILSR supports the publication of this information, as an interest in greater transparency was raised in the October 2, 2020 convening of the Distributed Generation Working Group.", "Supporters agreed that the Company’s participation in greater inter-developer transparency could facilitate cost-sharing in line upgrades and would be an improvement from the current cost-causer pays model.", "It may also speed up the interconnection process; if developers can split an upgrade charge with other projects in the queue for that same feeder, they may be less likely to withdraw their application in the final stretch.", "We thank the Commission for approving the November 2, 2020 Petition To Publish Certain Information about Applications in the Interconnection Queue, as we believe it will improve the interconnection process.", "However, the interconnection process stands to gain much more from hosting capacity analysis.", "In the Commission’s July 2020 order, the Commission adopted “a long-term goal to use the hosting capacity analysis in the interconnection process’s fast track screens.”", "The Commission’s July 2020 Order also required the Company to study three additional objectives for hosting capacity analysis:", "- Remaining an early indicator of possible locations for interconnection;", "- Replacing or augmenting initial review screens and/or supplemental review in the interconnection process; and/or", "These objectives set the Commission’s intentions for hosting capacity analysis to, at the least, augment initial review screens and, at the most, totally automate interconnection studies.", "Xcel has since written “should the Commission determine it is in the public interest for the Company to advance and mature the HCA to be conducted more frequently and/or to integrate with the interconnection process,” the Company would refine cost and timing estimates.", "The Company continues to question the Commission’s intentions and displays a general lack of urgency in this matter.", "Integrating hosting capacity analysis with the interconnection process is not only possible, it is already being done.", "As part of changes to Rule 21, the California Public Utilities Commission is requiring utilities to use their Integration Capacity Analysis (equivalent to hosting capacity analysis) as part of the interconnection process.", "To similarly incorporate hosting capacity analysis into the Xcel interconnection process’s fast track screens would support the development of distributed energy resources in Minnesota by reducing costs and time for project development, and would direct project development to locations with existing grid capacity.", "ILSR asks that the Commission provide the Company more direction, in the form of deadlines to use HCA in initial or supplemental interconnection review (in the next 18-24 months) and automating at least a portion of interconnection proceedings (by 2025) as well as staff-facilitated working groups to guide implementation.", "California’s process to incorporate hosting capacity analysis into the interconnection process began in 2014, so we understand that this will take some time.", "However, if the Commission does not apply greater pressure for action, hosting capacity may continue to be a largely performative exercise without providing tangible benefits to Minnesota stakeholders and electric customers.", "Beyond the pending integration into interconnection, California utilities have additional features on their hosting capacity maps that ILSR believes should be implemented in Minnesota.", "Southern California Edison provides one such example of a more thorough hosting capacity map that includes criteria violation values.", "We are glad that the Commission has asked Xcel to provide all criteria threshold violations, rather than just the primary limiting factor.", "We ask that the Commission require Xcel Energy to provide these violations in the HCA map pop-ups (as requested by the Commission in the July 2020 order), rather than just in the sub-feeder Tabular Results.", "In summary, there are 5 things we ask of the Commission:", "- The Commission should accept Xcel Energy’s 2020 Hosting Capacity Analysis Report, but set more parameters around its implementation.", "- The Commission should, after considering stakeholder input in Docket No. E999/CI20-800, rule whether Xcel Energy must comply with Order Point 12 of the July 2020 order.", "If the Commission rules that Xcel must comply with Order Point 12, it should levy financial penalties if the Company does not comply.", "- The Commission should set a deadline and intermediate goals for the ultimate integration of hosting capacity analysis with the interconnection process.", "- The Commission should host staff-facilitated working group sessions on integrating hosting capacity analysis with the interconnection process.", "- The Commission should order Xcel Energy to publish all criteria violations on the HCA map.", "Thank you for the opportunity to comment and for taking up this important conversation; we appreciate that there has not been any legislative preemption of this regulatory process.", "This article originally posted at ilsr.org.

Released March 13, 2019", "In 2018, the U.S. solar market installed 10.6 gigawatts direct current (GWdc) of solar photovoltaic (PV) capacity, a 2% decline from capacity additions in 2017.", "After a year in which the residential sector experienced 15% contraction, 2018 marked a year of rebound as the residential market grew by 7%.", "Conversely, non-residential PV saw a slight annual decline of 8%. Utility solar also saw slight annual contraction, due to the impacts of Section 201 tariff uncertainty earlier in the year and shifting project timelines based on the tariff schedule.", "Overall, in 2018, solar PV has accounted for 29% of new electricity generating capacity additions – a lower share compared to 2017 due to a surge in new natural-gas plants in early 2018.", "After experiencing volume contraction last year, the residential solar market regained its footing in 2018 with steadily increasing installation volumes.", "The fourth quarter of 2018 was the largest quarter for the residential segment in two years. Five quarters of modest growth now suggest the market is adopting a more sustainable growth profile with a mix of local and regional installers operating alongside national installers.", "With 2018 in the books, a few key themes have emerged about the state of the residential solar market.", "Installation growth and market penetration levels suggest major states have moved past early adopters.", "Among the highest-penetration markets in the nation, residential growth rates were mixed in 2018. The one exception to this was Nevada, which experienced 3x growth once net metering was reinstated in 2017 after being revoked in 2016, which caused the market to contract by 61% from 2016 to 2017.This political turmoil led to abnormally high installations in 2018 based on pent-up demand.", "Outside the stabilizing large markets, growth in low-penetration emerging markets, such as Texas and Florida, continues to add to the geographic diversity of the residential market outside of California and the Northeast.", "Legacy markets are no longer the primary engines of growth. Though California is forecasted to be the largest market for the foreseeable future due to the sheer size of the state, the regional growth landscape began to shift and diversify in 2018.", "Of the top 10 markets in 2017, six markets experienced annual contraction in 2018 while two experienced double-digit percentage growth.", "Meanwhile, a handful of states are leapfrogging developed markets. Both Texas and Florida saw installations that surpassed legacy markets Maryland and Massachusetts last year, signaling new state-level leadership on residential solar development.", "In 2018, we saw a pivot away from legacy, incentive-driven markets and the emergence of low-penetration markets with limited third-party ownership options, good PV resources, and low electricity rates – a trend we expect to continue.", "Residential PV continues to be constrained by high costs of customer acquisition. Outside of overhead and margin, customer-acquisition costs remain the highest expense for installers of all sizes averaging 20% of the total system pricing.", "This reaffirms our view that at existing prices, sales and marketing is a vital part of continued residential market development.", "High customer-acquisition costs are directly related to high overall cost of installation, which also suggests a virtuous cycle of reduced costs.", "One target area for the industry to reduce costs is through streamlining the permitting and inspection processes, as permitting delays lead to customer attrition and other expenses.", "SEIA and the Solar Foundation, along with numerous companies, are working together to address these issues.", "New construction and roof replacement markets also represent an opportunity to address both customer-acquisition and permitting costs.", "However, at existing price levels, the high cost of customer-acquisition will slow growth in the near-term.", "Incentives and net metering remain important market enablers but show diminishing rates of return. While utility attempts to roll back net metering have been an issue in years past, this was not the case in 2018.", "No substantial revisions were made to residential NEM values in 2018 other than in Connecticut. In prior years, impending changes to NEM, other state-level incentives, or rate structures have created demand pull-in.", "Despite anticipated changes to incentives and NEM in 2019-2020, the major Northeast markets collectively saw no growth in installation volumes.", "This suggests that while changes to NEM policy and other incentives have greatly impacted growth in years past, 2018 marks a year of market maturation.", "While strong NEM policy remains an essential foundation for rooftop solar adoption, future growth across legacy markets will require technology and business-model innovation to tap into new customer demographics.", "Meanwhile, California’s new home solar mandate may signal the next phase of solar market adoption. The California Energy Commission’s decision in early 2018 to require solar PV on all new homes beginning in 2020 significantly insulates our long-term forecasts by adding an additional gigawatt of residential demand from 2020-2024E. While it remains to be seen whether other states will follow suit, some municipalities have created solar mandates for new buildings.", "Meanwhile, major national installers are spending considerable resources building relationships with housing developers to comply with California’s mandate while also aiming to capitalize on one-off housing developments outside of state mandates.", "With several newly announced entrants into the space, new home solar, whether mandated or voluntary, could provide an opportunity to bridge the cost of customer acquisition gap that has constrained growth.", "Unlike the case of residential PV, a handful of state-specific regulatory cliffs and policy reforms took effect in 2018, which led to a decline in non-residential build-out in the major markets of California and Massachusetts.", "Despite California’s market falling 17% year-over-year, the decline was not as severe as previously anticipated, as the extent of California’s pipeline of projects grandfathered in under solar-friendly time-of-use rates has been higher than previously assumed.", "However, Massachusetts witnessed 64% year-over-year decline in capacity installed as the industry awaited the start of the Solar Massachusetts Renewable Target (SMART) program.", "Combined, these two states saw a year-over-year decrease of more than 450 MW of installed non-residential PV capacity.", "New York bucked the national trend, experiencing record installations in 2018. This was the result of a waning pipeline of grandfathered remote net-metering projects becoming interconnected, despite being constructed in 2017.", "Meanwhile, community solar continues to support non-residential PV. Minnesota and Massachusetts contributed to well over 500 MW of community solar being installed this year.", "And while we won’t begin to see projects from New Jersey’s new community solar program until late 2019 at the earliest, the state is making significant strides in establishing the program, which technically kicks off in Q1 2019.", "Utility PV continues to hold the largest share of annual installations in the U.S. solar market with a total of 6.2 GWdc in 2018, accounting for 58% of total U.S. annual capacity additions.", "Lower-than-expected installation volumes in Q4 are primarily attributed to Section 201 module tariffs set in January 2018 and implemented in February 2018, which caused project sponsors to reassess a handful of project timelines and push out target commercial operation dates (CODs) from 2018 into 2019.", "In addition to tariff-related delays, interconnection delays for PURPA projects in the Carolinas contributed to lower-than-expected Q4 deployments.", "U.S. utility solar procurement has grown considerably with a number of utilities, such as Hawaiian Electric Company and Entergy Mississippi, announcing plans to add more utility PV to their generation portfolios due to the pure economic competitiveness of solar.", "In 2018, 13.2 GWdc of utility solar PPAs were signed, driving the contracted pipeline to 28.3 GWdc – the highest point in the history of U.S. solar.", "Most of these PPAs will be fulfilled with products imported after significant declines in the Section 201 tariffs.", "Voluntary procurement remains the largest driver of new PPAs signed and is expected to drive 51% of 2019 capacity additions.", "While commercial and industrial (C&I) off takers only accounted for 153 MW of actual capacity additions in 2018, C&I procurement drove 21% of all new PPAs signed last year.", "Meanwhile, new renewable portfolio standards are poised to drive additional utility PV.", "Many utility PV projects suffered disruption, delay and even cancelation due to the uncertainty leading up to the imposition of the Section 201 tariffs.", "The impacts can be seen in the volume of installations in 2018, which were down 7% year-over-year for utility-scale PV.", "However, since the tariffs were announced, the industry has pushed out timelines to account for the tariff stepdown schedule and has benefited from faster-than-expected declines in global module pricing.", "These price declines are mostly due to changes in China’s feed-in tariff policy that has resulted in a supply glut.", "While the Section 201 tariffs are still imposing a significant opportunity cost on the U.S. solar industry, new project procurement is moving forward thanks to strong industry fundamentals.", "Cell and module tariffs dropped from 30% to 25% in February 2019. Tariffs will drop to 20% in February 2020 and 15% in February 2021 before their scheduled expiration in February 2022.", "The International Trade Commission (ITC) will conduct a mid-term review of the tariffs starting in January 2020, at which point the President will have the opportunity to continue, modify, or terminate the tariffs.", "The ITC will begin data collection for that review this summer.", "Residential installation growth exceeded expectations for 2018, largely thanks to strong showings in California, Nevada and Florida.", "Still, as major state markets continue to grow past early-adopter consumers, higher costs of customer acquisition will challenge the industry to innovate.", "Long-term growth prospects benefit from (among other factors): geographic diversification outside of legacy state markets, California’s new home solar mandate, new incentive programs such as Illinois’ Adjustable Block Program, and technological/business model innovation to improve product offerings into solar-plus-storage.", "In 2018, the non-residential sector benefited from a large pipeline of projects grandfathered in under more favorable compensation policies in California and Massachusetts.", "California experienced commercial solar build-out in 2018, stemming from developers rushing to install projects to meet a (since-lifted) deadline to be grandfathered in under solar-friendly time-of-use rates.", "Meanwhile, New York saw its largest year ever for commercial installations as the remaining pipeline of remote net-metering projects came online.", "However, the delayed opening of the SMART program in Massachusetts resulted in that state seeing 325 MW less capacity installed in 2018 than in the record-breaking 2017.", "Additionally, the build-out of Xcel Energy’s robust community solar pipeline in Minnesota still accounts for a significant share of non-residential growth, with nearly 300 MWdc added in 2018.", "In total, Minnesota accounted for over 80% of the community solar build-out in 2018, while Massachusetts accounted for much of the remainder.", "Though the community solar market didn’t quite outpace 2017 capacity, last year marked the second consecutive year of over 500 MW of community solar installed.", "Utility PV continues to hold the largest share of annual installations in the U.S. solar market. In Q4 2018, 3.0 GWdc of utility PV capacity came online boosting the annual total to 6.2 GWdc in 2018.", "These additions represented 72% of total Q4 capacity and 58% of total U.S. capacity additions for the year.", "Lower-than-expected installation volumes in Q4 can be primarily attributed to two factors. The module tariffs set in January 2018 caused a handful of projects to reassess project timelines and push out target completed operation dates (CODs) from 2018 into 2019.", "Additionally, a handful of PURPA projects in the Carolinas have faced interconnection delays or have been outright canceled as utilities push back against standard rate agreements.", "U.S. utility solar market procurement has grown considerably, largely set for years when tariffs have decreased.", "Many utilities like Tennessee Valley Authority, Georgia Power and Northern Indiana Public Service Co., have announced plans to add more utility PV to their generation portfolios.", "With 13.2 GWdc of utility solar PPAs signed in 2018, the contracted pipeline peaked in Q3 2018 at 25.3 GWdc, the highest in the history of U.S. solar, and declined slightly in Q4 as project completion outpaced new PPAs signed.", "We employ a bottom-up modeling methodology to track and report national average PV system pricing for the major market segments.", "This methodology is based on tracked wholesale pricing of major solar components and data collected from interviews with major installers.", "Note: Detailed information about national system prices by market segment and component is available in the full report.", "In Q4 2018, system pricing fell in all market segments. Quarter-over-quarter, system pricing fell by 1.3%, 1.1%, 3.3% and 3.9% in the residential, non-residential, utility fixed-tilt and utility single-axis tracking markets, respectively.", "Prices across market segments are now all at historic lows despite tariffs on modules, inverters, aluminum and steel: $2.98/Wdc, $1.51/Wdc, $0.93/Wdc and $1.04/Wdc for residential, non-residential, utility fixed-tilt and utility single-axis tracking systems, respectively.", "Year-over-year system pricing fell by 4%, 8.5%, 15.1% and 14.4% in the residential, non-residential, utility fixed-tilt and utility single-axis tracking markets, respectively.", "Price declines continue to be led by declining hardware costs, with much of the reduction coming in module pricing.", "Cuts to demand in China last June created global module over-supply conditions that led to lower module prices, somewhat mitigating the impacts of module tariffs in the U.S.", "The tariffs still, however, impose an opportunity cost on the U.S. industry, which cannot fully take advantage of pricing available to the rest of the world.", "After modest decline in 2018, the national solar PV market will resume growth in 2019-2020, primarily driven by continued growth in the residential segment and a rebound in the utility PV sector.", "For utility PV, the downside to our 2018 forecasts benefits 2019 – the 2019 forecast has been increased from 7.2 GWdc to 7.8 GWdc as projects have pushed out target completion dates, and 2.1 GWdc of capacity is already under construction.", "The forecasts for 2020 and 2021 have increased to 10 and 10.4 GWdc, respectively. Of the projects announced in 2019, 68% have 2020 or 2021 target CODs, significantly boosting confidence in the near-term forecast.", "And we expect to see at least half of 2023 capacity additions leverage a 22% or higher ITC. Finally, growth will continue into 2024, driven by current utility IRPs for solar capacity along with the economic fundamentals of utility solar projects.", "After examining the risks of advanced procurement, many project developers now seem more open to anchoring projects in 2019 to claim the 30% ITC and bringing them online in 2021 or later.", "Still, several developers have suggested they will assess each project on a case-by-case basis.", "Commercial and industrial procurement is expected to remain a strong driver of utility solar over the next several years as the number of companies pledging to meet 100% renewables or zero-carbon targets increases.", "Renewable portfolio standards (RPSs) are also poised to see a resurgence as a driver of utility PV. Many of the newly elected governors are in states that have joined the U.S. Climate Alliance or campaigned on a pledge to join the Alliance and commit to the Paris Agreement in lieu of federal participation.", "Six of the governors have proposed increases to RPS targets, while three (Colorado, Nevada, and Illinois) have proposed 100% RPS mandates.", "This is in addition to California’s 100% RPS, Hawaii’s 100% RPS, and New York’s 50% RPS. If all states where elected governors campaigned on RPS increases were to achieve 50% RPS compliance by 2030, it could drive up to 37.0 GWdc of additional solar.", "Wood Mackenzie’s utility PV five-year forecast has increased 2.3 GWdc since our last report as more projects are announced, utilities include more solar in long-term resource planning, and development is driven increasingly by C&I offtakers.", "For residential PV, after seeing 7% growth in 2018, we expect flat to tempered growth in 2019, primarily due to major market maturation resulting in limited long-term growth opportunities in major Northeast markets.", "Meanwhile, the approval of a super off-peak rate in Southern California Edison territory – the second-largest utility in the nation for solar PV – takes effect in 2019, which severely limits the economic attractiveness of solar-only products.", "That said, growth resumes in 2020-2021 as the ITC step-down is expected to pull in demand in both legacy and emerging markets before declining in 2022.", "Growth resumes in 2023 and continues into 2024 based on economic fundamentals as the market adjusts to the post-ITC reality.", "In the long-term, residential capacity growth will be driven by California’s new home solar mandate – with upside potential from other states adopting similar mandates – a robust incentive program in Illinois, emerging markets like Texas and Florida becoming the new engines of retrofit growth, and the proliferation of solar-plus-storage.", "Meanwhile, the non-residential PV market is on track for another down year as the segment acclimates to a reduced incentive environment across major state markets in 2019.", "However, this will be incrementally offset starting in 2020 as the next wave of states with robust community solar mandates – New York, Maryland, Illinois and New Jersey – begin to see the realization of those pipelines.", "Increasing solar-plus-storage viability will also begin to have an impact on non-residential demand.", "By 2023, roughly 30% of non-residential PV will come from community solar, and ~20% will come from solar-plus-storage projects.", "By 2020, 28 states in the U.S. are expected to have 100+ MWdc annual solar markets, with 25 of those states being home to more than 1 GWdc of operating solar PV.", "This compares to only two states with 100+ MWdc annual solar markets in 2010.", "Forecast details by state (43 states plus Washington, D.C.) and market segment through 2024 are available in the full report.", "U.S. solar market insightÂ® is a quarterly publication of Wood Mackenzie Power & Renewables, Inc. d/b/a Greentech Media and the Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA)Â®.", "Each quarter, we collect granular data on the U.S. solar market from nearly 200 utilities, state agencies, installers and manufacturers.", "This data provides the backbone of this U.S. solar market insightÂ® report, in which we identify and analyze trends in U.S. solar demand, manufacturing and pricing by state and market segment.", "We also use this analysis to look forward and forecast demand over the next five years.

unimpeded, this trend will proceed indefinitely.", "Legislators and Regulators Should Be Wary of Establishing Performance Standards without a Foundation of Benchmarking Data", "Colorado’s GHG Roadmap endorses establishing performance standards for buildings, but also argues that requiring building owners to report their properties’ energy-use levels and emissions can help the state identify what sort of standards it should set.", "This current draft legislation, though, would immediately impose mandates for near-term and future energy-use reductions prior to having ever collected any statewide benchmarking data.", "The Roadmap specifically identifies the challenges of setting reduction targets without sufficient data:", "The immediate and persistent impacts of COVID-19 emphasize the critical need to ensure that new mandates don’t impose undue cost burdens.", "Many commercial property owners have endured reduced occupancy due to statewide restrictions upon in-person gathering, and many tenants, as they grow accustomed to increased reliance upon remote work or their businesses suffer privations through the ongoing recession, are also re-evaluating the amounts of office space they will require in the future.", "Since new costs imposed upon building owners are often borne by tenants, owners and tenants alike must be regarded as important stakeholders in these regulatory actions.", "Building Owners Want to Remain Competitive AND to Be Good Stewards of Our Environment", "Of the four sectors identified as major sources of emissions, the other three of which are transportation, utilities, and oil and gas production, the building sector presents a unique challenge for policymakers and regulators with objectives to reduce emissions.", "Regulating just the sale of vehicles with emissions standards, for example, still allows for an overall reduction in emissions within an aggressive timeline since the average lifespan of a vehicle is just 11 years.", "Though the move to reduce emissions from the electric grid will leave large generation assets stranded before the end of their useful lives, utilities are granted the authority to raise rates to cover the costs of new investments they make and to pay off assets no-longer-in-use.", "Buildings, conversely, are fixed assets which do not follow cycles of obsolescence like cars and cannot easily defray the costs of any new investment they undergo as utilities can.", "Where there are cost-effective technologies or behaviors which can reduce a building’s energy use, property owners are strongly incentivized to pursue them.", "Reducing energy costs is good for business; however, rules which force owners to make reductions greater than those the market allows them to make economically harm businesses.", "Sympathetic legislators and the drafters of Colorado’s Roadmap insist that the energy-use reductions they would like buildings to make will save their owners money, but, the way that this draft bill’s performance standards are written, some building operators will have much harder times than others finding solutions which return positive value on investment.", "Each covered building faces a unique path to compliance if the bill passes, and lawmakers should consider it essential to have more complete information to help establish the best path forward.", "Overview of Draft Bill’s Performance Standards and Penalties", "As of March 5th, this bill has not been formally introduced, so its provisions are subject potentially to change.", "Under its current letter, an owner of a covered building is required to report to the state his/her properties’ energy use, energy-use intensity, electricity demand, greenhouse-gas emissions, and Energy Star score.", "This initial requirement of the draft bill is similar to current requirements in Denver, Boulder and Ft. Collins, and does not pose significant compliance costs.", "This draft bill departs from existing benchmarking programs in the state by imposing specific performance standards, or, energy reduction mandates.", "The five conditions of compliance with these standards, as well as the legislation’s special cases and exemptions, are summarized in the table below:", "Covered buildings not exempted and out of compliance with these or the reporting standards are subject to monetary penalties.", "Every building required to report is also charged a small annual fee regardless of performance. The program’s fees and fines are summarized here:", "Impact Areas of Mandates Included in the Draft Benchmarking and Performance Standards Bill", "1. Mandates to Reduce Energy Demand Will Impose Unknown and Unequal Costs", "Reducing a building’s energy usage decreases its energy costs, but forcing high levels of reduction with the threat of penalties may cause many owners to make financially-unsound investments or simply relent and suffer fines.", "Much about the Cost to Reduce Emissions from Colorado’s Building Stock Remains Unknown", "No source yet exists with enough data about Colorado’s built environment to capacitate any to know what the true reach of a statewide benchmarking bill with performance standards would be.", "The draft bill calls for the creation of database of covered buildings to understand their energy uses and system designs, yet also imposes performance mandates despite not having the data available to properly estimate what those mandates will cost or whom they will affect.", "Some, especially poorly-run, buildings can more easily reduce demand cheaply; others may not have the systems by which to do so; the bill accounts for this to some degree, but there’s no authoritative indication of the populations of either basket.", "Even to the extent that local building counts exist, building-use provisions and exemptions in a benchmarking bill confound lawmakers’ abilities to understand the legislation’s impacts before the statewide database is compiled—in Douglas County, for example, the Assessor’s records show that 359 of the county’s 527,000 properties have gross floor areas at or above 50,000 ft2,[iii] but indefinitely many of these would be exempt from benchmarking and performance standards based upon their functions.", "It is not yet possible to estimate the true number of covered buildings in Douglas county (or all of Colorado, consequently), what their emissions or energy-use intensities are, or what it would cost them to comply with the draft bill’s performance standards.", "The Equipment Required for Energy-demand Reduction in Many Buildings Is Potentially Very Expensive", "Some building owners will be able to reduce their properties’ energy demands to compliant levels by making low- or no-cost changes.", "Others, though, may have to invest in expensive new equipment or advanced operations with no promise of ever reaping a positive return.", "Energy-demand reduction necessarily decreases a building’s periodic energy usage and costs, but those savings do not always swiftly cover the initial costs of the measures required to achieve them.", "A study conducted by the consulting firm McKinsey & Company identified many demand-reduction strategies with positive net present values for large buildings and the initial costs associated with enacting them—of these, the average initial cost is $4.40 for every million Btu of demand reduced.[iv] Initial costs this high could prove prohibitive to such a degree that some owners may prefer to swallow fines rather than spend so much in the short term, as indicated by one participant at an early stakeholder meeting for the draft bill, and some buildings may have to take measures which are not cost-effective in the long run, but less expensive than the fines.", "Even in cases in which owners can reduce energy demand cost-effectively, the costs of fitting buildings with new equipment and implementing new operational habits are not isolated.", "Energy-efficient equipment tends to be difficult to operate and many operators would require extensive re-training in order to handle it properly.", "On our recent survey of owners of large buildings in Colorado, 27% of respondents indicated that their properties could not meet the draft bill’s performance targets with investments that result in a positive return, and 19% expressed uncertainty.", "Several stated that the initial costs would be too great, and one commented that occupancy levels have been low enough recently (that is, during the pandemic) that spare financing is scarce.", "Others responded that they have already adopted all the strategies they could with positive present values.", "The way the draft benchmarking bill is written, these owners would not be credited for those investments.", "One claimed that “After already raising our Energy Star rating from 61 to 71 we have run out of projects to consider unless we completely re-engineer the entire mechanical plant.", "Past ROI analysis show an unrealistically long time frame no owner would accept [sic],” and also that making a large investment now or within the next decade would be unreasonable due to widespread vacancies beginning during the COVID-19 pandemic.", "Though 54% of respondents indicated that their buildings could achieve the targets, several of their comments speak to the challenges they would face.", "One respondent expressed optimism about reaching compliance by making positive investments, but worried that the payback periods of those investments may be effectively unreasonable.", "Two others specifically noted the challenges brought about by COVID-19. One wrote that “COVID has hit our building hard.", "We are focused on lowering [operating expenses] and leasing up our vacancies. We do not have the capital to support this type of mandate.”", "The other wrote that compliance would be possible, but that it “would cost a substantial amount to get going and complete the projects, buildings not in current position to do, especially with unknown of future tenants [sic].”", "Using Energy Star Scores as Performance Requirements Creates an Inconsistent Standard Over Time", "The foremost performance standards detailed in the draft bill are to be measured in Energy Star scores—Energy Star is a national program which ranks and scores America’s large buildings by their energy-efficiency percentiles within their peer groups.[v]", "Though requiring a minimum score of Colorado’s buildings would meaningfully recognize the achievements of those buildings which already operate to high standards of energy-efficiency, and most respondents to the CSI/CREA/Building Jobs 4 Colorado survey indicated that attaining the draft bill’s Energy Star 75 minimum is the easiest path to compliance, it is practically impossible for all large buildings in the state to maintain high scores.", "Because buildings, especially new ones, are tending to become more energy efficient as technology advances, high Energy Star scores are becoming increasingly difficult to maintain.", "This specific change to Energy Star scores will occur sometime this year as updates are made based on 2019 national building survey results, rather than 2012 survey results.", "A building with a compliant score in one period may reasonably operate to the same standard of energy-efficiency in the next and still fall out of favor because of the relative ease newer buildings have of operating cleanly.", "In this regard, an Energy Star score requirement especially burdens older buildings which already would be more difficult, and will become even more difficult still over the next several years, to coax into compliance.", "As one survey respondent commented, “it will become more difficult to maintain [a compliant score] as the Energy Star standards become more stringent over time and may become costly enough to move the ROI negatively.”", "Another noted that “We could continue to hit [Energy Star scores in the] 80's with changing nothing, but if they continue to make Energy Star harder, we'll have put a lot of dollars in which is not feasible [sic].”", "Furthermore, other states are also seeking to make their buildings more efficient; since Energy Star ratings are distributed on the basis of a national percentile, how can some buildings possibly comply, especially in the long run?", "2. Commercial Building Electrification Poses Significant Costs and Limited Emissions Benefits in the Near Term", "Though its prospects improve as years progress after 2030, forced building electrification at present would impose significant equipment and operational costs upon businesses and public utilities yet would not significantly reduce greenhouse-gas emissions.", "Efforts to Force Electrification Too Quickly Will Not Immediately Reduce Emissions", "The draft benchmarking and performance standard bill does not prescribe any manner by which the buildings it concerns must reduce their energy intensity, but since electric equipment, particularly electric heat pumps, can be less energy-intensive, some building owners may see electrification (the transfer of a building’s power generation from on-site fossil-fuel equipment to an off-site electric utility) as an option for pursuing compliance.", "The Colorado GHG Pollution Reduction Roadmap stresses that building electrification will be a persistent object of state policy, too; according to the Roadmap, “very high levels of electrification [will be] needed to achieve the 2050 [emissions] goals.”", "Building electrification is already becoming more popular as technology advances and electric grids become cleaner, but the Roadmap's recommendations are designed to accelerate the trend in pursuit of the state’s long-term reduction goals.", "If building owners are artificially encouraged to electrify their properties before the technology exists to make it holistically desirable, they may install equipment before their existing equipment ends their life cycles or which will swiftly become outdated as innovation progresses.", "In 2019, emissions generated by electric utilities produced between 263% and 303% more emissions per equivalent unit of energy than each of the three building sectors (residential, commercial, and industrial).[vi]", "Those numbers shrink to 0% and turn negative after 2030 given the policy scenarios in the Roadmap, but the differences are not very big for several more years.", "Full electrification can reduce emissions by 29.6%, 50.9%, and 35.6% in the residential, commercial, and industrial building sectors, respectively, by 2040, under Roadmap policy projections.", "The true cost of achieving that is unclear, however, and if Colorado’s built environment were to fully-electrify sooner, in 2021, the state’s total emissions would be about 39 MMT CO2e—almost 35%—higher than they’re expected to be otherwise (the actual effect would be somewhat less severe than that, since electric equipment is more end-use energy-efficient than fossil-fuel equipment).", "Accelerating electrification to that degree would be disastrous to the pursuit of Colorado’s economy-wide emissions targets.", "In the Short Term, Colorado’s Electrical Grid Can Not Handle a Rapid Influx of Electricity Demand without Causing Rates to Increase Dramatically", "Though a similar report does not exist regarding the conversion of commercial buildings, recent analysis by Xcel Energy, Colorado’s largest electric utility, shows the full electrification of the residential sector would cost $7,000 per home today—over 9% of the state’s median household income.", "That cost drops significantly through next decade to a projected $2,500 per home by 2030.[vii]", "This high short-term cost of swift electrification would result from the extensive upgrades and expansions that the electric grid would have to undergo in order to support it.", "Electrification moves peak electricity demand from summer to winter, which would force utilities to either overhaul their operations or endure regular blackouts.", "According to the same report by Xcel, \"with aggressive electrification, the electric system could shift to a winter peak in the 2030s, possibly earlier, and even before then, the electric system could require more than 4,000 megawatts of new capacity to cover the increased demand—more than a 50% increase in the system’s capacity.\"", "The investment required to equip the grid to handle all the new demand would, naturally, cause customers’ electric rates to skyrocket.", "If residential electrification becomes mandatory for new builds, Xcel Energy's natural gas customers would pay $66 (about 6%) more for the service, annually, by 2030.", "If electrification is mandated for all, including existing, residences, those same annual prices would increase by $930vii—almost 88%.", "Though additional research by Xcel has not been publicized, it follows that large-scale electrification of new and existing commercial buildings would increase these costs as well.", "This would be very burdensome to the people of Colorado, especially those most-harmed by the ongoing recession.", "Electric Retrofitting May Not Be Feasible, or May Be Too Costly, for Some Buildings", "Building electrification will become easier and less expensive over time, but, for now, it remains prohibitively expensive for some buildings and completely impossible for others.", "Some building uses are technologically easier to electrify than others (the requisite technology for agricultural and industrial electrification is many years off, for example), and cold-weather electric heating technology is still relatively infantile.", "According to Xcel, “the value proposition of electrifying...improves starting in the mid-2020s as commercially available electric technologies for space and water heating and other appliances become more efficient and as Xcel Energy’s electric system becomes less carbon intensive.\"", "Existing technology is not wholly sufficient to ensure the enduring efficacy of high-tech electrical equipment, so forced electrification imposes a high risk of equipment obsolescence upon compliant buildings.", "Operators unaccustomed to electric systems, additionally, will have to undergo potentially years of re-training in order to learn how to operate them efficiently.", "If building owners are artificially encouraged to electrify their properties before the technology exists to make it holistically desirable, they may install equipment which will swiftly become less initially expensive as innovation progresses.", "3. The Timing of the Draft Bill’s Performance Standards Is Dubious and the Administrative Costs are Unknown", "Buildings are getting cleaner, innovation is advancing, and the economical appeal of electrification is growing already—how large a sum is worth paying to accelerate those trends, and is now the right time to try?", "The Costs to the State and to Taxpayers of Such an Ambitious Program are Unclear", "The launching and continuity of the draft bill’s benchmarking and reporting program depend upon several daunting responsibilities that Colorado’s government stands to undertake.", "The state will be responsible for collecting and synthesizing an immense amount of data about Colorado’s built environment, creating and maintaining the reporting channels for buildings, interpreting countless reams of submitted data, enforcing compliance, auditing troublemakers, drafting new performance rules, and issuing and collecting fines for noncompliance; these together will require extensive labor and administration which taxpayers will have to fund.", "Energize Denver, a benchmarking program limited to Denver’s city limits and which does not enforce performance standards, cost $1.3m of public money in 2020;[viii] a statewide requirement which includes performance standards stands to cost much more than this.", "It is important that regulators understand and consider the costs as they decide whether and how to implement legislation.", "No fiscal cost estimate of the draft bill has yet been developed, and legislators should be wary of saddling taxpayers with indefinite costs.", "Building Benchmarking Alone Could Be Beneficial to the State Government and the Private Sector Before Regulators Set Performance Standards", "Because of the uncertainty of the costs of draft-bill compliance and the potentially-awkward timing of reduction mandates considering the short-term outlooks for electrification and demand-side management, a reasonable approach may be to gather information now through benchmarking, without the pressure of enforceable requirements, and delay imposing performance standards until the government understands Colorado’s building stock better and the electrical grid has had enough time to support an aggressive shift to electrification.", "A reporting requirement alone, in addition to providing regulators valuable information, can effectively heighten the environmental performances of buildings by forcing operators to gain thorough understandings of their buildings’ energy-use intensities and, thus, highlighting some ways by which they might reduce costly waste.", "In Denver, since the launch of Energize Denver’s benchmarking requirement, all building types except municipal and distribution (already the lowest-intensity category) have reduced their average energy-use intensity readings[ix]—owners who can definitively identify areas of opportunity for energy savings are easily motivated to act upon them.", "Without comprehensive data collected through reporting or some other means, understanding the aggregate economic impacts and net costs of this draft benchmarking bill is impossible—if businesses and ordinary taxpayers are to trust that such a program as this will not affect devastating unintended consequences upon some actors within the private sector, much more information ought to be presented.", "Once enough is understood about Colorado’s building sectors to begin developing reasonable performance standards, the guiding regulatory effort should be to prioritize targeting promising and cost-effective reductions and to avoid unintentionally penalizing buildings for outcomes out of their owners’ controls or the successes of others.", "Under the auspices of a prudent approach, buildings in Colorado can reduce their environmental impacts without overspending, and some may even benefit financially from it.", "A Survey of Commercial Building Owners and Operators Highlights Many of the Key Outstanding Questions and Concerns About How Mandates Will Impact their Businesses", "During the week of February 22th through February 26th, in coordination with Colorado Real Estate Alliance (CREA) and Building Jobs 4 Colorado, CSI conducted a survey to collect responses from large commercial building owners to better inform the understanding of potential impacts related to establishing emission and energy reduction mandates for covered properties.", "Energy-efficiency and emissions reductions are front-of-mind goals for any responsible building owner, both as good business decisions and as actions of responsible environmental stewardship.", "Though an effort to enforce the pursuit of these goals seems well-intentioned, closer evaluation finds that it can cause unpredictable and often devastating impacts.", "As there lacks much publicly available aggregate data about these issues, this survey was intended to gather that sort of information in a localized and qualitative, but hopefully informative, manner.", "The results displayed of questions 1 through 8 capture all survey respondents, and the featured responses to questions 9 through 11 were selected for completeness and insight from their respective pools of 108.", "All comments directly from survey respondents are presented unedited.", "[i] https://energyoffice.colorado.gov/climate-energy/ghg-pollution-reduction-roadmap", "[ii] Emissions data from Colorado’s GHG Inventory and E3;

In the last two years, the state has extended tax credits for buying EVs through 2025, adopted a zero emission vehicle standard that requires automobile manufacturers to increase the number of EVs they sell in Colorado, allocated VW emissions settlement funds to support EV charging and the acquisition of electric buses, trucks and school buses, and the legislature adopted Senate Bill 19-77, which allows and directs our investor owned electric utilities to support adoption of EVs.[1]", "Senate Bill 19-77 built on the recent growth of EV sales in Colorado—a doubling over the last three years—to ensure that emissions reductions, electric grid efficiency, consumer savings, equity and innovation result in tandem with vehicle adoption.", "In particular, the bill resulted in two changes.

Dannel Malloy signed a bill allowing state energy officials to modify Connecticut’s rules, thereby granting Dominion Energy permission to sell up to 75% of the output from its Millstone nuclear plant in a competitive solicitation with other zero-carbon resources.", "Earlier that month, lawmakers in Ohio introduced a bill to set up a zero-emission nuclear resource program designed to help the Davis-Besse and Perry nuclear plants remain viable.", "New Jersey policymakers held a hearing in December focused on strategies to prevent premature closure of its nuclear power plants, which could help the Salem and Hope Creek facilities.", "Oyster Creek (Figure 1), New Jersey’s other nuke plant, has already announced plans to retire in 2019.", "Pennsylvania legislators, too, are showing support for the nuclear and coal industries. Both houses in that state passed resolutions in October urging the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) to strongly consider the Department of Energy’s (DOE’s) Grid Resiliency Pricing Rule.", "Granted, the rule doesn’t need Pennsylvania’s blessing, but it indicates that the state could take further action, if the rule is ultimately rejected.", "In that proposed rulemaking, DOE directs FERC to impose rules on competitive power market operators to ensure that reliability and resilience attributes are “fully valued” for certain power generators.", "One of the required attributes in order to receive higher compensation is for the plant to maintain a 90-day onsite fuel supply, which means nuclear and coal-fired units would be the main beneficiaries.", "FERC was directed to take action by December 11, but new FERC Chairman Kevin McIntyre asked for, and was granted, a 30-day extension.", "In any case, coal and nuclear subsidies are likely to stay front and center in 2018.", "Energy storage is another segment that is likely to be top of mind for years to come. Storage is often viewed as an important component for renewable energy integration.", "It’s also an option in some areas for companies trying to alleviate grid congestion without investing heavily in new transmission infrastructure.", "Some countries, including Japan, Chile, and Mexico, have started requiring that new renewable energy projects be co-located with storage systems.", "According to a forecast published by Bloomberg New Energy Finance (BNEF), the global energy storage market is expected to grow to a cumulative 125-GW/305-GWh by 2030.", "To get there, an investment of about $103 billion would be required over the next 12 years.", "Eight countries are expected to account for the bulk of storage deployments, with the U.S. leading the way (see sidebar “Innovative Products Provide Opportunities for SRP”).", "Storage that provides system-level services, such as short-duration balancing or peaking capacity, is expected to account for much of the added capacity through the early 2020s, but behind-the-meter systems are expected to dominate in later years.", "By 2030, BNEF projects that 69-GW/157-GWh will be installed behind the meter, accounting for more than half of all storage capacity.", "Innovative Products Provide Opportunities for SRPMost power generation companies see change taking place all around them.", "Old, stodgy utilities are a thing of the past. Advanced technology and innovation are required to remain competitive in the future.", "Salt River Project (SRP) is one of the nation’s largest public power utilities, providing electricity to more than 1 million customers in Arizona.", "POWER asked SRP to respond to a few questions about the future and how it’s attempting to capitalize on market changes.", "Is there any technology that SRP is deploying in coming years that will be particularly useful and beneficial?", "SRP: One technology that we are exploring is the combination of solar and storage applications. We have recently executed an agreement with NextEra for a 10-MW utility-scale battery with four hours of storage capability paired with a 20-MW solar project to be located in Pinal County.", "This is a significant step forward and represents our commitment to maintaining our current diverse portfolio of generation technologies.", "We are also further investing in our interruptible demand response (DR) pilot. We have identified 6,000 residential customers for the program, which will target thermostat DR to determine if DR can be utilized as a dispatchable energy resource.", "How is the power company of the future going to be different from the power company of the past? SRP: The demands on the “power company of the future” from stakeholders have increased.", "Thus, the power company of the future will need to be more resilient in response. This means digital services and diverse product offerings that meet the unique needs of customer segments.", "Offering more opportunities to save and determine different levels of green energy. Is there anything that has SRP particularly concerned or especially hopeful about the future of power generation?", "SRP: We are hopeful about how Arizona and SRP are positioned for the future. We have made significant investments in power generation, including the recent acquisition of Gila River natural gas units, which will ensure continued reliability and low-cost energy for our customers for years to come.", "We will also be entering the [California Independent System Operator] Energy Imbalance Market in 2020, which will provide further benefit to our customers through power generation optimization.", "SRP’s strategy to be a leaner, greener, and more customer-centric organization is a winning proposition.", "The company is in its best financial position in years and has a dedicated, talented workforce ready to lead the industry into the future.", "Distributed generation (DG) comes in various forms including solar photovoltaic (PV), wind, microturbines, reciprocating engines, fuel cells, and gas turbines.", "Solar PV is the fastest growing segment (Figure 2).

But there is at least one potential roadblock on the horizon.", "“Right now, the production tax credit [PTC] for wind is set to expire at the end of 2019—solar moves into the earlier part of the decade,” said IRR’s Burt.", "“However, we have been hearing a lot in recent days here about bills before the Congress and the administration for tax reform.”", "Burt said that depending on what form the bill is passed in, the tax credits could be affected. The American Wind Energy Association (AWEA), an industry advocacy group, said the House proposal would derail the 2015 bipartisan-passed agreement to phase out the PTC over five years.", "“This proposal reneges on the tax reform deal that was already agreed to, and would impose a retroactive tax hike on an entire industry,” AWEA CEO Tom Kiernan said in a November 2 press release.", "That would be a big blow to planned wind power projects (see sidebar “Xcel Energy: Riding the Winds of Change”).", "Xcel Energy: Riding the Winds of ChangeIndustrial Info Resources, a provider of global market intelligence, estimates that during the 2018–2019 timeframe more money will be invested in North America on wind energy projects than on gas, coal, nuclear, and solar projects combined.", "One company that’s putting a lot of money into wind power is Xcel Energy, a Minneapolis, Minnesota-based electric and natural gas utility that serves customers in eight states.", "POWER posed a few questions to Steve Mills, Xcel Energy’s vice president of operations, to get his take on the future.", "What opportunities do you think offer the most promise for Xcel Energy? Mills: Xcel Energy is the nation’s No.1 utility wind energy provider, and we’re on pace to be the first utility in the nation to surpass 10 GW of wind on its system.", "We have owned wind generation since 2008, and we have developed key expertise in wind asset operations and maintenance skills over that time.", "Wind currently accounts for 19% of our energy mix; by 2021, we expect wind to supply nearly 35% of demand.", "Better technology is driving down the cost of wind, so it is a good value, even before factoring in tax credits.", "We expect our wind investments to save more than $1 billion in fuel and other costs. Xcel Energy is positioned well to successfully expand our renewable portfolio and provide a balanced energy mix for our customers.", "Is there any technology that Xcel Energy is deploying in coming years that you think will be particularly useful and beneficial?", "Mills: We have developed a very comprehensive wind forecasting tool to aid in optimizing our wind resources and dispatching fossil generation that directly benefits our customers with lower costs.", "In addition, unmanned aircraft systems, or drones, are improving the safety and efficiency of inspecting utility infrastructure.", "Xcel Energy has been among the leading utilities in drone research and development. Our program initially began inside our power plants, inspecting boilers and taking inventory.", "Currently, we have a partnership with the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) to inspect more than 20,000 miles of transmission lines in 10 states.", "Not only does this allow us to complete needed inspections, the program will provide feedback to the FAA as it develops safety protocols.", "Is there anything that has you particularly concerned or especially hopeful about the future of power generation?", "Mills: The utility industry hasn’t always been considered an innovative industry. Today, it is. Xcel Energy has pilot programs in many emerging technologies including electric vehicles, battery storage, smart meters, microgrids, and others.", "Utilities must understand their customers, develop processes and products quickly, and drive down costs.", "We can be hopeful about the future because the evolution of power generation is attracting new talent and fresh ideas.", "Change is driving new opportunities and Xcel Energy is well-positioned to be a change management leader in the utility industry of the future.", "Microgrids are also continuing to gain traction. In the U.S., the power grid is generally very reliable.", "However, when natural disasters such as a hurricane or wildfire strike, a microgrid could mean the difference between life and death.", "That may sound like an exaggeration, but when power is lost to critical services like hospitals and nursing homes, it really can be catastrophic.", "Of the microgrids currently installed, many are located on college and corporate campuses, prisons, and military bases (Figure 3).", "Often, they are interconnected to the local utility grid, but they maintain islanding capabilities in case of emergency.", "As prices decrease for equipment such as solar PV, battery storage, wind, and diesel or gas-fired backup systems, microgrids will undoubtedly grow in popularity, especially in remote locations (see “Collaboration and Innovation Produce a Powerful Microgrid Solution” in the August 2017 issue).", "For power generators, the future will likely bring more advanced technology. Artificial intelligence is already starting to make its way into power plants, and computers are identifying problems well before skilled operators could realistically be expected to detect anomalies.", "Sensors, data historians, and a range of digital tools have been in place at power plants for decades, but new technology is analyzing the data and acting on the findings.", "Many plants have leveraged past investments in technology, incorporating predictive software and reaping benefits that include enhanced productivity, cost savings, improved worker safety, and more efficient operations and maintenance.", "And that’s what it’s all about, operating plants in a way that keeps them competitive and in the market.", "That’s good for customers and good for the power company.

And this week, the company announced it will be fast-tracking the retirement of its two remaining coal-burning power plants, which are in Minnesota, by 2030.", "So make no mistake: This is industry-shaking news. Here’s our explainer, first published December 5.", "Greater ambition is in Xcel’s political and economic interests", "Xcel has been a leader on clean energy for a while. According to the company, it has reduced its carbon emissions by 35 percent since 2005.", "Earlier in 2018, it announced plans to, by 2030, reduce carbon emissions 60 percent (from 2005 levels), increase the level of renewable energy in its fleet to 55 percent, and shut down 50 percent of its coal capacity — in the state of Colorado.", "Those goals were enough to win the company Utility Dive’s Utility of the Year Award for 2018.", "But the new goals go much farther. And they cover Xcel’s entire eight-state territory.", "So what pushed the company’s ambition so much higher?", "First, renewables are getting really cheap. In its recent solicitations, Xcel has gotten more bids for renewables, with more variety, for much cheaper.", "Wind and solar plants paired with storage are bidding in cheaper than the ongoing operating costs of existing coal plants.", "Renewables are even giving natural gas a run for its money.", "Second, Xcel’s customers — particularly cities — are demanding it. “When your customers are asking for this over and over,” Fowke said when announcing the news, “you really do listen.", "Boulder, the city of Denver, Breckenridge ... Pueblo, they’re considered or they have already decided that they want to pursue 100 percent renewable.”", "Remember that, because it’s important in an age of no federal climate policy: Cities can move utilities, and utilities can move the energy industry.", "Third, the political landscape is shifting. Democrats took the governor’s mansion in Colorado, Michigan, New Mexico, and Wisconsin.", "In Colorado and New Mexico, they now have a “trifecta” — governor and both legislative houses. Running for governor in Colorado, Jared Polis supported a new renewable energy standard of 100 percent by 2040; with Democratic majorities in the state legislature, he might get it passed.", "Renewables are on the rise in the West, popular with politicians, cities, corporations, and ordinary ratepayers.", "It is to Xcel’s benefit to get ahead of the curve and give the people what they want.", "Fourth, Xcel would very much like to build more stuff.", "It is a vertically integrated monopoly. The areas in which it operates have not been “restructured,” i.e., generation has not been split off from transmission and distribution.", "Regulated monopoly utilities, as I’ve explained in previous stories, do not make money on the power they sell or the fuel they buy.", "They make money by drawing a rate of return on investments in power infrastructure. These “rate-based” investments are the utility’s bread and butter.", "In a broad sense, the shift to renewables is good for such utilities. When they shift from existing fossil fuel plants to new renewable energy, they shift from fuel (coal and natural gas) costs, which they make no money on, to investments in new renewable energy power plants, new batteries to store power and electric car chargers to help electrify the vehicle fleet, and tons of new transmission lines, much of which they can rate-base.", "These goals (perhaps combined with a new, more stringent RPS in Colorado) will help Xcel get permission from regulators to depreciate lots of uneconomic old fossil-fuel assets (which activists have been hassling it about anyway) and build, build, build a bunch of new stuff.", "In short, Xcel stands to profit handsomely, and benefit politically, by giving its customers the clean energy they want.", "(Many ratepayer advocates worry that utilities like Duke are taking advantage of this dynamic, using clean energy as an excuse to build stuff that local, distributed energy could handle better — but that’s a different post.)", "A more interesting question is how this might affect Xcel’s monopoly status. On one hand, riding a political wave as a climate champion allows it to stay ahead of grumbling or desire for restructuring.", "On the other hand, Xcel suddenly needing so much clean energy might help grease the skids for regionalization, i.e., the creation of a restructured Western wholesale power market run by a regional transmission operator (RTO).", "If all of the West is heading toward decarbonization together, the region’s utilities will need to pool their resources.", "In fact, they might need to pool their resources rapidly, because the federal tax credits for wind and solar power are set to expire soon.", "Buying a lot of capacity before then could save a lot of money.", "Fifth — and this may be somewhat peripheral, but it’s interesting — on the very same day Xcel made its announcement, the Boulder City Council voted to move forward with creating a municipal utility and breaking off from Xcel.", "Xcel very much opposes that move. By ramping up its clean energy goals, it may not keep Boulder, but it could dissuade other similar-minded cities from following Boulder out the door.", "Anyway, the decision to go carbon-free by 2050 is not a selfless act on Xcel’s part — it sees which way the wind is blowing and is focused on providing returns for shareholders.", "And the announcement leaves many, many details unspecified, including plans to shut down fossil fuel plants and transition plans for affected communities.", "Nonetheless, it shows that incentives are beginning to align in a hopeful way. It is the smart move, politically and economically, for Xcel to set a course for zero carbon.", "That would have been unthinkable 10 or even five years ago.", "A few other aspects of this story are worth highlighting.", "Xcel explicitly did not promise 100 percent renewable electricity. It promised 100 percent carbon-free electricity.", "In this, it echoed California’s recent bill SB 100, which committed the state to 100 percent carbon-free energy by 2045.", "The difference is that carbon-free includes not only renewables but also advanced nuclear power plants and fossil fuel power plants with carbon capture and sequestration, either of which Xcel may end up needing to get to 100.", "The company believes that its 2030 goal can be achieved affordably with renewable energy and other technologies currently available.", "However, achieving the long-term vision of zero-carbon electricity requires technologies that are not cost effective or commercially available today.", "That is why Xcel Energy is committed to ongoing work to develop advanced technologies while putting the necessary policies in place to achieve this transition.", "Both sides of this message are incredibly important and poorly understood by the general public.", "First, we have a really good idea of how to get to 80 percent. Climate researcher Christopher Clack and his team showed in 2016 that the entire US could get to 80 percent using existing commercial technologies.", "We know we can get to 80, but 80 is a long, long way off almost everywhere. There is, in other words, no reason to wait.", "And second, we’re not yet sure how to get that last 20 percent, so we need to keep researching new techniques and technologies in the meantime.", "Xcel is going to work with state regulators to try to do some ratepayer-supported R&D. That seems like a really good idea.", "Targeting zero carbon before we know exactly how to achieve it is the kind of aspirational courage that will very much be needed if the US ever gets anything like a Green New Deal.", "A final side note here: Xcel runs two nuclear plants in Minnesota, which provide almost 30 percent of Xcel power in the Upper Midwest.", "Their licenses will be up around 2030. It’s very likely that to stay on track for its carbon targets, Xcel will need to keep those plants running for longer than that.", "Math like this is what has driven a substantial recent shift in opinion among greens about the wisdom of keeping existing nuclear plants open.", "Somewhat by coincidence, the same day Xcel made its announcement, A.P. Moller-Maersk, the world’s largest shipping container company, announced that it will target carbon neutrality by 2050, though, it said, “carbon neutral vessels must be commercially viable by 2030, and an acceleration in new innovations and adaption of new technology is required.”", "This came on the heels, last month, of Google’s announcement that it would strive to run all its operations on 100 percent clean energy, at all times, around the clock.", "There are now hundreds of companies (Ikea, Apple, BMW, Coca-Cola, Facebook, etc.), more than 90 US cities (Minneapolis, Denver, St. Louis, Atlanta, Salt Lake City, etc.), and two US states (Hawaii and California) committed to reaching 100 percent clean electricity.", "This is how the real target — zero net carbon — will arrive in the US: not in a blinding flash or a big federal bill (at least not at first), but like a virus or a meme, catching hold and spreading through contact.", "Researchers have found that both rooftop solar panels and electric vehicles are contagious. People are more likely to buy them when they see other people buying them.", "Human beings are social creatures, not autonomous utility maximizers. We don’t reason through our purchases and our lifestyles; we generally adopt what’s around us and do what people like us do.", "The very same is true of urban policy makers, corporate officers, utility executives, and state regulators.", "You can show them all the charts and graphs you want — until they see others like them doing these things, they won’t feel confident.", "Now more and more people are doing it, and more and more people are seeing other people doing it. The virus is spreading.", "With Xcel and Platte River Power Authority’s news commitments, the virus has spread into the utility industry."]}

This has been true in Xcel Energy’s IRPs in the past; community input has been limited to those local governments that are host to a utility generating plant or organizations with the resources to participate.", "This is a problem because utility resource planning determines where customers’ electricity will come from over the next decade, and therefore how much pollution and energy costs might be shouldered by communities already overburdened by both.", "IMT’s work on the Xcel IRP was part of the broader Bloomberg American Cities Climate Challenge effort to help develop comments on behalf of the City of Minneapolis in the Xcel Energy’s IRP.", "These comments center equity by both including and amplifying the perspectives of local environmental justice and community-based organizations, as well as recommending ways that the utility might consider the equity impacts of their past and future resource decisions.", "In the past, comments from Minneapolis or other cities have been fairly minimal, but these comments provided detailed technical analysis for how the utility could retire their fossil fuel plants sooner, use a clean energy portfolio to meet future demand, model more

Engagement Coalitions are a Powerful Way to Participate in the Process", "Capacity is a primary barrier to participation in the utility regulatory process, for both local governments and community

Gov. Mandela Barnes, Public Service Commission Chairperson Becky Cameron Valcq and Department of Natural Resources Secretary-designee Preston Cole.", "With this order, clean energy becomes again a policy priority, advanced to not only bolster the state’s economy and protect its natural resources, but also promote the health and well-being of its citizenry.", "What’s also notable about Evers’ initiative is the degree to which it is grounded in climate science.", "The order frames climate change as an escalating environmental problem that is already doing harm to the state on several fronts.", "An effective response from state government, therefore, demands aggressive and sustained action. Moving to carbon-free electricity by 2050 certainly qualifies on that score.", "Now, an executive order is not the same thing as a law. Executive orders carry no legal weight, which explains why they are narrowly drawn to address matters that are totally within a governor’s control, such as agency priorities.", "Moreover, they are not binding on future governors and their administrations. That said, we are hopeful that the clean energy actions taken today by this Administration will cultivate, over time, buy-in from state legislators, and that from this order will emerge comprehensive, forward-looking policies that will put Wisconsin on track to becoming a renewable energy leader.", "As audacious as it may appear, Evers’ clean energy goal is actually in line with recent utility commitments to decarbonizing their generation mix.", "Whether set at 80% or at 100% by 2050, the level of carbon reductions that Wisconsin electric providers have publicly embraced are ambitious, when compared with current levels.", "In 2018, the percentage of renewable and nuclear generation combined, relative to total sales, was approximately 25%.", "We’ll probably need to quadruple today’s volume of carbon-free electricity, depending on how much energy efficiency reduces our consumption compared with how much transportation and other direct uses of fossil fuels become electrified by 2050.", "No matter what happens, this transition will require a concerted and sustained push on the part of every electric provider.", "Fortunately for the state’s utilities, there has never been a more propitious time to invest in carbon-free electricity, especially from wind and solar plants, than right now.", "The capital costs of new wind and solar farms are at their all-time lows, and their operating costs are a fraction of what it costs to buy the fuel for coal and natural gas plants operating today.", "The signs that utilities are seizing this opportunity are multiplying. As they move to permanently shutter older and less efficient coal- and natural gas-fired generators, Wisconsin power providers are either busy purchasing more renewable electricity from new plants or building more solar and wind farms for themselves.", "In the week following Governor Evers’ Executive Order, ground was broken for the Two Creeks plant, one of the two large solar plants owned by Madison Gas and Electric and WEC Energy.", "Located a mile from the Point Beach Nuclear Power Plant, this 800-acre solar farm will, by itself, more than double existing solar capacity when completed next year, from 120 megawatts (MW, measured in AC or alternating current) to 270 MW.", "That total will more than double again when the 300 MW Badger Hollow solar farm, located in Iowa County, becomes fully operational at the end of 2021.", "And other Wisconsin utilities, WPPI Energy and Dairyland Power, have signed power purchase agreements from 249 additional megawatts of solar from two projects, both of which are now seeking approval from the Public Service Commission and could also be built in 2020-2021.", "Solar farms deliver far more value to the public and the planet than simply megawatt-hours of electricity produced and tons of carbon dioxide avoided.", "There are also the jobs that go into the construction of these arrays, the revenues that allow farmers to keep farming their land, revenue payments to local governments that host the projects, and the rich habitat for pollinators and wildlife that is created as the soil recharges.", "Harnessing solar energy for productive purposes has been and will continue to be integral to Wisconsin agriculture.", "To put an exclamation mark on the last point, one of the most productive actors on the American agriculture scene—LaFarge-based Organic Valley Cooperative—financed the construction of two smaller solar farms in western Wisconsin.", "These two arrays—one in Arcadia and the other in Cashton—were energized last month and are now sending power into the grid.", "That new increment of renewable electricity, when added to Organic Valley’s previous investments in solar and wind power, will enable the cooperative to offset 100% of its electricity use from zero-carbon, renewable sources.", "Organic Valley is the largest U.S. food brand to have accomplished that feat.", "Organic Valley is the second Wisconsin enterprise to achieve a 100% renewable electricity goal. The first was La Crosse-based Gundersen Health System, which achieved that milestone five years ago through a combination of intensive efficiency measures and small-scale renewable power projects, usually off-site.", "In addition to reducing its energy overhead and passing the savings along to the people it serves, Gundersen wanted also to lead by example, demonstrating to the health care industry that sustainable energy is “healthy, socially responsible and economically beneficial.”", "It is not unrealistic to expect that, in the next 10 years, hundreds of businesses and local governments will manage to achieve the same feat pioneered by Gundersen and Organic Valley.", "When Gundersen pursued energy efficiency to reduce its energy overhead and generate carbon-free electricity as offsets, it had to settle on a path that effectively bypassed the electric providers serving their facilities.", "But some utilities are no longer content to stand on the sidelines while their customers sponsor new clean energy generation by their own initiative.", "Newer services such as shared solar and renewable energy sleeve tariffs enable self-selecting customers and utilities to partner on new clean power projects.", "For example, Xcel Energy’s Solar*Connect Community program has been particularly successful in eliciting customer subscriptions to purchase electricity produced from new solar arrays in western Wisconsin.", "While there is an up-front cost to this service, the price of solar power is fixed, and may over time become less expensive than standard electricity, depending on the size and frequency of future rate increases.", "It’s worth noting that this is not a required service in Wisconsin, and therefore many residents and businesses here do not have access to a utility-provided shared solar service.", "Expanding shared solar throughout the state would allow more residents and businesses to benefit from the clean energy evolution.", "Back in 2006, when Wisconsin’s renewable energy standard was raised to its current level, wind power was poised to become the workhorse of the renewable electricity world.", "It did become so in several states, among them Texas and Iowa. But while wind power supplies 16% of Texas’ electricity and nearly 40% of Iowa’s power, Wisconsin’s rancorous siting and permitting climate has severely hobbled wind’s growth here since 2011.", "Right now, wind accounts for about 2.5% of electricity produced in the Badger State. Wisconsin utilities own, or buy power from, wind farms in other states which, if included, brings the total amount of wind being credited to Wisconsin customers to about 7% of the state’s electricity consumption.", "Wind development activity is beginning to rebound, however, especially in the southwestern part of the state.", "But it will need to spread beyond the small pockets of the state where the current population of wind farms now operate.", "With capital costs going down and turbine productivity going up, wind development can occur cost-effectively over a wider swath of Wisconsin than what was considered suitable 10 years ago.", "And why not include Lake Michigan among the areas that can host tomorrow’s wind farms? Engineering advances and improvements in foundation design make offshore wind power in waters deeper than 100 feet a feasible option.", "The ripple effects through the eastern Wisconsin economy would be substantial, especially for companies that manufacture cranes and marine construction vessels.", "Offshore wind can happen here with the right leadership.", "But while the picture for wind power going forward remains uncertain, it’s all systems go for solar power.", "What is now an affordable resource for power providers is also an equally attractive option for electricity customers of all sizes, classes, and groupings, whether the solar array is dedicated to one home or business or to a school district or local government.", "Partnerships forming around solar energy are multiplying across the state and much of the nation.", "Customer-sited generation growing, but needs to be unleashed", "From 2013 to 2018, customer-sited generation was the primary bright spot in Wisconsin’s renewable energy landscape.", "Customer-sited solar grew from 17 megawatts in 2013 to about 80 megawatts by year-end 2018, and the market continues to grow as the cost of installing solar power has declined.", "Initiatives like our Solar for Good and Faith & Solar programs have made solar power an affordable option for more than 40 nonprofits across Wisconsin, with 30 more working on projects this year.", "But we know there are speed bumps, and it’s past time to fix them. The 20 kilowatt net metering threshold set by most of Wisconsin’s utilities often and unnecessarily limits the ability of customers, especially larger businesses and nonprofits, to supply themselves with renewable power.", "Generators that exceed the net metering threshold are penalized for exporting power to the grid.", "This situation has especially been hard on Wisconsin’s biogas generators. After their initial contracts expire, biogas generators face the prospect of a 60% reduction in revenue flow.", "Many have already stopped generating electricity as a result, and are now flaring biogas instead.", "With Wisconsin utilities now clearly moving towards building renewable power and retiring coal plants, it’s time to equalize the treatment of customer-sited renewable generators relative to large solar farms.", "If utilities need more daytime power capacity, they should credit distributed generators like solar and biodigesters at the same level that is accorded to their own renewable power plants.", "Our net metering rules need to be strengthened to capture more of the great potential and benefits that we know distributed generation brings to Wisconsin.", "It’s also time to enable financing of clean energy systems, such as third-party leases and power purchase agreements, so that more low- and moderate-income Wisconsinites can take advantage of “pay as you go” solar energy financing options which are commonly available in more than half of the United States.", "A particularly powerful example of solar partnerships can be found in the Ashland-Washburn-Bayfield area.", "Operating on a shoestring over its four-year history, Cheq Bay Renewables, an all-volunteer organization, has designed and developed several community-scale projects notable for their affordability and popularity.", "One of these is a solar group buy program, now in its second year, that has yielded nearly one megawatt of new capacity serving area homes, farms, and small businesses.", "Supported initially by a $10,000 Solar in Your Community Challenge grant from U.S. Department of Energy (USDOE), the organization’s latest venture is set to deliver more than a dozen solar systems to schools, county-administered housing, wastewater treatment plants, and other public facilities in the Washburn-Bayfield area.", "Cheq Bay’s next project after that will put solar systems on three tribal buildings serving the Bad River Band of Lake Superior Tribe of Chippewa Indians.", "Half the funding for Bad River’s solar systems will come from U.S. DOE.", "Through a combination of creativity, resourcefulness, and hard work, Cheq Bay Renewables has been the catalyst for the renewable energy transformation occurring in northern Wisconsin.", "Though the progress it has made thus far is nothing short of amazing, it wouldn’t be happening without all the partnerships that Cheq Bay has meticulously cultivated with local governments, federal and state agencies, electric providers, and sustainable energy professionals.", "Partnerships like these are essential for getting the job done. And Executive Order 38 sets the stage for a new round of partnerships and collaboration to achieve the bold vision for Wisconsin’s clean energy future that Governor Evers and his Administration now embrace.", "From what’s happening on the ground, we know many initiatives are delivering results today, and these bright spots will be the foundation to creating a statewide clean energy success story."]}

It was Wehrum, in his role as a coal lawyer, who argued in court against standards to protect miners and construction workers from dangerous silica dust, which can lead to silicosis and other respiratory diseases.40 Instead of investing in communities and worker transitions in the wake of plant closures, Trump’s first budget proposed eliminating the Appalachian Regional Commission and cutting other economic development and worker training projects in coal country.41", "And then there’s the Trump administration’s repeated efforts to repeal the Affordable Care Act, which would have had a devastating effect on Appalachia.", "One analysis found that 670,000 people would have lost insurance in West Virginia and Kentucky alone and more than 70,000 jobs would have been eliminated.42", "Likewise, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) from the coal state of Kentucky has also failed to support worker benefits, despite his state employing more than 6,000 miners, including his continued refusal to fully fund miners’ pensions.43 The Miners Pension Protection Act, which would transfer additional funding to the miners’ pension fund to keep it solvent and ensure healthcare for retired miners,44 has been introduced four times since 2015.", "Setting a target for greenhouse gas emission reductions is an act of leadership that relies on consideration of a combination of policy principles, available models, data, and feasibility.", "Failing to set a sufficiently ambitious interim target would fail to inspire the scope of changes needed, necessitate ever steeper reductions in later years, and magnify the damages of climate change.", "No target will be effective, however, if it pushes emissions-intensive agriculture and industry overseas (harming both the U.S. economy and global emissions) or provokes a political backlash that reverses policy changes.", "People of all communities need to see the benefits of climate action in their own lives and have a voice in shaping their future.", "Those benefits extend beyond just the avoided disruption of climate change to include good jobs, clean water, and justice for the communities of color, tribal communities, and low-income communities that have lived with the cumulative impacts of decades of toxic pollution.", "As state-level and international examples illustrate, failing to center policy on the needs of workers and communities will undermine popular support for climate action, may even create backlash, and ultimately slow progress toward net-zero emissions.", "For this report, the Center for American Progress synthesizes existing literature and modeling and evaluates the combined effect of various policies against a target of at least a 43 percent46 reduction below 2005 levels in greenhouse gas emissions by 2030 and net-zero emissions no later than 2050.", "This is based on the interquartile range for cutting carbon dioxide emissions identified by the IPCC report on 1.5 degrees Celsius, restating the equivalent reduction against 2005 levels rather than 2010 levels, and also adding in all other greenhouse gas emissions.", "The 2030 and 2050 targets identified in this report are extraordinarily ambitious, requiring reduction of emissions at a rate that is four times faster than the annual rate of reductions achieved between 2005 and 2017.47 Achieving these targets will require a new set of policy principles.", "These are the 10 principles that underpin CAP’s recommendations:", "- The goal is net-zero economywide emissions no later than 2050.

But under WTO rules, a trade-related environmental measure could be excepted from General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) rules if the measure is “necessary for the protection of human, animal or plant life or health.”", "Buy local programs can demonstrate to domestic stakeholders the local benefits of the energy transformations required to counter climate change.", "Interestingly, the United States filed and won a WTO case in 2016 against India for a buy local solar initiative.245 The United States should partner with India to seek an overall change in WTO treatment on this issue.", "- Border Adjustment Tariff (BAT). As policymakers consider measures, such as carbon fees, to spur domestic greenhouse gas reductions, BAT mechanisms have moved to the forefront of policy options to help protect U.S. jobs and economic competitiveness.", "In addition to ensuring that a price on carbon will not push carbon-intensive activities to less regulated markets, many see a BAT also as a potential tool to motivate trading partners to strengthen their domestic climate performance.", "In order to simplify administration and maintain consistency with existing WTO rules, an effective BAT can be designed to cover just more than 40 energy-intensive, trade-exposed (EITE) sectors (for example, steel, aluminum, chemicals, glass, paper) that comprise 50 percent of total U.S. manufacturing emissions and 6 percent of manufacturing employment, according to a 2009 EPA analysis.246 New EU Commission President Ursula von der Layen has called for the EU to implement a BAT system in tandem with the EU raising its emissions reduction ambition.247 Early U.S.-EU coordination to harmonize a seamless system of carbon price border adjustments could smooth trade flows between these two major trade markets and drive climate action in all other countries.248", "- Global clean production certification system. The United States and other leading medium and heavy industry countries should partner to launch a global forum to create a taxonomy of clean energy production standards and an accompanying voluntary certification system for high carbon-intensity products.", "Such a certification and labeling system could incentivize improved production practices in domestic and foreign manufacturing sectors.", "The Energy Star program offers an interesting model. Once the certification system is sufficiently robust and global capacity for clean production has developed, the United States could graduate to a trade or procurement regime based on law or regulation.", "- Use trade to combat deforestation. A new administration and Congress should determine how the United States should use trade policy to incentivize sustainable land use practices and counter alarming deforestation trends in hotspots such as the Amazon and Southeast Asia.", "Policymakers could look to the Lacey Act and EU trade agreements as potential models.249", "- Climate standards in U.S. bilateral trade agreements. A new administration should stipulate that all U.S. trade agreements—bilateral and multilateral—include environmental, climate, and labor standards, which would be effectively enforceable, rather than their current status as side agreement matters.", "- Climate performance criteria in foreign direct investment (FDI). Similar to the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) review process, Congress should provide new authorities to condition U.S. approval of potential FDI transactions into the United States against a standard for an investing party’s climate performance in its broader investment activities.", "In addition, the United States should prohibit any foreign investments on climate damaging projects or acquisitions in the United States.", "Investment limitations would be a strong and controversial instrument but would send an unequivocal signal of the need for immediate emission reductions.", "CFIUS-like review would likely prompt potential investors to change behavior.", "- Fossil fuel subsidy reform. The Trump administration has turned its back on seeking the elimination of fossil fuel subsidies, one of the most effective means to drive down greenhouse gas emissions and level the competitive field for noncarbon energy sources.", "The IMF estimates that worldwide energy subsidies in 2015 totaled $4.7 trillion (6.3 percent of world GDP).250", "If governments set fuel prices at fully efficient levels, global CO2 emissions would have been 28 percent lower, fossil fuel air pollution deaths 46 percent lower, revenues higher by 3.8 percent of global GDP, and net economic benefits (environmental benefits less economic costs) would have amounted to 1.7 percent of global GDP.", "The new administration should reengage both on the domestic and international fronts, specifically under the G-20 and Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) in their respective fossil fuel subsidy reform initiatives.251", "The World Bank estimates the world will need to spend up to $90 trillion from 2015 to 2030 in order to replace ageing infrastructure in advanced economies and to accommodate higher growth and structural change in emerging market and developing countries.252", "Public finance can play a catalyzing role, but private-sector finance will be the key to meet the scale of the finance challenge.", "The United States has a disproportionate influence over how private-sector finance will contribute, both through domestic regulations and influence over international financial institutions.", "There are several policies that could better unlock finance for climate change projects worldwide.", "- Integrate climate into corporate financial governance. Trump’s climate denialism is creating a dangerous blind spot for the U.S. financial sector, irresponsibly putting U.S. companies, workers, and investors at risk.", "One concrete step would be for the Federal Reserve to join the Network on Greening the Financial System (NGFS), a network of central banks and supervisors that are driving improved climate risk management within their financial sectors.", "An increased Fed role on climate would catalyze climate risk assessment and management throughout the U.S. financial sector and could shape market incentives to channel investment to climate-related opportunities.", "In tandem, the Securities and Exchange Commission should require U.S.-listed companies to adopt and implement Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) recommendations on climate-related financial reporting.", "Implementation of TCFD protocols has the potential to accelerate the wind down of fossil fuel-related investment, for example.", "- Decarbonize U.S. trade finance programs. To mobilize U.S. private climate project finance, a new administration should: 1) overhaul the Overseas Private Investment Corporation—transforming into the U.S. International Development Finance Corporation (USDFC) in October253—and Ex-Im Bank’s energy-related financing policies; and 2) turbocharge their financing resources and authorities.", "The administration should declare a blanket prohibition on U.S. financing for overseas fossil fuel projects, from mining to power generation.", "Operating with boosted resources and closing fossil fuel support, the USDFC and Ex-Im can then fully focus their energy agendas to support a clean energy mission and the U.N Sustainable Development Goals.", "- Decarbonize foreign trade finance programs. To complement its reform of U.S. public finance policy on fossil fuel financing and achieve a main objective under the global decarbonization initiative, the new administration should immediately press other Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD)-member governments to adopt the same policy.", "To achieve meaningful change on fossil fuel financing, the United States and others will have to press China, which is not subject to OECD guidelines, to adopt the same approach.", "- Make good on the U.S. commitment to the Green Climate Fund (GCF). President Trump’s failure to honor the $2 billion U.S. contribution to the GCF was a strike to the global effort to support developing countries and to international confidence in U.S. reliability on combating climate change.254 To repair the damage, a future administration should make whole the $2 billion pledge balance.", "Furthermore, the United States should join other donors, who are doubling their contributions to the GCF.", "For the United States, a $6 billion pledge over three years would fund 100 new projects and catalyze nearly $15 billion in cofinancing.", "The emissions reduction estimates presented in this report are not the product of comprehensive, integrated modeling, but are instead drawn from a variety of estimates published in other contexts.", "In general, CAP sought the most reliable and sector-specific published reports to furnish these estimates.", "To avoid double counting, this report quantifies the impact only of the six sector-specific benchmarks discussed above.", "Substantial additional emission reductions are possible if more ambitious benchmarks can be supported and from additional policies, as described below.", "Taken together, these additional

technology development and deployment scenarios could result in higher amounts of carbon sequestration.", "There is not currently a satisfactory level of modeling of specific emissions reductions pathways in the context of the new goal of 1.5 degrees Celsius set by the IPCC.", "The emissions reduction estimates presented in this paper are not the product of comprehensive modeling but are instead drawn from a variety of estimates published in other contexts.", "The emission estimates are tied to the sectoral benchmarks and not to the discrete, marginal effects of each policy.", "A description of this methodology can be found in the appendix.", "Modeling, research, and analysis of the cumulative impacts and disproportionate distribution of local pollution has also been inadequately funded to date and has not been incorporated well enough into greenhouse gas mitigation modeling.", "This deficiency unnecessarily adds to the challenge of incorporating environmental justice and equity into climate policy and hinders the effort to reduce pollution of all types in overburdened communities where pollution sources have historically been concentrated.", "CAP calls for additional modeling and scientific analysis to validate emission reduction pathways in the United States under a variety of technological, economic, and political conditions, including analysis of the geographic and racial distributional impacts and the effects on various forms of pollution, so that policymakers can understand with increased confidence which suite of emissions reduction policies will work together to best accomplish a 100 Percent Clean Future.", "To achieve the wide-ranging outcomes described above, a structural change within the White House will likely be necessary.", "The scope and urgency of the climate crisis, as well as the need to sustain a program of policy innovation for decades, will require a coordinated, holistic effort drawing on the expertise and resources of the entire federal government.", "Responsibilities for addressing the nation’s climate change challenge reach beyond the purview of the EPA, Department of Energy, Department of the Interior, and the USDA to include those government entities focused on the economy, public health, trade, national security, research, affordable housing, emergency response, finance, and intelligence.", "Effective and enduring solutions at the federal level will require sustained senior-level leadership, a unified vision, and constant coordination.", "To achieve such an outcome, the president should create a new White House component called the National Climate Council that is run by a director with the title of assistant to the president for climate policy.", "The council should be comprised of cabinet-level leadership and tasked with directing, coordinating, and delivering measurable climate outcomes across the federal government.", "This council is modeled on the National Security and National Economic Councils, which are supported by specialized staff.", "A new president will have no time to waste in setting the country on the path to achieving a 100 Percent Clean Future.", "Therefore, the first action of the National Climate Council should be to set the 100 percent clean target and appropriate benchmarks across the federal government against which progress will be measured.", "The new White House component will also need to work closely with the U.S. Congress to enact legislation, including to codify the 100 Percent Clean Future target, that will be needed to be successful in carrying out the policy recommendations listed throughout this report.", "As with any major social change, it takes individuals demanding action and doing their part to address the problem.", "The Green New Deal, the Sunrise Movement, and the Global Climate Strikes show that activists are energized and forcing leaders to step up to the challenge.", "Not everyone is ready to be an activist, but many people want to get involved and make choices that can be a powerful part of the solution.", "Whether choosing to purchase products with sustainable supply chains, investing in climate-conscious funds, making your home and appliances more energy efficient, buying an electric vehicle, or taking public transportation, lifestyle and consumption choices equip every American to become part of the climate solution today.", "With a smart phone in everyone’s pocket, a simple game application should be developed for teachers, parents, and pretty much anyone interested in tracking what they can do to protect the planet.", "Each consumer choice or individual action could give you points until you reach your own net-zero status.", "Unlike other recommendations in this

The aim of our cross-sectional study was to investigate the association between meal planning and diet quality, including adherence to nutritional guidelines and food variety, as well as weight status.", "Meal planning, i.e. planning ahead the foods that will be eaten for the next few days, was assessed in 40,554 participants of the web-based observational NutriNet-Santé study.", "Dietary measurements included intakes of energy, nutrients, food groups, and adherence to the French nutritional guidelines (mPNNS-GS) estimated through repeated 24-h dietary records.", "A food variety score was also calculated using Food Frequency Questionnaire. Weight and height were self-reported.", "Association between meal planning and dietary intakes were assessed using ANCOVAs, while associations with quartiles of mPNNS-GS scores, quartiles of food variety score and weight status categories (overweight, obesity) were evaluated using logistic regression models.", "A total of 57% of the participants declared to plan meals at least occasionally. Meal planners were more likely to have a higher mPNNS-GS (OR quartile 4 vs. 1 = 1.13, 95% CI: [1.07–1.20]), higher overall food variety (OR quartile 4 vs. 1 = 1.25, 95% CI: [1.18–1.32]).", "In women, meal planning was associated with lower odds of being overweight (OR = 0.92 [0.87–0.98]) and obese (OR = 0.79 [0.73–0.86]).", "In men, the association was significant for obesity only (OR = 0.81 [0.69–0.94]).", "Meal planning was associated with a healthier diet and less obesity. Although no causality can be inferred from the reported associations, these data suggest that meal planning could potentially be relevant for obesity prevention.", "In industrialized countries, eating habits and cooking practices have considerably changed. First, time devoted to cooking has decreased: in the United States, it has been reduced from 1:63 hour per day in 1965–1966 to 58 min in 2006–2007 [1].", "Additionally, the source of food consumed has changed: people consume less food prepared at home, whereas foods prepared away from home represent an increasing part of the diet", "In light of this observation, a number of studies have evaluated the potential impact of food prepared away from home on dietary quality, as well as weight status.", "These studies highlighted that the consumption of food prepared away from home is associated with a lower quality diet [5–8] and a higher body mass index [9–11], whereas benefits have been attributed to home-prepared food [2, 12–14].", "More frequent home food preparation has been associated with better adherence to dietary objectives [12], higher intakes of fruits, vegetables [13, 14], fiber, folate and vitamin A, while lower intakes of fat in young people [13].", "Therefore, home meal preparation has been increasingly promoted as a strategy for improving dietary quality and preventing obesity [12–15].", "In designing strategies to promote home cooking, it is important to understand the patterns and correlates of home meal practices.", "Many studies have investigated the reasons why people cook less. Time scarcity and cooking skills were identified as common barriers to prepare home meals [6, 11, 12, 16, 17].", "Previous research emphasized that individuals with lower cooking skills were more likely to consume away from home food such as ready meals or take-out meals from fast food or restaurants [11, 18].", "In response to these difficulties, a number of studies have evaluated the opportunity to improve cooking skills in order to promote healthy dietary patterns [19–21].", "To face time pressure, a series of qualitative studies highlighted that parents resort to food choice coping strategies, such as meal simplification, taking out, or meal planning [16, 17, 22–26] despite their potential impact on diet quality.", "Among these strategies, time management skills [27] and in particular meal planning [28, 29], which consists in deciding ahead the foods that will be eaten in the next few days, has been previously suggested as a solution to balance competing time demands and reduce barriers to healthy dietary practices.", "In the literature, very few studies have investigated meal planning practices and they often focused on adequate diet for diabetic subjects", "[30–32]. Studies performed on general populations showed that meal planning was positively associated with frequencies of home food preparation [29] and family meal [33], as well as the presence of fruits for dinner [34].", "To our knowledge, only one study in the literature has evaluated the potential link between meal planning and food consumption.", "It focused on fruit and vegetables specifically, and showed that planning meal ahead was associated with higher fruit and vegetable intakes [35].", "However, the latter presented weakness in the dietary intake assessment method since it consisted only of questions on the number of servings eaten per day.", "Additionally, meal planning was evaluated, among various practices, as a tool to maintain weight among successful weight losers [36, 37] but no data exists on the potential relationship with weight status in the general population.", "In the present study, we hypothesize that meal planning might encourage home meal preparation, and therefore have beneficial effects on dietary quality and consequently on weight status.", "Thus, we first described meal planning practices among a large sample of individuals. Then, we investigated the relationships between meal planning and diet quality, based on adherence to nutritional guidelines, energy, macronutrients and food group intakes, as well as food variety.", "Finally, we evaluated the association between meal planning and weight status.", "The NutriNet-Santé study (http://info.etude-nutrinet-sante.fr) is an ongoing web-based prospective observational cohort study launched in France in May 2009 with a scheduled follow-up of 10 years.", "It aims to investigate the relationship between nutrition and chronic disease risk, as well as the determinants of dietary behavior and nutritional status.", "The study was implemented in the French general population (internet-using adult volunteers, aged ≥18 years).", "The rationale, design and methodology of the study have been fully described elsewhere [38]. In brief, to be included into the study, participants have to complete a baseline set of self-administered web-based questionnaires assessing dietary intake, physical activity, anthropometric characteristics, lifestyle, socioeconomic conditions and health status.", "As part of the follow-up, participants are asked to complete the same set of questionnaires each year.", "Moreover, each month, participants are invited by e-mail to fill in optional questionnaires related to dietary intake, determinants of eating behaviors, nutritional and health status.", "This study is conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki, and all procedures were approved by the Institutional Review Board of the French Institute for Health and Medical Research (IRB Inserm n°0000388FWA00005831) and the Commission Nationale de l’Informatique et des Libertés (CNIL n°908450 and n°909216).", "All participants provided informed consent with an electronic signature. This study is registered in EudraCT (n°2013-000929-31).", "Meal planning practices were assessed via an optional questionnaire launched in the NutriNet-Santé cohort study in April 2014.", "First, grocery shopping and cooking practices were evaluated. In particular, participants were asked to indicate whether they were involved in grocery shopping (every day, several times a week, once a week, less than once a week) and cooking (every day twice a day, every day once a day, several times a week but not every day, once a week, less than once a week, never) in their household.", "Then, participants were asked the following question “Generally, when do you choose the foods you are going to eat for meal?”", "(just before meal, during the day, the day before, few days before, one week before, never). Participants responding “never” were exempted to complete the rest of the questionnaire.", "Participants were also asked whether having to think about what they have to cook is a constraint for them.", "The responses were rated on a 5-point Likert scale ranging from one (strongly disagree) to five (strongly agree).", "Participants were then asked whether they planned meals, even in an irregular manner (yes I do, yes I did but not anymore, no I never planned meals).", "The definition of “planning meals” given to the participants was “to plan ahead the foods that will be eaten for the next few days”.", "Participants who reported planning meal currently were considered as “meal planners” whereas others were categorized as “non-meal planners”.", "Finally, the questionnaire included questions about meal planning frequency (several times a week, once a week, once every two weeks, two to three times a month, not regularly), duration (a few days, one week, two weeks or more), period of the week (weekdays, weekend, weekdays and weekend) and sources of inspiration (personal recipe repertoire, Internet or apps, ingredients available during grocery shopping).", "At baseline and annually thereafter, participants in the NutriNet-Santé study are asked to provide socio-demographic data, including sex, age (18–30, 30–50, 50–65, >65 years), educational level (up to secondary, some college or university degree), monthly income (<1,200 €, 1,200–1,800 €, 1,800–2,700 € and >2,700 € per consumption unit), presence of children in the household (yes, no), history of dieting to lose weight during the past year (yes, no) and physical activity (low, moderate, high).", "Monthly household income is calculated per “consumption unit” (CU), where one CU is attributed for the first adult in the household, 0.5 CU for other persons aged 14 or older, and 0.3 CU for children under 14, following national statistics methodology and guidelines [39].", "Physical activity was assessed using a short form of the French version of the International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ).", "The weekly energy expenditure expressed in metabolic equivalent task minutes per week was estimated, and three scores of physical activity were constituted [i.e., low (<30 min/day), moderate (30–59 min/day), and high (≥60 min/day)]", "according to the French guidelines for physical activity [40].", "For the present study, we used the closest available data with respect to the assessment of meal planning practices.", "At inclusion and once a year thereafter, participants are invited to complete three non-consecutive 24-h dietary records, randomly assigned over a 2-week period (two weekdays and one weekend day).", "For the present analysis, we selected participants who completed at least three 24-h dietary records since their inclusion in the cohort study (i.e. completed between May 2009 and December 2014).", "Participants reported all foods and beverages consumed at each eating occasion. They estimated the amounts eaten using validated photographs of portion sizes [41], using household measures or by indicating the exact quantity (grams) or volume (milliliters).", "Daily mean food intakes were calculated, weighted for the type of day of the week. Energy, nutrient and food group intakes were estimated using the NutriNet-Santé composition table including more than 2000 foods [42].", "Dietary underreporting was identified on the basis of the method proposed by Black [43]. We hypothesize that meal planning encourages food preparation and therefore considered food groups that can be used in food preparation (e.g. eggs).", "In addition, we considered food groups that have nutritional interest (e.g. fruits). Thus, the following food groups were included in the study: fruits, vegetables, fish (including seafood and processed seafood), meat (including cooked ham, offal), eggs, milk, cheese, added fats (including oil, butter, margarine, vinaigrette), sugary products (e.g. cake, biscuits, sugars, honey, jam, chocolate) and starchy foods (including potato, legumes, pasta, rice, other cereals) with a specific focus on legumes and whole grain starchy foods (including whole grain pasta, rice, other cereals).", "Adherence to nutritional guidelines was assessed using the PNNS Guideline Score (PNNS-GS). The 15-point PNNS-GS is a validated a priori score reflecting the adherence to the official French nutritional guidelines which has been extensively described elsewhere [44].", "Details on computation of this score are in Additional file 1. Briefly, it includes 13 components: eight refer to food-serving recommendations (fruit and vegetables; starchy foods; whole grain products; dairy products; meat, eggs and fish; fish and seafood; vegetable fat; water vs. soda), four refer to moderation in consumption (added fat; salt; sweets; alcohol) and one component pertains to physical activity [44, 45].", "Points are deducted for overconsumption of salt (>12 g/day), added sugars (>17.5% of energy intake), or when energy intake exceeds the needed energy level by more than 5%.", "Each component cut-off was that of the threshold defined by the PNNS public health objectives when available [45] otherwise they were established according to the French Recommended Dietary Allowances [46].", "For the present analysis, we consider the mPNNS-GS, a modified version of the PNNS-GS, which takes into account only the dietary components, therefore excluding the physical activity component.", "Food variety has been defined as the number of different food items reported to be eaten over a given reference period [47].", "Considering that seasonality is likely to influence food variety and that a period of 10 to 15 days has been recommended to accurately assess food variety [48], the food variety was evaluated using a Food Frequency Questionnaire (FFQ).", "Sixteen months after baseline, participants were invited to complete a self-administrated 240-items FFQ to assess their usual dietary intake over the past year [49].", "Participants were asked to report their consumption frequency on the basis of how many times they ate the standard portion size proposed (typical household measurements such as spoon or standard unit such as a yogurt).", "The frequency of consumption referred to usual consumption over the past year on an increasing scale including yearly, monthly, weekly or daily units, as suitable, and participants were asked to provide only one answer.", "The food variety score corresponded to the number of FFQ items reported to be consumed at least once during the last year [47].", "The maximum score was therefore 240. Fruit and vegetable variety scores were also computed based on the number of different fruits and vegetables reported by the participants.", "Height and weight were assessed by using an anthropometric questionnaire, which was self-administered online, at baseline and each year thereafter [50, 51].", "For each participant, the closest available data to the meal planning questionnaire were used for the analysis.", "Data were not collected for pregnant women. BMI (in kg/m2) was calculated as the ratio of weight to squared height.", "Participants were classified as underweight or normal weight (BMI < 25), overweight (25 ≤ BMI < 30) and obesity (BMI ≥ 30) according to WHO references values [52].", "The analysis focused on participants who had completed the meal planning questionnaire, had declared being involved in meal preparation in their household, and who had completed at least three 24-h dietary records since they were included in the study, as well as the FFQ.", "Chi-square tests and Student’s t tests were used to compare characteristics of included vs. excluded participants, as well as meal planners vs. non-meal planners.", "Meal planners’ practices were also described. Continuous variables are presented as means ± SDs and categorical variables as percentages.", "ANCOVAs were performed to investigate the relationship between meal planning and energy, macronutrients and food groups.", "However, for some particular food groups which did not exhibit normal distribution (i.e. eggs, milk, legumes, and whole grain starchy foods), mainly due to a high proportion of non-consumers, a binary variable (consumer/non-consumer) was created and a logistic regression analysis was performed.", "Logistic regression models were also used to assess the associations between meal planning and quartiles of mPNNS-GS, as well as quartiles of food variety scores (overall, fruit and vegetable) and BMI categories.", "Due to significant interactions and differences on the associations with meal planning, analyses on BMI were performed separately by sex.", "Meal planning has been described as a cooking skill [53]. Thus, characteristics that have been shown to influence cooking practices, dietary intakes or weight status were considered as confounders in the present analyses.", "Models were therefore all adjusted for sex [1, 54, 55], age [56], educational level, monthly income [6], presence of children in the household [6], history of dieting to lose weight during the past year [57], physical activity [58], and cooking frequency.", "Models evaluating the associations with mPNNS-GS, macronutrient and food groups intakes were further adjusted for daily energy intake and number of 24-h dietary records completed by participants.", "The energy model was only adjusted on the number of 24-h records while the food variety models were adjusted on daily energy intake.", "Missing covariate data were imputed using multiple imputation method.", "Sensitivity analyses were conducted on a subsample of individuals having responded to at least one of the dietary assessments (i.e. FFQ, dietary records).", "In addition, analyses were conducted using another definition of food variety score (number of FFQ items reported to be consumed more than once a week)", "All tests of statistical significance were two-sided and the type I error was set at 5%.

The majority of non-meal planners decided what food to prepare during the day or just before meal whereas meal planners reported to decide during the day, the day before or few days before.", "Finally, thinking about what food to prepare was less of a constraint for meal planners than for non-meal planners (all P < 0.0001).", "Results among meal planners more specifically showed that the majority of participants planned their meals at least once a week.", "A non-negligible part (14.8%) also reported to plan meals not regularly. Three-quarters of participants planned meals for a few days, but less than a week.", "Meals were mostly planned for both weekdays and weekend.

Generally, individuals planned their meals several times a week, for a few days period including weekdays and weekend, and get inspiration mostly from their personal recipe repertoire or ingredients available during grocery shopping.", "A previous survey evaluating Canadians’ attitudes and habits with regard to home food preparation highlighted that about 40% of the participants decide what they will prepare for dinner during the day, 27% the day before and 33% at least two days before [29].", "However, the latter did not explore the modalities of meal planning.", "Based on a large sample of general population, our data support the notion that planning meal is indeed associated with a better adherence to nutritional guidelines and an increased food variety (overall, fruits and vegetables).", "However, it should be noted that only small differences were observed with energy, macronutrient and food group intakes specifically.", "Although meal planning has been previously suggested as a potential tool to improve dietary quality [28, 29], to our knowledge, no study in the literature has investigated this related association.", "Previous authors highlighted that individuals deciding in advance what to prepare for dinner were more likely to cook homemade dishes [29].", "Since more frequent food preparation has been linked with a better diet quality [12–14], this could potentially explain the healthier diet observed in meal planners.", "A few hypotheses can be made on how meal planning could encourage home food preparation. First, meal planning might address the issue of not knowing what to prepare for dinner, that has been previously described as a barrier for home meal preparation [29].", "Second, by planning meals individuals may think about recipes that can be prepared in a limited period of time and, therefore reduce the feeling of time scarcity, that may limit home meal preparation", "[6, 12, 16] and increase the recourse to food choice coping strategies such as eating out, delivery meals or ready prepared food", "[17, 23–25]. In addition, planning meals may reduce the risk of missing ingredients for home meal preparation which could also lead to the consumption of food prepared away from home.", "Finally, deciding what foods will be eaten in the next few days could also enable individuals to cook more diversified recipes and to anticipate grocery shopping for the specific ingredients needed, thus potentially explaining the increased food variety observed in meal planners.", "However, reverse causality cannot be excluded since individuals interested in having a healthy diet might be more likely to plan their meals.", "In line with this idea, meal-planners in our sample were more likely to have higher educational level, to have higher income, to be physically active and to have a lower BMI, characteristics that have been related with a better attitude towards healthy eating [61].", "Our results showed that women who planned meals were less likely to be overweight or obese, while in men, there was an association with obesity only.", "Since meal planners have a diet of higher quality, it potentially prevents overweight in these individuals [52].", "However, we cannot exclude reverse causality. People attaching more importance to food and weight management might be more likely to plan their meals.", "In line with this hypothesis, two studies in the literature highlighted that meal planning is more frequently used by successful weight loss maintainers compared to those who did not maintain weight losses [36, 37].", "In terms of public health, our results bring supportive insights that promoting meal planning might encourage the preparation of healthier and more varied home meals.", "Previous studies showed that parents would be interested in learning how to plan meals [28, 60], however, other findings suggested that meal planning is also perceived as complex and time consuming [62].", "Specific tools might assist people in managing meal planning but to be adopted and sustainable over time, it is important to identify consumers’ needs.", "The present data highlighted that there are various ways of planning meals. As an example, we observed that the ingredients available during grocery shopping are likely to influence meal planning while existing tools rather propose menus to plan grocery shopping.", "A major strength of this study was its large sample size allowing an evaluation of meal planning practices at a population level.", "The wide range of socio-economic and lifestyle variables collected through the web-based platform enables the control of potential effects of confounding factors.", "In addition, the web-based tool used to assess 24-h dietary records has shown a good validity in prior studies [63, 64].", "However, because of the influence of seasonality on food variety, the FFQ was used to evaluate dietary variety since it allows usual intake estimates over a relatively long period of time [65].", "This study was also subject to several limitations. First, the cross-sectional design of this study prevented any inference of causality.", "Moreover, since participants were volunteers in a nutrition focused cohort, they may have higher health consciousness and interest in nutritional issues.", "The fact that we selected only participants who completed both dietary assessment tools might have exacerbated this characteristic in our sample.", "Therefore, caution is needed when generalizing our results. However, sensitivity analyses including individuals with at least one of the dietary assessments (24-h dietary records or FFQ) revealed similar trends.", "Besides, the fact that participants had relatively high knowledge in nutrition could potentially account for the few differences observed in energy and food group intakes, since they may be able to cook healthful meals without planning meals.", "It is also important to consider that food variety score was based on FFQ data, which has been recorded at different time frames (16 months after the inclusion in the cohort).", "Thus, for participants included since a long time in the cohort study, the estimation may not represent their current dietary repertoire.", "In addition, data were self-reported, thus potentially leading to misreporting due, for example, to desirability bias.", "Nonetheless, previous validation studies performed on a subsample of the NutriNet-Santé study have supported the good validity of self-reported anthropometric and dietary data [63, 64, 66].", "Finally, given that meal planning may be influenced by numerous parameters such as cooking practices and food availability in the surrounding, it is possible that some factors mediating the associations observed in the present paper were not taken into account in the analyses.", "The potential impact of cooking practices was however considered by adding cooking frequency as a confounder.", "Future research should be conducted to address the issue of how food availability could potentially influence the relationship observed between meal planning and diet quality.", "Our results highlighted that individuals planning their meals were more likely to have a better dietary quality, including a higher adherence with nutritional guidelines as well as an increased food variety.", "Additionally, meal planning was associated with lower odds of being obese in men and women and overweight in women only.", "Although interventional or prospective research should be conducted in order to infer causality, these data suggest the potential interest of promoting meal planning to improve dietary quality and prevent overweight.", "Such a tool could partly address the issue of time scarcity reported by consumers for meal preparation and, might therefore encourage home cooking.", "Given the potential benefits of meal planning identified in this study, it would be interesting that future research evaluate the appropriation and the impact of applications designed to help individuals planning their meals.", "Modified Programme National Nutrition Santé-Guideline Score", "Smith LP, Ng SW, Popkin BM.

The wounded men were taken", "to the Marine Hospital, in Norfolk, where one of them died. Intense", "indignation prevailed in the city. It was believed that the outrage", "was deliberately designed, and the cry for vengeance burst from the", "whole people. In full assembly, with the venerable General Matthews", "presiding, they appointed, as in the days of '76, a Committee of Safety.", "A preamble, duly setting forth the outrage on the \"Chesapeake,\" was", "adopted, and it was resolved that there should be no intercourse with", "the British frigates in the Norfolk waters, or with their agents, until", "the decision of the United States Government was known, under the", "penalty of being deemed infamous; and the Committee of Safety—", "Thomas Matthews, Thomas Newton, Jr., Luke Wheeler, Theodric", "Armistead, Richard E. Lee, Moses Myers, William Pennock, William", "Newsum, Thomas Blanchard, Daniel Bedinger, Seth Foster, J. W.", "Murdaugh, Richard Blow, and Francis S. Taylor—were authorized to", "take such measures as the emergency demanded. As soon as the British", "commander—Commodore Douglas—read the resolves, he addressed,", "on the 3d of July, an insolent letter to the Mayor of the Borough, in", "which he declared if the resolutions were not instantly annulled, he would", "prohibit every vessel bound in or out of Norfolk from proceeding to", "her place of destination. He closed his communication by saying that", "he had proceeded with his squadron of four fifty-gun frigates to Hampton", "Roads to await the answer of the Mayor, which he hoped would be", "forwarded without delay. It is thought that Mr. Tazewell had regulated", "the popular proceedings from their initiation. In the delicate dilemma,", "which was ominous of vengeful deeds and of so much menace to the", "commercial interests of Norfolk, he came to the assistance of the Mayor", "and dictated a reply to the audacious Briton which elicited the admiration", "of the whole American Nation. The letter, written on the 4th of", "The day on which this answer is written ought of itself to prove to", "the subjects of your sovereign that the American people are not to be", "imtimidated by menace; or induced to adopt any measures except by", "a sense of their perfect propriety.

It had a due effect.", "The threats were all recanted, and a letter of the 5th of July breathed", "nothing but amity and peace—an amusing somersault, like unto which is", "scarcely to be recalled in the annals of diplomacy.", "In 1816, during an absence from home, and without his knowledge,", "Mr. Tazewell was elected by the people of Norfolk to the House of Delegates.", "His speech in that body against the Convention bill, and in", "reply to General Alexander Smyth, is memorable for its ability and eloquence.", "The bill passed in the House but was lost in the Senate. In", "1820 Mr. Tazewell was one of the Commissioners under the Florida", "treaty. In 1824 he was elected to the United States Senate. He was", "elected to fill a vacancy caused by the resignation of John Taylor of", "Caroline. It is a coincidence that his father, thirty years before, was", "chosen to fill the vacancy in the Senate caused by the resignation of the", "same individual. L. W.

At his deposition, Brehmer testified that Cody, who was eleven at the time, suffered from Tourette Syndrome, Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder, and was \"an alcohol baby with some brain damage.\"", "According to Brehmer, he needed to accompany Dixon to Texas because Cody easily became upset, stressed and agitated, and Dixon would need assistance.", "There is no dispute that in response to Brehmer's request, Xcel, Brehmer, and the Union entered into a written agreement that permitted Brehmer to take the requested personal days provided Brehmer did not request any additional personal days in 2004.", "Brehmer does not dispute that on November 5, 2004, he told his foreman that he had forgotten his cell phone at home and the two stopped at Brehmer's house on the way to another job site so he could retrieve it.", "Brehmer's deposition testimony indicated that while he was inside the house, he learned that Cody was having problems at school that required his attention and that he told the foreman he (Brehmer) was sick and did not accompany the foreman to the next job.", "Brehmer admitted that he then called Xcel and reported that he was sick and did not return to work that day.", "Although Brehmer disputes Xcel's characterization of his violations of company safety policies, he does not deny that certain violations occurred.", "For example, Brehmer does not dispute that he received an oral reminder in May 2001 after he damaged an automobile while driving an Xcel boom truck at a job site.", "He testified that he should have been wearing rubber gloves while quickly stripping rubber hosing off of energized lines at the conclusion of a job in May 2004, although he stated that it was common practice for linemen not to do so.", "It is undisputed that on October 25, 2004, Brehmer was assigned the task of watching an apprentice lineman perform work in a bucket up in the air.", "Brehmer denies that the apprentice was working on energized lines and denies that he left the apprentice unsupervised, as Xcel alleges.", "Brehmer does not, however, dispute that he left the job site for lunch while the apprentice was still up in the air working or that a foreman later reported Brehmer's conduct to a supervisor.", "According to the deposition testimony of Brehmer's former supervisor, Jeff Custer, Brehmer failed to follow company policy regarding the reporting of traffic violations in 2004.", "Brehmer testified in his deposition that he forgot to report a traffic violation he received in May 2004 until December 1, 2004, despite his knowledge that, as a holder of a commercial driver's license, he was required to report the violation within thirty days.", "Custer further testified that on several occasions, Brehmer took personal phone calls during department meetings.", "According to Brehmer's deposition testimony, his cellular phone would sometimes ring during company safety meetings and he would either turn his cell phone off when it rang or step out of the meeting to answer the call.", "Sometime in early December 2004, Brehmer asked Custer if he could have December 15 off from work because Dixon was scheduled to have surgery.", "There is a dispute between the parties regarding the exact date Brehmer told Custer that he needed the day off.", "Brehmer claims he first told Custer about the surgery several weeks before December 15, and he asserts that he told Custer about it on numerous other occasions before a final conversation on December 14.", "Custer testified in his deposition that Brehmer first told him he needed the day off for Dixon's surgery on December 13, and that he denied Brehmer's request and reminded him of his prior agreement to refrain from taking additional personal time off during 2004.", "There is no dispute that, at the end of his shift on December 14, Brehmer informed Custer he would not report for work the next day and that he would not call in to report his absence because Dixon's surgery was scheduled for very early in the morning.", "There is also a dispute over whether Brehmer told Custer he needed December 15 off because he needed to care for Cody during Dixon's surgery.", "According to Custer's deposition testimony, Brehmer requested the day off because his girlfriend was having surgery and did not say anything about caring for Cody when he made the request.", "Brehmer provides conflicting testimony. At his deposition, he testified that he did not know for sure, that he could not recall, and then \"Yeah, I suppose,", "yeah I could have\" when asked whether he mentioned Cody when he asked to have December 15 off. In a later affidavit, discussed more fully below, Brehmer stated that he told Custer about his need to care for Cody several weeks before Dixon's surgery and then again on two more occasions a week and a half before Dixon's surgery, once at a job site near Highway 62 and once in Custer's office.", "It is undisputed that, on the morning on December 15, Brehmer took Dixon to the hospital for her surgery and that he did not call Xcel to report his absence.", "Brehmer testified that he stayed at the hospital until Dixon was in surgery, and then he went to check on Cody, who had stayed home from school and was at Dixon's home under the care of Dixon's sister and an unidentified male tenant who rented the basement of Dixon's home.", "Brehmer testified that he traveled back and forth between the hospital and Dixon's home several times that day to check on Cody.", "Brehmer returned to work at Xcel the following day. Dixon remained in the hospital for several weeks.", "Upon his return to work, Xcel sent Brehmer home on \"crisis suspension,\" a paid day of leave, to allow Xcel to consider possible misconduct by Brehmer and to decide whether to discipline or terminate him.", "Custer drafted a memo to Larry Crosby, Xcel's Director of Metro West Operations at the time, describing incidents of Brehmer's absenteeism, safety violations, and failure to follow the direction of his supervisors.", "Custer recommended that Xcel immediately terminate Brehmer. Xcel then terminated Brehmer citing \"his defiant refusal to follow a direct order of his manager\" and \"a pattern of behavior showing blatant disregard for authority\" as the reasons.", "After his termination, Brehmer contacted the Union and sought to file a grievance for wrongful termination.", "In January 2006, the Union assigned Brehmer to work as a lineman for Donovan Construction (Donovan). Donovan is a power line contractor for Xcel.", "Crosby testified that it is Xcel's practice to deny terminated employees access to Xcel facilities and property, and that consistent with this practice, Xcel's contractor agreement with Donovan provides Xcel with the right to request the removal of Donovan employees from Xcel's property.", "According to Crosby's deposition testimony, when Xcel learned that Brehmer was performing work for Donovan on Xcel's lines, Xcel informed Donovan that Brehmer could not work on Xcel property.", "There is no dispute that following this request, Donovan terminated Brehmer's employment.", "Brehmer subsequently sought work through the Union. He testified that during the year or so after his termination from Donovan, he worked for (1) a company in Richfield, Minnesota, where he changed street lights, (2) a construction company in Ladysmith, Wisconsin, where he performed transmission line work, (3) a power company in Duluth, Minnesota, where he rebuilt power lines, and (4) a power company in Superior, Wisconsin, where he performed transmission line work.", "Brehmer left his job in Superior, Wisconsin, after a foot injury made it too painful for him to continue working.", "According to Brehmer's deposition testimony, in March 2007, after he had recovered from his foot pain, the Union sent him to work for a company in Blaine, Minnesota, where he installed wireless internet transmitters in Minneapolis.", "After he was laid off, the Union sent Bremer to another Minneapolis company where he performed the same work.", "In July 2006, Brehmer brought this action against Xcel alleging violations of the FMLA, intentional interference with his contract with Donovan, and intentional interference with future contracts and prospective business relations.", "Xcel seeks summary judgment on all of Brehmer's claims.", "Summary judgment is proper \"if the pleadings, the discovery and disclosure materials on file, and any affidavits show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\"", "Fed.

Seems this settlement conference is just the place for raising a stink about the PJM cost apportionment scheme, to raise issues of “benefits” and “cause cost, pay” arguments.", "As if they don’t exist? Yes, and that’s because they don’t. That’s because they’re transmission projects in their own minds, and not in reality.", "What? SPP, the Southwest Power Pool, dissing Clean Line? See for yourself! It’s as simple as doing a simple search of the SPP planning reports.", "We know, Clean Line is all about Clean Line, but there’s a significant disconnect between what Clean Line is saying about SPP, claiming “approval” of its projects and incorporation of those projects into SPP’s plans, and the reality of what shows up in those plans.", "Or more correctly, what DOESN’T show up in those plans:", "Whadda ya mean?

As one who spends an inordinate amount of time outside the doorway of nearly every utility infrastructure meeting, open house, and hearing, handing out flyers and greeting everyone as the come in (just attended this last round of GNTL, printer not working so no flyers to be handed out!), this killing by RCMP is most disturbing.", "When stationed outside meetings, I’ve been told to leave, to stop handing out flyers (pretty revolutionary flyers, too, telling people how to file comments on the records, urging them to show up at hearings), and I’ve been told to get off private property, that’s happened a few times over the years.", "And each time I’ve objected, “resisted” following their directions, standing my ground. I’ve also objected to police presence at these meetings — sometimes they’re called to keep an eye on things (??", "exactly what and why??), and admittedly certain people, and I tell the organizers and the officers that I object, and stress that it has a chilling effect on participation.", "Now?

RCMP arrived on high alert, found a man at the entrance wearing a mask, according to statements, officers presumed it was same one disrupting the open house, they had an agitated back and forth with the man near the door, it’s reported he had a knife, in hand or in case on belt.", "RCMP shoots and kills him.

His father, physician Stephen Arnold Douglass, died when the baby was only two months old.", "His mother, Sarah Fiske Douglass, remarried to Gehazi Granger. In 1830, the Granger family moved from Vermont to upstate New York, where after a brief period at an academy Stephen Douglass began to read law under a locally prominent Democratic attorney.", "In 1833, Stephen made his way west to seek his career and fortune. After arriving in Quincy, Illinois, and operating a private school for a time, he secured a law license and set up practice in Jacksonville, Illinois.", "As he established the basis for a professional career, Stephen also changed the spelling of his last name from Douglass to Douglas.", "Stephen A. Douglas first became politically known in Illinois as a staunch Democratic proponent of President Andrew Jackson.", "Between 1835 and 1840, Douglas held a succession of Illinois state offices, some of them concurrently, including state’s attorney, state legislator, register of the Springfield land office, and secretary of state.", "In 1841, at the age of twenty-seven, he was elected to a seat on the Illinois Supreme Court. In 1836, he lost a disputed race for the U.S. House of Representatives by thirty-six popular votes.", "Four years later he lost a campaign for a U.S. Senate seat by five legislative votes. Only in 1843, running in a newly created congressional district, was Douglas able to win a seat in the House.", "As a member of the House of Representatives, Douglas was among those urging an extension of United States territory from the Atlantic to the Pacific.", "He called for the annexation of Texas, the establishment of military posts along the Western emigrant trails, and organization of a Nebraska territorial government.", "By 1845, these and other strong expansionist positions had won Douglas the chairmanship of the House Committee on Territories.", "Through a congressional colleague, Douglas met Martha Denny Martin (1825-1853), the daughter of a wealthy North Carolina planter and a member of a family long prominent in North Carolina political affairs.", "When Stephen and Martha were married in 1847, Robert Martin offered his new son-in-law his 2,500-acre plantation on the Pearl River in Lawrence County, Mississippi.", "Douglas declined the gift, but after Martin died a year later, the Pearl River plantation was bequeathed to Martha and any children she might have.", "Douglas was designated as the property manager and was allocated 20 per cent of the plantation’s annual income for his services.", "Two children born to their marriage survived into adulthood, Robert Martin Douglas (1849-1917) and Stephen Arnold Douglas, Jr. (1850-1908).", "In 1847, after only three years in the House of Representatives, Douglas was elected by the Illinois state legislature to a seat in the U.S. Senate, where he was made chairman of the Senate Committee on Territories.", "His position gave him an influential role in shaping all aspects of national policy affecting western lands, from the courts and post office to military posts and legislative powers.", "He also became quickly immersed in growing sectional disputes over the future of slavery. As a Senator from a state with a mix of strong anti-slavery and pro-slavery sentiment, and as the manager of a Mississippi plantation with more than 100 slaves, Douglas attempted to craft a political position that would avoid favoring either the North or South.", "The first significant test of this policy, the Compromise of 1850, is usually credited to Henry Clay, but it owed a great deal to Douglas' political skills.", "To satisfy the North, California was admitted as a free state, and the slave trade was abolished in the District of Columbia; to reassure the South, the territories of New Mexico and Utah were organized without a prohibition of slavery, and a rigid fugitive slave law was enacted.", "Despite this careful attempt to placate both sides in the slavery controversy, the reaction to the Compromise in the North was immediate and hostile.", "Douglas came under fierce attack in his home state and was able to calm his supporters only by rushing back to Illinois to defend himself before the Chicago city council and the state legislature.", "In 1853, Douglas sustained a grave personal loss when his wife Martha died following complications from the birth of a daughter.", "After their infant girl also died a few weeks later, a grieving Douglas decided to leave the country for an extended tour of Europe.", "His travels took him to London, Constantinople, Moscow, St. Petersburg, and Paris, in the course of which he secured a number of diplomatic audiences and met Czar Nicholas I and Emperor Napoleon III.", "Douglas' personal life did not recover its equilibrium until 1856, when he married twenty-one-year-old Rose Adele Cutts (1835-1899), known as Adele, whose father, James Madison Cutts, was a nephew of President James Madison and Dolley Madison.", "The new Mrs. Douglas accepted Douglas' two sons as her own and raised them with his approval in her own Catholic faith.", "Their infant daughter Ellen died shortly after birth in 1859. The Douglases built an imposing townhouse in Washington just north of Capitol Hill, and it soon became renowned for lavish parties and receptions.", "Douglas' personal affairs also changed in other respects. In 1857, Douglas sold the family plantation on the Pearl River, which had been affected by flooding and poor crops, and in partnership with James A. McHatton of Baton Rouge, moved the agricultural operation to a 2,000-acre property south of Greenville, Mississippi.", "Throughout his career, Douglas maintained a strong interest in science, education, and technological improvements.", "In 1850, Douglas secured the passage of federal legislation supporting the Illinois Central Railroad route from Chicago down the Mississippi Valley to New Orleans, thus helping to make Chicago and Illinois a national center for industry and commerce.", "Douglas was an enthusiastic supporter of the Smithsonian Institution from the time of its founding and in 1854 was appointed a regent of the Smithsonian.", "In 1858 Douglas gave ten acres on the south side of Chicago to serve as the site of the newly organized University of Chicago; the land was part of his Oakenwald estate, where Douglas planned to develop an exclusive suburban neighborhood and erect his own residence.", "Douglas' rising prominence in national affairs reached a crest in January 1854, when he introduced the Kansas-Nebraska bill to organize governments in the Kansas and Nebraska territories.", "In each territory, the question of slavery would be reserved until it entered the Union as a new state; at that time, the voting citizens would draw up a constitution and determine whether or not their state would permit slavery.", "The Kansas-Nebraska bill embodied Douglas' doctrine of popular sovereignty, according to which the voters in newly admitted states, not the federal government, would determine the future of slavery by exercising their democratic rights to self-government.", "Douglas also hoped that popular sovereignty would remove slavery from congressional debate and insulate the federal government from further sectional conflict.", "The Kansas-Nebraska Act, however, unleashed a new torrent of angry protest by Northern anti-slavery forces, who felt it opened the door to an expansion of slavery across the West.", "Douglas returned to Illinois to defend his position, touring the state for two months and twice trading opposing speeches with Abraham Lincoln, a former Whig legislator and congressman who reemerged on the political stage and became a spokesman for the new Republican Party.", "In the wake of the Kansas-Nebraska Act, Douglas also found himself at odds with important elements of the national Democratic party.", "He had first attempted to gain the Democratic nomination for president in 1852. In 1856, he tried once again for the presidential nomination, but withdrew his name in favor of James Buchanan, who went on to win the election.", "The brief alliance between Buchanan and Douglas ended within a year, however, when a pro-slavery convention meeting in Lecompton, Kansas, drew up a constitution proposing statehood and protecting property in slavery.", "Buchanan supported the Lecompton constitution, but Douglas was determined to block it, arguing that its passage was fraudulent and did not express the will of the people in accordance with popular sovereignty.", "Although Douglas could not prevent congressional approval of the constitution, it was later rejected by the voters of Kansas.", "The struggle over Kansas and the spread of slavery became the dominant theme in the Senate election campaign of 1858 in Illinois.", "Douglas was renominated by the Democrats, while Abraham Lincoln was selected as the Republican candidate.", "The campaign between Douglas and Lincoln gained unexpected attention when Lincoln pressed Douglas to agree to join in a series of debates.", "Staged in seven Illinois towns from August to October of 1858, the campaign debates between Douglas and Lincoln drew large crowds and generated detailed press coverage.", "Lincoln charged that Douglas was part of a slavery \"dynasty\" seeking to promote the spread of slavery over the entire nation.", "Douglas argued that Lincoln’s \"House Divided\" speech had pushed the country to the brink of division and that popular sovereignty would resolve the slavery issue.", "On election day, the Republicans won a majority of the popular vote across the state; the Illinois legislature, however, remained in the hands of the Democrats, and Douglas was returned to Washington for another Senate term.", "Douglas and Lincoln were to meet again in the tumultuous presidential election of 1860. Divisions within the Democratic Party had become so deep that when Democrats met first in Charleston and later in Baltimore for their nominating convention, the southern delegates walked out.", "Douglas was able to win the presidential nomination from the remaining northern delegates, but the breakaway Democrats turned to John C. Breckinridge of Kentucky as their candidate.", "The Constitutional Union party nominated John Bell of Tennessee, and the Republicans chose Abraham Lincoln to carry their banner, making the 1860 presidential election a four-way race.", "Douglas was so concerned about the sectional division in the Democratic party and the potential rupture of the federal Union that he decided to break with precedent and campaign on his own behalf, the first presidential candidate in American history to do so.", "Frequently accompanied by Adele, Douglas campaigned through all parts of the country, from New England, New York, and Pennsylvania to Virginia, Tennessee, Alabama, and Georgia.", "His desperate efforts to reunite the Democratic party, however, could not overcome the rapidly disintegrating political situation.", "In November 1860, none of the four presidential candidates secured a majority of the popular vote, but Abraham Lincoln carried the electoral college and won the White House.", "In the months following the presidential election, Douglas returned to Washington to join the efforts to prevent the secession of the southern states, engaging in a series of private meetings with Lincoln to map strategy.", "When the Illinois state legislature went into special session, Douglas traveled to Springfield to make an impassioned speech rallying citizens to a defense of the Union.", "Several weeks later, while staying the Tremont House hotel in Chicago, Douglas fell ill, and his condition soon began to deteriorate.", "On June 3, 1861, with his wife, Adele, at his side, he died.", "The funeral of Stephen A. Douglas was attended by more than 5,000 mourners. His body was laid to rest in a temporary tomb overlooking Lake Michigan, on the Oakenwald property that he had selected for his Chicago residence.", "In 1881, a permanent monument was erected on the site; its designer was Leonard W. Volk, whose wife was a cousin of Douglas and whose education as an artist had been sponsored by Douglas.", "The Civil War had immediate and devastating effects on Douglas family estate. In 1862, Camp Douglas, a Union military prison, was established at the northern end of the Oakenwald property; it housed more than 26,000 captured Confederate soldiers, of which 6,000 died.", "The Douglas mansion in Washington was turned over to the Federal government, and it was converted into a military hospital for the duration of the conflict.", "In Mississippi, the Greenville plantation was raided by Union troops, and the entire cotton crop was lost.", "Douglas' two sons later attempted to recover compensation from the federal government, but without success.", "After the war, Robert Martin Douglas graduated from Georgetown College, served as private secretary to President Ulysses S. Grant, and became a justice of the North Carolina Supreme Court.", "Stephen A. Douglas, Jr., who also studied at Georgetown, moved from North Carolina to Chicago and became an attorney.", "Adele Cutts Douglas remarried in 1866 to Brevet Brigadier General Robert Williams, who later became Adjutant General of the U.S. Army; they had six children.", "The Stephen A. Douglas collection is organized into seven series: Series I: Senate and Constituent Correspondence; Series II: Political; Series III: Personal; Series IV: Financial and Legal; Series V: Artifacts and Ephemera; Series VI: Oversized; and Series VII: Books.", "The largest portion of the collection is housed in Series I. This series contains the incoming correspondence of senators and constituents contemporary to Stephen A. Douglas, arranged chronologically from 1800 to 1867.", "Correspondence with unknown dates has been arranged alphabetically by the name signed and is located at the end of this series.", "Douglas' name has been abbreviated as SAD within Series I.", "Series II consists of materials pertaining to Douglas' political career.
