Most of these companies are essentially government-sanctioned monopolies with locked in customer bases, exclusive rights within their service areas, and guaranteed returns on capital set by regulators to incentivize continued investment into their asset base.", "The most important driver of utility earnings is growth of the rate base. Rate base is the assets on which a company earns its allowed return on equity.", "American Electric has been growing its rate base at a relatively fast pace thanks to large amounts of investments into maintaining, upgrading, and expanding its infrastructure network.", "American Electric has been growing its rate base at a relatively fast pace thanks to large amounts of investments into maintaining, upgrading, and expanding its infrastructure network.", "Management expects to invest $17.7 billion, or $5.9 billion per year, into approved growth projects between 2018 and 2020.", "Importantly, the vast majority of this spending is going into regulated investments and wires, which are lower-risk projects that will provide greater reliability for AEP's customers.", "In recent years, AEP has struggled in its large Ohio segment, thanks in part due to that state's decision to deregulate its electric industry in 2001.", "This move helped save electric customers an estimated $3 billion a year, by pitting regulated utilities like AEP and Duke Energy (DUK) against numerous smaller merchant power producers.", "These producers enjoyed several competitive advantages including newer, more efficient gas fired plants, which require less maintenance and had much lower fuel costs.", "Both utilities have lobbied, unsuccessfully, to re-regulate the state's power industry. With little prospect for success, the company decided to sell off four legacy coal plants in 2017 and instead focus on two major growth areas.", "The biggest of these is electrical distribution, which has the most favorable regulatory environment in the industry.", "That's because America's large and aging electric grid is in major need of upgrades and maintenance. For example, the useful life expectancy of electric transformers and transmission lines is about 60 and 70 years, respectively.", "AEP's average transformer and transmission line is now 41 and 52 years old, respectively.", "The major need to maintain, enlarge, and improve this network means that regulators are willing to approve projects and grant them attractive returns on equity between 9.6% and 12.8%.", "This is why AEP has moved all of its transmission and distribution related assets into a separate holding company and plans to spend 72% of its capex budget ($4.25 billion per year) on high profitability transmission projects.", "That in turn is expected to drive 29% earnings growth from this business, whose share of the company's overall earnings is expected to rise from 17% in 2017 to 22% in 2020.", "The other major reason that American Electric likes the transmission and distribution business is because it ties into another growth catalyst, renewable energy.", "American Electric currently has 4.3 gigawatts of renewable power capacity, but the company has enormous plans to grow this in the coming years.", "For example, AEP is planning on spending $1.8 billion on solar and wind projects over the next three years, not including America's largest clean energy project, the $4.5 billion 2 gigawatt Wind Catcher wind farm in Oklahoma.", "This project will single-handedly make Oklahoma the country's second biggest wind power producer behind Texas and is expected to be completed in the mid-2020s, assuming it gains regulatory approval.", "By 2025 the company expects to add 5.6 gigawatts of renewable capacity, which represents 130% growth in solar and wind power generating assets.", "And by 2030, American Electric plans to have boosted its renewable capacity by a total of 8.3 gigawatts, or nearly 200%.", "Solar and wind are expected to represent about 33% of the company's total generating capacity at that point.", "And since solar and wind projects are usually located far from urban areas, where its customers are, these projects will require immense investments transmission and distribution systems as well.", "Of course, a large backlog of capex projects and a long potential growth runway is meaningless if a company doesn't have the financial resources to fund it, while still paying a generous and growing dividend.", "Fortunately, American Electric has a solid track record of balancing its growth without taking on excessive and dangerous amounts of debt.", "For example, the utilities debt/capitalization ratio has been highly stable over time, and its pension plan is fully funded.", "For example, the utilities debt/capitalization ratio has been highly stable over time, and its pension plan is fully funded.", "Importantly, AEP also enjoys low borrowing costs thanks to the utility's strong and stable investment grade credit ratings.", "By using long-term fixed rate debt, the company can lock in its profitability and reduce its earnings sensitivity to rising interest rates, too.", "Going forward, management has a plan to reduce AEP's leverage ratio to about 3.1 to 3.4, slightly below the industry average.", "That should help ensure its credit ratings remain stable.", "All told, management believes that the company's current growth plan will increase its rate base by about 8% annually through 2020, driving 5% to 7% earnings per share growth during that time.", "That should allow the utility to continues increasing its dividend at a pace of about 5% to 6% annually, making it a potentially attractive choice for conservative income investors.", "Regulated utilities are inherently low-risk businesses, but no company is risk free. In the case of regulated utilities like AEP, the biggest risk is the company's ongoing relationships with its regulators.", "For example, in 2018 the company will receive rate/investment decisions in numerous important markets including:", "The most concerning of these are the decisions in Kentucky, Oklahoma, and the company's SWEPCO Texas subsidiary.", "All three business units are currently suffering some of the lowest returns on equity of any electric utility in America.", "This has caused AEP's overall return on equity to decline from 10.4% in 2016 to just 9.5% in 2017. Note that the average electric utility return on equity in the U.S. is about 9.5%, and analysts are expecting the company's permitted ROE to eventually rise to a long-term average of 10.0%.", "However, there is no guarantee that regulators in key markets will actually allow a greater return on equity.", "That's largely because the nature of this industry is that AEP can pass on almost all costs to consumers, and the company unfortunately has some potentially significant cost uncertainties going forward.", "For one thing, AEP's long-term plans call for legacy coal plants to make up 33% of its energy mix, the majority of its base load power capacity.", "Coal faces far worse economics than gas plants because the U.S. shale gas boom has caused the price of gas to fall by more than 80% in recent years.", "Gas prices are expected to remain very low going forward.", "As a result, AEP's legacy baseload capacity has higher operating costs than many other more gas-focused utilities.", "This might give regulators pause in authorizing a higher return on equity that could mean greater customer rate increases in the future.", "The good news is that American Electric Power's business is spread across 11 different states, so the company is somewhat protected from an unfavorable regulatory outcome in any one region.", "The good news is that American Electric Power's business is spread across 11 different states, so the company is somewhat protected from an unfavorable regulatory outcome in any one region.", "Besides the company's outstanding rate cases, AEP's large capex budget, which will drive long-term earnings and dividend growth, also creates risk.", "If projects get delayed or come in over budget, the utility's customers must pay for it via higher rates.", "Therefore, proper execution on its growth plans is essential to maintaining healthy long-term relations with regulators to prevent unfavorable rate case decisions going forward.", "If projects get delayed or come in over budget, the utility's customers must pay for it via higher rates.", "Therefore, proper execution on its growth plans is essential to maintaining healthy long-term relations with regulators to prevent unfavorable rate case decisions going forward.", "Finally, be aware that because of the highly capital-intensive nature of this business, almost all utilities are sensitivie to interest rates for two main reasons.", "First, rising long-term rates could mean higher borrowing costs. Regulated utilities are allowed to pass these costs onto consumers, so they won't hurt short-term profitability.", "But again, if rates rise too high over time, than regulators are less likely to approve generous returns on equity, so overall profitability and earnings growth can suffer.", "First, rising long-term rates could mean higher borrowing costs. Regulated utilities are allowed to pass these costs onto consumers, so they won't hurt short-term profitability.", "But again, if rates rise too high over time, than regulators are less likely to approve generous returns on equity, so overall profitability and earnings growth can suffer.", "The second way utilities are sensitive to interest rates is that they must fund a small portion of their growth capital spending via new equity issuances.", "American Electric expects to issue $700 million of new shares between 2018 and 2020, representing about 2% dilution, for example.", "It should be noted that most regulated utilities sell 1% to 3% new shares each year, so AEP's equity issuance plans are actually better than average.", "However, most utilities still have their growth potential somewhat at the mercy of fickle equity markets.", "Should long-term interest rates rise at a brisk pace, utility stocks could continue facing pricing pressure as they become relatively less attractive income options compared to risk-free Treasury bonds.", "If their share prices sag, they may need to dilute current investors at a greater rate. In this scenario, AEP's earnings and dividend growth rates could end up missing management guidance and investor expectations.", "AEP's relatively low equity needs and investment grade credit rating reduce this risk, but it's worth keeping in mind for investors who are focused on the utility sector.", "Should long-term interest rates rise at a brisk pace, utility stocks could continue facing pricing pressure as they become relatively less attractive income options compared to risk-free Treasury bonds.", "If their share prices sag, they may need to dilute current investors at a greater rate. In this scenario, AEP's earnings and dividend growth rates could end up missing management guidance and investor expectations.", "AEP's relatively low equity needs and investment grade credit rating reduce this risk, but it's worth keeping in mind for investors who are focused on the utility sector.", "Closing Thoughts on American Electric Power Company", "Regulated utilities can make for a reliable source of safe and growing income. American Electric Power Company has a large, diversified customer base, and its plans to focus 100% on regulated businesses going forward should make it an even more attractive high-yield stock with less fundamental risk.", "The company's current growth plans also represent a logical approach to serving the long-term needs of its customers, including improved transmission reliability, increased power capacity, and the use of cleaner energy sources.", "While AEP certainly faces some regulatory risks in certain markets, its company-wide regulatory profile is about average with solid diversification across states.", "Overall, American Electric Power could be a potentially decent choice for conservative income investors to consider."]}

chemotaxis, phagocytosis, intracellular killing mechanisms, and serum opsonic activity are impaired in diabetic patients (9, 177) and oxidative and nonoxidative antimicrobial mechanisms in neutrophils are also impaired by SCFAs (178).", "Thus, it can be hypothesized that high levels of glucose in chronic wound fluid will stimulate the production of succinate in gram-negative bacteria, which will subsequently impair host cell function and render the host more susceptible to infection.", "Furthermore, since subcutaneous insulin infusion has been associated with improved wound healing, meticulous blood glucose control is considered to be essential in treating diabetic wounds (209).", "High levels of succinic acid (>30 mmol) have been measured in clinical abscesses (87), and neutrophil migration and activity have been impaired in vitro in the presence of >20 mmol of succinate.", "Succinate is also more active at acidic pH, and therefore the hypoxia and low pH associated with many chronic wounds will facilitate succinate activity and hence exacerbate impaired neutrophil function.", "Thus, the quantitative and qualitative aspects of wound microbiology are critical determinants in the development of infection.", "Assuming that the qualitative microbiology remains constant, the probability of wound infection increases as the microbial load increases, up to a critical level where infection or a failure to heal is considered by some to be almost inevitable.", "In theory, the presence of S. aureus and a pigmenting gram-negative anaerobe in a wound is likely to be more detrimental than the presence of a similar quantity of S. aureus alone.", "In the absence of facultative bacteria that can provide the necessary growth factor, a pigmented gram-negative anaerobe may be unable to proliferate and thus to express its full pathogenic potential.", "Therefore, the composition of the polymicrobial wound flora is likely to be more important than the presence

providing information about wounds that are slowly deteriorating or failing to heal.", "From a microbiological perspective, the main pathogens or groups of microorganisms that the microbiology laboratory should routinely detect and report (with antibiograms being provided when appropriate) are as follows: S. aureus, P. aeruginosa, beta-hemolytic streptococci, coliform bacteria, pigmented

infection, and sampling method).", "In this respect, the medical microbiologist may need to interpret the significance of a particular wound pathogen in the light of the clinical presentation.",

microbiological investigation are sampled (i.e., those with clinical signs of infection or those that are failing to heal); (ii) the microbiologist has a thorough understanding of the clinical presentation of the wound; (iii) the microbiologist has an understanding of the method of wound sampling; (iv) the microbiologist is aware of the requirements of the practitioner and the urgency of the results; and (v) the practitioner understands the rationale for advice given by the microbiologist (e.g., the reporting of a mixed aerobic-anaerobic culture from an infected sacral pressure ulcer may not merely indicate a “dirty” wound but may emphasize the significance of microbial synergy; an antibiogram for S. aureus isolated from a mixed culture may not be provided if clinical signs of infection are not evident and if no inflammatory cells are seen in the Gram stain).", "By adopting a collaborative approach to the microbiological management of wound complications, significant savings in cost and time (i.e., nursing, medical, and microbiological) may be achieved while providing prompt and appropriate treatment for the patient.", "As discussed above, the reporting by the microbiology laboratory of specific microorganisms isolated from a wound and the associated antibiograms may be interpreted by the practitioner as a diagnosis of wound infection that requires antimicrobial treatment.", "However, without clinical signs of infection and careful consideration, a wound should not be treated with systemic antibiotics, and it is for this reason that all clinical observations and microbiological findings should be taken into consideration before the medical microbiologist provides an expert opinion.", "Irrespective of the value of a microbiology report to the wound care practitioner, there is widespread debate regarding when and how infected wounds should be treated, whether noninfected, nonhealing wounds should be treated with antimicrobial agents, what agents should be used, and whether topical or systemic antimicrobial agents should be administered.", "Although systemic antibiotic therapy is essential for advancing cutaneous infections and those that involve deeper tissues, wounds that exhibit only localized signs of infection or are failing to heal but do not have clinical signs of infection (i.e., heavy colonization) may initially be treated with topical agents.", "Topical antimicrobial agents include both antiseptics and antibiotics, and the wide choice available creates a further problem to the wound care practitioner.", "Other treatment options such as HBO therapy, which facilitates the host immune response and may also have a direct antimicrobial effect against some anaerobic bacteria (e.g., C. perfringens), antimicrobial peptides, and botanical extracts may also have roles to play in wound management and are worthy of consideration.", "Infected and noninfected, nonhealing wounds can also benefit considerably from surgical debridement, since devitalized tissue both obstructs the healing process and often forms the focus for microbial proliferation.", "As a consequence, surgical debridement will significantly reduce the microbial load as well as exposing healthy tissue required for wound healing.", "Approaches to controlling microbial populations in acute and chronic wounds by use of antimicrobial agents and other means are discussed in more detail below.", "Although the primary purpose of antibiotics is to treat infection, prophylaxis associated with surgical practice accounts for up to half of all antibiotics prescribed (187).", "Most uncomplicated surgical or traumatic wounds heal normally without the need for prophylactic antimicrobial treatment, although the involvement of foreign materials such as sutures, dirt, grafts, or prosthetic devices may increase the risk of infection in clean wounds (187).", "However, in surgical wounds that are potentially heavily contaminated with endogenous aerobic and anaerobic bacteria derived from the disruption of mucosal surfaces (e.g., by gastrointestinal and gynecological surgery) or in severe traumatic wounds that are heavily contaminated with exogenous microorganisms, antibiotic prophylaxis is effective in reducing infection and is recommended as a routine procedure.", "Surgical infections are frequently polymicrobial, and the role of both aerobic and anaerobic bacteria in the pathogenesis of these infections is well recognized (206).", "Synergy between cohabiting bacteria in intra-abdominal infections has also been demonstrated, and the use of broad-spectrum antimicrobial therapy has been shown to be of greatest therapeutic value in these circumstances (86, 206).", "In such situations, perioperative antibiotic prophylaxis is often administered because the potential benefits exceed the perceived risks of excessive antibiotic usage (187).", "It is recommended that prophylaxis be restricted to a single dose of the antibiotic(s) at the beginning of the operation (usually given at the induction of anesthesia) with a maximum of one further dose if surgery is prolonged over 3 to 4 h (222).", "The choice of prophylactic antibiotics should cover both facultative and anaerobic intestinal bacteria.", "The aim is to achieve high concentrations at the time of surgery and throughout the surgical procedure (187).", "In established mixed infections, failure to target both facultative and anaerobic bacteria often leads to a poor clinical outcome (86).", "Poor success rates have been demonstrated with the use of metronidazole or clindamycin alone, targeting only the anaerobic components, in the treatment of serious abdominal infections (86).", "Combination therapy with an aminoglycoside (e.g., gentamicin) or a cephalosporin (e.g., cefuroxime or cefotaxime) plus clindamycin or metronidazole has proved to be very effective.", "The cephamycin agent cefoxitin has been widely used as a single agent for prophylaxis in the United States and for the treatment of established infection.", "The subsequent development of new classes of antibiotics such as the ureidopenicillins, the carbapenems, and the β-lactam/β-lactamase inhibitor combinations has expanded the choice for both prophylactic and therapeutic treatment.", "Particularly in contaminated surgery, where excessive populations of gram-negative bacteria are likely to be present, careful selection of antibiotics is required since some are known to influence endotoxin liberation and hence septic shock (187).", "Antibiotics that target the bacterial cell wall liberate larger amounts of endotoxin than do other classes of antibiotics, such as those that inhibit protein synthesis (187).", "Conversely, polymyxin B and the glycopeptide teicoplanin have the ability to neutralize endotoxin, and vancomycin has been shown to down-regulate lipopolysaccharide-induced tumor necrosis factor alpha production from monocytes and is thus beneficial in the treatment of sepsis (187).", "Since S. aureus is considered to be the most problematic pathogen associated with infected traumatic wounds (71, 187), cephalosporins, macrolides, clindamycin, and semisynthetic penicillins such as flucloxacillin and oxacillin are often treatments of choice (71).", "If methicillin-resistant strains are involved, the glycopeptide antibiotics vancomycin and teicoplanin are alternatives (187).", "Like contaminated surgical wounds, the majority of chronic wounds (e.g., leg ulcers, foot ulcers, and pressure ulcers) are characterized by a polymicrobial aerobic-anaerobic microflora.", "Consequently, the careful use of broad-spectrum antimicrobial agents is likely to be the most successful treatment in the management of clinically infected chronic wounds.", "The presence of anaerobic bacteria in foot ulcers of diabetic patients has been associated with a greater likelihood of the patient becoming febrile, developing a more serious deep-wound infection, and requiring amputation (84).", "Goldstein (84) emphasized the importance of broad-spectrum antibiotics in the treatment of nonsurgical infections and suggested the use of cefoxitin, imipenem, or ticarcillin-clavulanate as sole agents, with other agents being used in combination, including metronidazole or clindamycin for the anaerobic component.", "Although the use of metronidazole alone to treat abdominal infections is unsuccessful, in vitro studies have demonstrated that protection of facultative bacteria from phagocytosis was prevented when the anaerobic component was eliminated following treatment with metronidazole (114).", "Consequently, in theory, an alternative prophylactic approach to disrupting synergy and enhanced pathogenicity in polymicrobial wounds may be to treat the patient with an anaerobicidal antibiotic such as metronidazole and depend on the disruption of synergy and the up-regulation of the host defense mechanisms to eliminate the facultative bacteria.", "However, this mechanism of action has not been clinically proven, and studies are required to evaluate the overall antimicrobial effect of metronidazole treatment and its role in wound healing.", "Recent guidelines on the treatment of pressure ulcers issued by the European Pressure Ulcer Advisory Panel recommended that systemic antibiotics not be required for pressure ulcers that exhibit only clinical signs of local infection (72).", "Since leg ulcers and foot ulcers often exhibit a similar microflora to pressure ulcers, such advice could probably be extended to cover a wider variety of chronic wound types.", "In the absence of advancing cellulitis, bacteremia, fever, or pain, topical antimicrobial agents (antibiotics or antiseptics) may offer the most useful first line of treatment.", "If a wound fails to improve after an initial course of topical treatment (e.g., 2 weeks), continued use is not likely to be of benefit.", "Alternative topical agents may be considered at this point unless clinical signs of infection are progressing, in which case systemic antibiotic therapy should be considered.", "At this stage, microbiological data are likely to be available to guide systemic therapy.", "The use of broad-spectrum topical antibiotics to treat wounds that are failing to heal or wounds that are at risk of infection is justified on the basis that they provide a high concentration at the local site, they avoid systemic allergic reactions (22), and they also avoid more-widespread effects on endogenous bacteria (e.g., disturbance of the normal commensal microflora or the action of induced resistance).", "However, the probability of a successful outcome in chronic wounds may be compromised by the presence of ischemic and necrotic tissue which may impair tissue distribution and therapeutic efficacy of the drug.", "Antibiotics used topically are generally restricted to those that are toxic when administered systemically.", "Bacitracin, polymyxin B, and neomycin are used as double or triple topical antibiotic combinations to provide an appropriate spectrum of activity.", "Other topical agents such as mupirocin and fusidic acid are rarely used in wounds but are most frequently used to treat superficial skin infections caused by S. aureus or in the elimination of staphylococcal carriage.", "Metronidazole in a gel or solution formulation at a concentration of approximately 8,000 μg/ml is specifically used to eliminate anaerobic bacteria responsible for the offensive malodor in many chronic wound types, including ulcerated malignant tumors.", "Also, anecdotal evidence indicates that metronidazole may have a direct effect in improving wound healing (10, 85, 228, 246).", "In addition to antibiotic therapy, wound cleansing and surgical debridement may assist antibiotic treatment by reducing the microbial load, and hence the opportunity for infection, and enabling better penetration of antibiotics to where they are needed.", "Delayed wound closure may also be considered to allow time for antimicrobial therapy to reduce the microbial load, without which healing may not progress, and also to avoid the accumulation of a blood clot in tissue debris, which is ideal for microbial growth (204, 205).", "(iv) Role of the microbiology laboratory in guiding antibiotic treatment in wound management.", "As discussed above, in rapidly progressing soft tissue infections such as necrotizing fasciitis, empirical therapy is essential and consequently the microbiology laboratory has a minimal role to play in assisting clinicians in their immediate choice of early treatment (183).", "However, microbiological data are important in confirming subsequently that the chosen regimen is appropriate.", "In contrast, in wounds that are failing to heal or have a more prolonged chronic infection, the microbiologist can have an important role to play in advising on whether to treat a wound and, if so, on the choice of antibiotic treatment.", "Most clinicians prescribe broad-spectrum antimicrobial agents before reviewing a microbiology report, and in many cases the treatment may be inappropriate or may not be necessary, and this can have a serious impact on hospital budgets.", "Furthermore, broad-spectrum antibiotics can adversely affect the normal gastrointestinal microflora, possibly predisposing patients to Clostridium difficile colitis and selecting for resistance in some bacterial strains (e.g., vancomycin resistant Enterococcus) (183).", "Based on information received regarding the site of wound infection and clinical symptoms, the role of the microbiology laboratory is to determine the clinically significant isolates, perform antimicrobial susceptibility testing, and subsequently provide guidance on the most appropriate treatment (242).", "Not only will this assistance facilitate successful wound management but also it will assist in the control of antibiotic usage and hence stem the spread of antibiotic-resistant bacteria.", "Antibiotic susceptibility of wound isolates observed in the laboratory cannot always be related directly to the clinical situation since the in vitro and in vivo conditions vary considerably.", "The number of organisms at the infected site may be significantly different from the standard inoculum size used in vitro, the wound pH is likely to differ from test pH, and the pharmacokinetics and conditions at the infected site are also likely to influence microbial susceptibility in vivo (242).", "It is therefore important to consider that laboratory data may not always translate to therapeutic success.", "Unlike antibiotics, antiseptics are chemical agents that are potentially toxic to both microbial cells and host cells.", "Therefore, their use is limited to topical application to wounds and intact skin. Wounds that are most likely to benefit from topical antiseptic treatment are primarily those of a traumatic or chronic nature that are heavily contaminated with a variety of microorganisms and are failing to heal, with or without clinical signs of infection.", "Commonly used topical antiseptic agents include iodine-releasing agents (e.g., povidone iodine [PVP-I] and cadexomer iodine), chlorine-releasing solutions (e.g., Dakin's solution and sodium hypochlorite solution), hydrogen peroxide, chlorhexidine, silver-releasing agents, and acetic acid.", "In terms of efficacy, acetic acid (1%) has limited activity but has been used with greatest success in the management of wounds heavily colonized with P. aeruginosa (189).", "Silver-releasing agents, particularly silver sulfadiazine (1%), have historically been used to treat P. aeruginosa infection in patients with burn wounds, although the spectrum of activity is capable of controlling a variety of common wound pathogens (152).", "Hadjiiski (93) reported that a 1% silver sulphadiazine cream (Flamazine) was more effective than PVP-I in preventing infection in burn wounds prior to skin grafting.", "Although iodine is perhaps the most potent and broad-spectrum antiseptic agent, its use in wound management is controversial because some iodine formulations (e.g., PVP-I) have been shown, in vitro, to impair the functioning of cells involved in normal wound healing (48).", "However, this effect has not been observed in vivo when it was used at concentrations lower than 1% (48).", "Despite the highly efficacious antimicrobial properties of PVP-I and hence the potential to significantly reduce the microbial load in wounds, accelerated healing has not been observed in experimental and clinical studies (48).", "This implies either that the PVP-I does not demonstrate in vivo antimicrobial efficacy (possibly due to inactivation by organic material) or that the beneficial effects are counterbalanced by the cytotoxic effects (48).", "A recent review of the literature that specifically addressed in vivo animal and human studies, concluded that the use of PVP-I was associated with poor wound healing in the majority of cases (125).", "In recent years, improved formulations that are able to release low levels of iodine over a sustained period have been shown to be highly effective against wound pathogens while not impairing wound healing (161).", "The sustained release of iodine also overcomes the neutralizing effect that organic material in wounds has on iodine activity.", "Similarly, a recently described enzyme-catalyzed iodine formulation, capable of generating high concentrations of molecular iodine while forming relatively low levels of total iodine, has been shown to elicit greater microbicidal activity than a PVP-I solution and has an effect comparable to normal saline on the rate of epithelialization in superficial wounds in pigs (106).", "An extensive review of the literature supports the use of cadexomer iodine as a safe, effective, and economical treatment in a variety of chronic wound types (227), and the same agent has been shown to specifically prevent the proliferation of methicillin-resistant S. aureus in partial-thickness experimental wounds (161).", "Experts in the field consider iodine to have an important role to play in wound management, as concluded at a recent consensus meeting sponsored by the European Tissue Repair Society (79).", "Although the prophylactic role of iodine in acute surgical wounds is widely supported in the literature, there is minimal evidence to support its use in chronic-wound prophylaxis (79).", "However, topical iodine antisepsis should be considered for nonhealing wounds, with or without clinical signs of infection (79).", "The primary concern regarding the use of iodine-containing formulations is toxicity and its associated effects on wound healing.", "However, most of these concerns are based on in vitro data that may not be relevant to the clinical situation, and the newer, slow-release iodine formulations appear to be both safe and effective (79).", "As the development of bacterial resistance to antibiotics continues and controversy regarding the use of topical antiseptics persists, the need for identification and development of new antimicrobial agents that are safe and broadly effective and have a low propensity to induce resistance becomes increasingly critical.", "In recent years, widespread interest has focused on a class of naturally occurring peptides that protect a variety of animals from infection.", "These peptides are found in a variety of cell types and operate by attaching to microbial cells, perforating the cell wall, and inducing leakage of cell contents.", "Such pore-forming antimicrobial peptides are widespread throughout nature: human neutrophils produce defensins, magainins have been isolated from the skin of the African clawed frog, and cecropins have a similar function in the giant silkworm moth (55).", "The opportunity to synthesize more potent and broad-spectrum analogues of the natural endogenous peptides has been recognized by pharmaceutical companies, and topical formulations are now in development for indications such as infected diabetic foot ulcers (90).", "Concern over the use of antibiotics and the search for new antimicrobial agents has also led to the reemergence of therapies that have been used for centuries but have become less fashionable during the antibiotic era.", "The use of fly maggots to treat infected and necrotic wounds is being increasingly acknowledged and will be discussed as a biosurgical form of wound debridement in a later section.", "Other resurgent topical therapies include botanical extracts and honey.", "Modern-day recognition of the therapeutic value of essential oils extracted from plants (aromatherapy) dates back to 1928, when a French chemist observed the healing capacity of lavender oil following a burn injury to his hand (14).", "Many essential oils possess antimicrobial properties, and tea tree oil in particular (derived from the Australian native plant Melaleuca alternifolia) has been recognized for its efficacy against methicillin-resistant S. aureus and has consequently been considered as an alternative treatment for mupirocin-resistant methicillin-resistant S. aureus (49).", "However, despite the potential for novel agents such as tea tree oil, their acceptance and use in wound management will be limited until adequate safety and clinical efficacy data have been generated.", "Honey is another ancient remedy that is gaining renewed popularity as alternative treatments for antibiotic-resistant bacteria are pursued.", "Both honey and sugar paste are considered useful as topical antimicrobial agents, primarily as a consequence of their high osmolarity and ability to minimize water availability to bacteria (163).", "Although the dilution of honey in the presence of wound fluid is likely to reduce the efficacy of its osmotic effect, the slow and sustained production of hydrogen peroxide by some types of honey (e.g., manuka honey) is capable of maintaining an antimicrobial effect at a concentration approximately 1,000-fold lower than that commonly used in antiseptics (i.e., 3%) (163).", "Also, components of manuka honey such as flavonoids and aromatic acids, demonstrate antimicrobial properties (163).", "Honey is also an effective wound deodorizing agent, and this effect has been attributed to the rich supply of glucose that is metabolized by bacteria in preference to proteinaceous necrotic tissue, resulting in the production of lactic acid and not the malodorous compounds generated by protein degradation (163).", "The observed benefits of honey in infected wounds may also be attributed to the high glucose content and low pH, both of which are stimulatory to macrophages (56).", "Despite the multifactorial benefits of certain types of honey in the management of many wound types, widespread acceptability is likely to be slow at best.", "This assumption is based on the fact that such therapy is ancient and therefore represents a regressive step rather than advancing toward new and innovative therapies, and it is also based on the wide variation in potency that exists in honeys derived from different floral sources (163).", "Wounds often fail to heal because the tissue is ischemic and consequently starved of oxygen, nutrients, and host defense cells that are essential to the healing process.", "Combined with impaired oxygen delivery, microbial and host cell metabolism within the wound space rapidly leads to the formation of a hypoxic or anoxic environment.", "Aerobic respiration yields approximately 17 times more energy per molecule metabolized than does anaerobic respiration (219), and consequently cellular responses to tissue injury (e.g., leukocyte function, fibroblast proliferation, granulation, angiogenesis, and collagen deposition) are enhanced in the presence of oxygen (244).", "Furthermore, a hypoxic environment will facilitate the growth of anaerobic bacteria and impair the PMN oxygen-dependent antimicrobial mechanisms that are essential in reducing the opportunity for infection (244).", "Sheffield (218) suggested that the severity of the problem in a nonhealing wound is partially proportional to the degree of tissue hypoxia.", "During normal wound healing, the deposition of a collagen matrix forms a scaffold that supports new blood vessels (angiogenesis), and these, in turn, enable the delivery of oxygen and nutrients required to maintain the healing process (248).", "Angiogenesis is driven by an oxygen gradient between peripheral normal tissue and the wound space (124), and some treatments capable of exaggerating the gradient have been shown to enhance the angiogenic response.", "In a porcine full-thickness wound model, Lydon et al. (144) demonstrated increased blood vessel counts and perfusion in wounds that were treated with an occlusive dressing (i.e., one that excluded environmental oxygen and thus increased the oxygen gradient) compared with dressings that were exposed to air.", "HBO therapy, involving the intermittent inhalation of pure oxygen (100%) at a pressure greater than 1 atm (136), has also been used in wound management to increase tissue oxygen tension and hence promote angiogenesis, fibroblast proliferation, and PMN microbicidal efficacy (248).", "However, the value of HBO therapy in wound healing is controversial, and in order to prevent indiscriminate use, the Committee on Hyperbaric Oxygenation (established in 1976) restricted HBO therapy to four wound categories, namely, acute traumatic ischemias (e.g., crush injuries), clostridial myonecrosis, necrotizing soft tissue infections, and selected nonhealing problem wounds (53).", "In a study involving 10 patients with lower-extremity diabetic wounds, HBO therapy was shown to increase the peri-wound oxygen tension from an initial mean of 12 mm Hg to 560 mm Hg, which resulted in a more rapid reduction in the wound area (248).", "Similarly, it has been suggested that HBO therapy improves healing in diabetic foot ulcers when it is used as an adjunct to broad-spectrum antibiotics, aggressive surgical debridement (to preserve the peripheral circulation), and adequate metabolic control (136).", "However, in general, HBO therapy has not been widely accepted as a standard treatment for chronic nonhealing wounds, and this is due, in no small part, to the lack of a body of evidence from structured randomized clinical trials in this area.", "In a retrospective evaluation of 54 patients with lower-extremity nonhealing wounds of varied etiology, 80% showed no improvement after 30 treatment sessions (53).", "From this study, Ciaravino et al. (53) concluded that because of the expense (average cost of $14,000 per complete treatment), poor efficacy, and potential complications, HBO therapy was difficult to justify.", "To date, the majority of studies involving nonhealing wounds have been performed without good scientific rationale (53), precise wound-healing measures, or well-defined wound-healing end points (245).", "Also, since adequate tissue perfusion is a prerequisite for HBO therapy to have any beneficial effect in the treatment of lower-extremity wounds, HBO therapy cannot be used as a substitute for surgical revascularisation in patients with advanced arterial insufficiency (53).", "Well-perfused wounds that are deteriorating or failing to heal and acute, rapidly advancing soft tissue infections such as necrotizing fasciitis meet these criteria and are thus likely to gain most benefit from HBO therapy.", "Polymicrobial aerobic-anaerobic interactions are known to contribute significantly to the progression and severity of disease in acute soft tissue infections (12).", "In such situations, HBO therapy is likely to be of benefit by both directly inhibiting anaerobic bacteria (and possibly thereby reducing the level of virulence caused by aerobic-anaerobic synergistic interactions) and optimizing the antimicrobial efficacy of PMNs (11).", "In rapidly progressing soft tissue infections, aggressive surgical debridement, together with broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy, is critical.", "Although no large prospective clinical trials have been performed to evaluate the role of HBO therapy, several studies have demonstrated that such adjunctive therapy can significantly reduce mortality and wound morbidity (12, 153, 191).", "In particular, the value of HBO therapy has been recognized in cases of clostridial myonecrosis (gas gangrene), since the potent alpha-toxin (lecithinase) produced by C. perfringens (type A) is inactivated at a tissue oxygen tension of greater than 33 kPa (11).", "However, the acceptance of HBO therapy in the treatment of necrotizing soft tissue infections is not universal, and Elliot et al.", "(69) concluded, from a retrospective study, that it provided no survival benefit although it may hasten wound closure.", "Most recently, Clark and Moon (54) formed the opinion that on the basis of in vitro data and growing evidence from retrospective clinical studies, HBO therapy is a valuable adjunct to surgical debridement and antibiotic therapy in the treatment of life-threatening soft tissue infections.", "Surgical wounds may also benefit from supplemental oxygen. Elevation of the oxygen tension in perfused tissue during colorectal surgery by the administration of 80% inspired oxygen has been shown to significantly reduce the incidence of postoperative wound infection (91).", "While the pharmacologic maintenance of a manageable bacterial burden may prove to be of central importance in wound healing, it is an adjunct in an overall regimen that includes debridement and appropriate protection or pressure off-loading.", "This section will evaluate nonantimicrobial methods of treatment, including surgical, enzymatic, autolytic, and biological debridement, as well as the importance of pressure reduction and off-loading in wounds whose prime etiology is repetitive stress (as occurs with the diabetic foot ulcer).", "Debridement involves the removal of devitalized and contaminated tissue from wounds to expose healthier tissue and facilitate wound healing (240).", "Devitalized tissue provides a favorable environment for microbial growth, and thus its removal will also reduce the microbial load and microbially induced malodor and will minimise the opportunity for wound infection.", "Surgical (sharp) debridement has been the mainstay of treatment for wounds of various etiologies. The rationale behind the necessity for periodic surgical debridement has been largely anecdotal but centers around the limitation of undermining, the promotion of an adherent wound margin and subsequently a favorable environment for epithelial cell migration, and the reduction of the bacterial burden (5, 224).", "In a survey of two diabetic foot speciality clinics, Frykberg (77) reported a shorter healing time in the surgically oriented center.", "Steed et al. (224), in a subanalysis of a multicenter randomized clinical trial of recombinant platelet-derived growth factor, reported that centers that regularly debrided wounds had a higher proportion of subjects heal in both the active growth factor and placebo gel vehicle arms.", "A variety of autolytic and enzymatic dressings and topical modalities have been in use for over a generation.", "While a body of work exists to support their use as an adjunct, there is little objective clinical evidence to support their use as a primary means of debriding wounds.", "The theory surrounding autolytic debridement stems from the concept that some dressings tend to provide the moist environment needed to activate endogenous enzymes that promote the autolysis of fibrin and facilitate extracellular matrix turnover and maintenance (52, 168, 169).", "In a clinical trial of 30 patients with pressure ulcers, Barr et al. (15) found that wounds that were surgically debrided prior to the use of autolytic debridement (delivered via a hydrocolloid-alginate dressing) showed a significantly better clinical response than if they received autolytic debridement alone.", "There are additional reports to suggest that the risk for infection may be reduced through the use of a barrier-type dressing with autolytic properties in contrast to a nonocclusive dressing such as gauze (148, 221).", "Clearly, however, there is a need for more objective study in this area to determine the clinical utility of autolytic and enzymatic debridement both combined with and independent of standard surgical debridement (3).", "From a microbiological perspective, since autologous debridement does not involve the physical removal of devitalized tissue (until cleansing at dressing change), this method is unlikely to be as effective as surgical debridement in reducing the microbial load and hence the risk of wound infection.", "Prior to the advent of antibiotic therapy, the use of larvae (maggots) as an effective method of wound debridement (162, 170) was routine.", "Much of the early work detailing the breeding and application of the larvae was performed by one man, Stanton Livingston, at and around the time of the Great War (89, 140, 141).", "Although biosurgical debridement has played a minor role in wound management during the last 50 years, its popularity has gradually increased again during the 1990s as alternative treatments have been sought in an attempt to combat the surge in infections caused by antibiotic-resistant bacteria.", "Larval therapy is currently being used in the treatment of a variety of infected acute and chronic wounds, including those colonized by resistant bacteria such as methicillin-resistant S. aureus (233, 234).", "The fly maggots of the common greenbottle, Lucilia sericata, are capable of physically and enzymatically degrading devitalized tissue in a safe and effective way.", "During this process, potentially pathogenic bacteria may be destroyed as part of the natural feeding process, but endogenous antimicrobial secretions are also considered to play an important role in microbial elimination (233, 234).", "Additional data suggest that fly larvae may stimulate fibroblast proliferation in vitro (193).", "As with autolytic and enzymatic debridement, the medical literature is replete with isolated case reports, and again, there are few data to concisely compare outcomes to other modes of therapy.", "With the exception of burn wounds, pressure and duration of pressure application are prime factors in the pathogenesis of the majority of wounds treated today.", "Therefore, it would stand to reason that mitigation of these stresses is important in the healing of these wounds.", "While seemingly disconnected from the microbiology of wound care, a closer inspection may prove that mechanical care of the wound and infection may be more intimately related.", "Certainly, wounds in which pressure is not off-loaded appropriately may take longer to heal and therefore may be exposed to a greater risk of infection (167).", "The literature describing areas in which the pressure reduction component of treatment is relevant is quite extensive.", "In this review, we will focus on one very challenging clinical situation, off-loading the diabetic foot ulcer to reduce pressure stresses.", "While many methods have been used to protect the lower extremity from high repetitive pressures (e.g., bed rest, non-weight bearing, crutch assistance, and prostheses), many of these approaches have proven impractical.", "Most ambulatory patients with wounds in weight-bearing regions, such as the sole of the foot, developed those wounds because of neurological sensory damage.", "Therefore, the normal nociceptive feedback that would deter activity in the sensate individual is absent, thereby removing perhaps the biggest ally of the clinician attempting to prevent further damage to the wound—pain.", "Based on the above-mentioned frequent lack of painful feedback, comprehensive off-loading strategies for persons with wounds in weight-bearing areas have faced a conundrum: the desire to ensure frequent surveillance and care of the wound (e.g., ease of removal of the off-loading device) and the desire to ensure compliance with off-loading (e.g., making the device difficult to remove).", "This has led to two major categories of off-loading devices: removable and nonremovable devices. While there is a paucity of comparative trials evaluating these devices in a randomized fashion, a guide to the results of various reports is given in Table 5.", "While one cannot draw sharp conclusions from these reports (primarily due to significant differences in methods and populations), the consistency in the duration to healing with the total-contact cast has led to its being considered the “gold standard” in terms of its quality of off-loading (131) and duration to healing (3, 7, 51, 103, 104, 108, 129, 167, 171, 220, 241).", "| Modality | Author (reference) | Type of ulcer | Mean healing time (days) | % Healed |", "| Total-contact cast | Myerson (171) | Wagner grade I and II | 30 (forefoot ulcers), 63 (midfoot and rearfoot ulcers) | 90 |", "| Total-contact cast | Helm (103) | Wagner grade I, II, and III | 38.3 | 72.7 |", "| Total-contact cast | Mueller (167) | Wagner grade I and II | 42 | 90 |", "| Total-contact cast | Sinacore (220) | NRb | 43.6 | 81.8 |", "| Total-contact cast | Walker (241) | Wagner grade I, II, and III | 30.57 (forefoot ulcers), 42.08 (nonforefoot ulcers) | NR |", "| Total-contact cast | Armstrong (7) | UT grade Ia | 38.8 | 100 |", "| Total-contact cast | Lavery (129) | UT grade Ia | 28.4 (midfoot ulcers) | 100 |", "| Half-shoe | Chantelau (51) | Apelqvist grade I, II, III, and IV | 70 (median healing time) | 96 |", "Reprinted from reference 6 with permission of the publisher.", "Another recently introduced perspective to pressure reduction in wounds involves the application of subatmospheric pressure.", "Essentially, a sterile open foam dressing is applied to a wound, which is then closed to the external environment to enable the application of a low-level vacuum (125 mm Hg) (164).", "This type of system has been used to good effect in the treatment of a variety of wound types and has been shown to reduce interstitial pressure, restore blood flow, and remove cell-inhibitory factors within chronic wound fluid.", "Additionally, vacuum-assisted wound closure has been shown to reduce the bacterial load in tissue 1,000-fold after 4 days of treatment in an experimental infected wound model (164) and also to be of benefit in the management of deep sternal wound infection (232).", "As well as the need to control microbial populations that exist in wounds in order to minimize the likelihood of wound infection, there is a need to control the dissemination of potentially pathogenic members of the wound microflora into the surrounding environment in order to minimize the opportunity for cross-infection.", "In this respect, wound dressings should be considered an important infection control tool, since many are able to physically prevent the transmission of pathogenic bacteria and blood-borne viruses (30, 66, 115, 134, 160).", "Dressings that are capable of maintaining a moist wound environment have also been shown to minimize airborne dispersal of microorganisms from burn wounds at the time the dressing is removed (133) and also to reduce the wound infection rate (24, 113, 127).", "Dermal wounds involve exposed tissue, which, under normal circumstances would be sterile, i.e., free from microbial contamination.", "However, like normal intact skin, a newly formed wound will naturally become colonized by microorganisms and compromised tissue will encourage their proliferation.", "In addition to the warm, moist, and nutritious conditions, ischemic wounds (usually chronic) are often characterized by tissue hypoxia, necrosis, and an impaired immune response.", "Consequently, commensal aerobic and anaerobic microfloras of the human body (with primary sources being the skin, the oral cavity, the gut, and the genitourinary tract) are presented with an opportunity to become established in an abnormal but favorable environment, where their survival strategies may render them pathogenic rather than commensal.", "Since microorganisms from a variety of sources are presented with an opportunity to colonize a common but unnatural habitat, microbial interactions unique to this particular environment may significantly influence wound pathogenesis and healing.", "The majority of open wounds are polymicrobial. A review of the literature indicates that anaerobic bacteria constitute, on average, one-third of the total number of microbial species in colonized wounds, and this number increases to approximately 50% in infected wounds.", "Therefore, antimicrobial treatment of clinically infected and/or nonhealing polymicrobial wounds should cover a variety of potentially synergistic aerobic or facultative and anaerobic microorganisms and should not simply target specific pathogens that are often perceived to be the causative agents (e.g., S. aureus and P. aeruginosa).", "The progression of a colonized wound to an infected state cannot be predicted by the presence of a specific type of bacterium or a specific pathophysiological condition, because a multitude of factors are likely to simultaneously influence wound pathogenesis.", "Microbiological factors such as the population density, the types of microorganisms present, and microbial interactions and host factors such as the efficacy of the immune response and the condition of the tissue are all critical and must be considered collectively as factors predisposing to infection.", "Clinical studies have demonstrated that a measure of the tissue microbial load in a wound can predict delayed healing or infection.", "The quantitative tissue biopsy specimen technique is probably most useful in traumatic or surgical wounds to determine the correct time for wound closure or grafting, but its value in the routine management of chronic, nonhealing wounds is less practical.", "The swab sampling technique is also considered to have limitations, in particular the fact that it collects superficial contaminants that do not reflect the deeper, infecting microorganisms.", "However, since synergy undoubtedly occurs in polymicrobial wounds, superficial microorganisms may well contribute to wound pathogenesis.", "Superficial sampling can provide qualitative and quantitative or semiquantitative data, and correlations between tissue counts and superficial swab counts have been demonstrated.", "Although superficial sampling can be performed by personnel without surgical expertise and does not involve tissue invasion or trauma to the patient, its widespread and unconditional use should be challenged.", "In this respect, it is the opinion of the authors that only wounds that are clinically infected or those that have no clinical signs of infection but are deteriorating or have a long history of failing to heal merit superficial swab sampling for microbiological analysis.", "In the laboratory, microbiological analysis must be guided by the clinical information provided (e.g., type and site of wound, associated malodor, signs of infection, antibiotic therapy) in order to ensure that meaningful results can be provided in as short a time as possible.", "As an example, an antibiogram for S. aureus isolated from a mixed culture should not be provided if clinical signs of infection are not evident and if no inflammatory cells are seen in the Gram stain.", "Similarly, the reporting of a mixed aerobic-anaerobic culture from an infected sacral pressure ulcer may not merely indicate a “dirty,” fecally-contaminated, and poorly sampled wound but may, in fact, indicate the potential for enhanced pathogenicity caused by microbial synergy.", "Consequently, to minimize the opportunity for wound infection and exclude microorganisms as a factor in delayed healing in noninfected wounds, a multidisciplinary approach to wound management, involving a continuous dialogue between laboratory and clinical staff, is vital.", "From a practical perspective, controlling the microbial load in wounds is a vital factor in minimizing infection, and this can be achieved in several ways.", "Antimicrobial agents (antibiotics) are primarily used either prophylactically in the treatment of wounds that are likely to be heavily contaminated following surgery or therapeutically in the treatment of clinically infected wounds.", "Since both aerobic and anaerobic pathogens may contribute to infection in polymicrobial wounds (often via synergistic interactions), broad-spectrum antibiotics provide the most successful treatment.", "Wounds that are heavily contaminated (e.g., chronic or acute traumatic), are failing to heal and possibly deteriorating, but have only local or no clinical signs of infection may benefit from topical antibiotic or antiseptic therapy.", "Although topical antibiotics are selectively toxic to bacteria rather than to host tissue, they are likely to induce bacterial resistance, and for this reason antiseptics are more frequently used topically.", "However, prolonged antiseptic use may compromise host tissue viability and hence counteract the promotion of healing induced by the antimicrobial effect.", "HBO therapy has also been used to treat a variety of oxygen-compromised (hypoxic) acute and chronic wound types.", "In theory, HBO therapy stimulates cellular processes involved in wound healing, directly impairs the growth of anaerobic pathogens, and enhances the potency of the oxygen-dependent antimicrobial mechanisms in PMNs.", "Although there is currently a paucity of prospective, controlled clinical data regarding the efficacy of HBO therapy, its usefulness as an adjunct to surgical debridement and antibiotic therapy has been demonstrated, particularly in some of the aggressive necrotizing soft tissue infections.", "Surgical debridement of compromised (nonviable) tissue not only exposes the healthy, perfused tissue required to initiate wound healing but also effectively removes the majority of microbial contaminants and any associated malodor, thus reducing the risk of infection.", "Biosurgical debridement,

of wounds has been actively researched in recent years, there is still much to be learned about the microbial mechanisms that induce infection and prevent wound healing.", "Consequently, debate

At Groupe level, we ranked first globally as highlighted in several reports, including JPMorgan and Goldman Sachs.", "Publicis Media is leading the media industry as stated in RECMA’s ranking. Finally, in the creative field, our two biggest networks Publicis Worldwide and Leo Burnett ranked first and second respectively in R3’s new business reports.", "Our model connecting data, dynamic creativity and technology is working beautifully and fits the current and future needs of the clients.", "This is why we won the majority of the biggest pitches of 2018, such as Daimler, Campbell's, Marriott, Carrefour, Cathay Pacific, Smucker's, GSK and Fiat-Chrysler.", "These last two wins represent more than one billion dollars in billings each.", "Second, we over-delivered financially while we were transforming.", "We improved operating margin rate by 60 bps compared with 2017 reported figure, above our objective of a 30 to 50 basis point increase.", "Operating margin rate reached 16.7 % before IFRS16. It is important to mention that we did not deliver this performance at the expense of tomorrow’s growth.", "We realized 194 million euros of savings, thanks to all our work on structure simplification and the rightsizing of some operations.", "Out of this amount, 109 million euros were reinvested in our talents and our game changers.", "Headline diluted EPS grew by 10.3 % at constant currency, above the top end of our target of 5 % to 10 % growth.", "Therefore, we will propose a 2.12 euro dividend per share representing a 45% pay out as committed at the investor day.", "Finally, free cash flow remained very strong above 1.3 billion euros, fueled by a positive change in working capital for the second year in a row.", "This allowed us to turn net cash positive at 196 million euros at the end of 2018, only four years after the 3-billion-euro acquisition of Sapient.", "This is a big strength at this time of economic uncertainty.

When PHS is factored out, growth was +0.5% in the fourth quarter.", "Growth was therefore slower than in Q3 due to negative impact of the usual year-end volatility and the higher-than-expected rate of attrition in the traditional advertising business, notably in the FMCG sector in the US.", "Organic growth nonetheless benefited from the ramp-up of accounts won in Q1 2018 - notably those of Daimler, Carrefour, Campbell’s and Marriott – which contributed 150 basis points.", "Publicis Groupe’s Net revenue for the full year 2018 was 8,969 million euro, compared with 9,332 million euro in 2017, i.e. a 3.9% decrease.", "At constant exchange rates, growth was +0.1% but the actual impact of exchange rate variations was a negative 4.0% or 374 million euro.", "Net acquisitions contributed 5 million euro to Net revenue in 2018 (including the deconsolidation of Genedigi from January 1, 2018).", "Organic growth was +0.1% in 2018. It was +0.8% without PHS.

This entity services CSOs (Contract Sales Organizations), a business that does not exist in other healthcare communications networks that mainly specialize in outsourcing.", "By its very nature, this business is highly volatile and developments in the healthcare sector have led clients to make last-minute adjustments resulting in the postponement or even the cancellation of campaigns.", "The pharmaceutical industry is undergoing radical transformation throughout the world. At a time when medical research and sales have moved on from the blockbuster era to one of more specialized therapies, it has become necessary to adapt its marketing and to propose measures that target patients and prescribers much more specifically.", "Publicis Groupe’s offering – which is articulated around data, dynamic creativity and digital business transformation – is clearly aligned with these needs.", "Publicis Groupe remains determined to provide its clients with the best possible offering for their digital transformation and this will require investment in healthcare-related consulting, data and technology.", "Europe reported growth of +1.0%. However, when changes in scope of consolidation, exchange rates and PHS are all factored out, growth stands at +1.3%.", "Growth has accelerated since the end of June, mainly due to the ramp-up of accounts gained in the earlier part of the year, particularly Daimler and Carrefour.", "This is the broader context within which Germany returned to positive growth, especially in the second half of the year (+10.9% in Q4), whilst growth accelerated in France (+3.8% for the full year, after +0.7% at June 30) and in the UK (+3.8% for the full year versus +1.8% at June 30).", "North America posted organic growth of -0.8% in 2018. When the impact of PHS is factored out, organic growth stands at +0.5% thanks to accounts awarded in 2017 (including McDonald’s, Diesel, Lionsgate, Molson Coors and Southwest) and the win of Campbell's and Marriott in early 2018, and despite pressures in the traditional advertising.", "North America is impacted by the difficulties encountered by Publicis Health Services where the decline in Net revenue adversely affected growth by approximately 130 basis points in 2018.", "Given the impact of exchange rates, North America reported a 4.7% decline in Net revenue by comparison with 2017.", "Asia Pacific reported growth of -10.9% and organic growth of -1.8%. Most of this negative performance was due to Australia (-4.7%), which was affected in the first half-year by the non-renewal by Qantas of its call center management contract.", "China saw its growth decline slightly (-1.3%) due to the loss of certain accounts. Singapore saw its Net revenue grow by 3.9% in 2018.", "Latin America was down 10.3% mainly due to exchange rates, but posted organic growth of +4.5%. Brazil saw its Net revenue progress by 1.1% thanks to the gain of the Petrobras and Bradesco accounts.", "The slowdown in the fourth quarter was due to the cancellation of several campaigns by clients.

At constant exchange rates and the same scope of consolidation, this increase would have been 30 basis points.", "This was made possible by the decrease in restructuring costs (10 basis points) but also by the cost savings plans deployed over the last 18 months (210 basis points), i.e. 194 million euro.", "This has made way for investment totaling 109 million in the game changers aimed at building the Groupe’s future growth (120 basis points) and increase in incentives payments for 70 basis points.", "The operating margins by region were 16.3% for Europe, 17.3% for North America, 17.9% for Asia Pacific, 15.0% for Latin America and 9.6% for the Middle East & Africa.", "Amortization of intangibles arising from acquisitions totaled 69 million euro in 2018, down from 73 million euro in 2017.", "The 114 million euro real estate transformation expense was as a result of the Groupe’s All in One real estate program commenced in early 2018.", "An impairment charge of 17 million euro was booked for the period.

Female CEOs earned slightly less, by about 9% on a median basis, although the small number of data points makes drawing conclusions difficult.", "Below, we lay out some of the top findings from our analysis. Our methodology is detailed in full at the bottom of this report.", "Rankings are listed first for the overall group of 194 companies, and then are segmented by company size: large pharma, biotechs worth more than $10 billion, between $2 billion and $10 billion, and between $500 million and $2 billion.", "Compensation includes base salary, cash bonuses and long-term stock and option awards, as described in annual proxy filings.", "| Company | CEO | Compensation, in $USD millions |", "| Company | CEO | Compensation, in $USD millions |", "| Company | CEO | Compensation, in $USD millions |", "| Company | CEO | Compensation, in $USD millions |", "| Company | CEO | Compensation, in $USD millions |", "| Company | CEO | Compensation, in $USD millions |", "| Company | CEO | Compensation, in $USD millions |", "CEOs in biotech and pharma earn sizable annual salaries, but it's stock and option grants that compose the bulk of total compensation.", "Like many corporations around the world, biotech and pharma chiefs typically also receive cash bonuses linked to their yearly performance — as defined by the company.", "Paying CEOs mostly via equity awards, the thinking goes, keeps the incentives of company executives in line with those of shareholders.", "Critics, though, argue the practice can spur short-term thinking, leading company chiefs to chase quarterly earnings numbers rather than long-term growth.", "Equity awards can vary greatly year to year. Sarepta Therapeutics' Douglas Ingram, for example, earned roughly $55 million more in 2017 than in 2018, thanks to $44 million in option grants that year.", "Compensation for MeiraGTx's Alexandria Forbes, meanwhile, swung from just over $1 million in 2017 to nearly $23 million last year.", "Valuing equity-based compensation is another question. For the purposes of regulatory reporting, companies determine an effective fair value for stock and option grants given to CEOs.", "That can differ — quite significantly — from what executives actually earn when they go to sell shares or exercise options, a sum generally referred to as annual realized gains.", "Regeneron's Leonard Schliefer, for example, was paid $26.5 million last year. But he also exercised options worth nearly $113 million.", "Like most other industries, biotech and pharma leadership skews heavily male. In 2018, more than 90% of CEOs were men.", "Just 16 of the 194 executives included in this analysis were female.", "Gender representation is even more lopsided among the largest companies. Across the 25 biggest pharma and biotech companies by value, GlaxoSmithKline's Emma Walmsley was the only woman.", "Compensation appeared broadly similar by median pay, although such comparison is hindered by a fewer number of data points for female CEO pay.", "Among the 15 female CEOs for whom numbers were available, the median woman made $5.2 million versus the $5.7 million earned by the median male, a difference of about 9%.", "It's worth noting, though, that Walmsley's pay of $7.8 million last year ranked 9th among the 14 pharma executives included in BioPharma Dive's analysis, and below the median sum for both the U.K. cross-industry and global pharmaceutical groups used by GSK as comparators.", "Most drugmakers reported CEO pay. Compensation for a handful of executives whose companies are listed abroad was not readily available.", "Among the 182 companies that did report, the median compensation was about $5.7 million. Averaged, that figure rose to just over $7.6 million.", "Fewer companies, 112, reported median employee pay. Using that dataset, the median figure for the group was $177,560, a rough estimate of what a typical worker in the biotech and pharma industry might make.", "Median pay numbers ranged from $38,661 to $804,000.", "Using those median figures for the group yields a CEO-to-employee pay ratio of roughly 32:1.", "The provision under the Dodd-Frank Act compelling companies to disclose median employee compensation and CEO pay ratios took effect for fiscal years beginning on or after Jan. 1, 2017, making 2018 the second year for which this data is available.", "While that doesn't provide much context, two data points allow for some comparison of change over time.", "BioPharma Dive found median CEO compensation — including equity awards — grew significantly faster than that of a median employee at small and medium-sized biotech companies.", "At large biotechs, median CEO and employee pay grew at roughly similar rates. In absolute terms, however, the typical executive earned more than $800,000 more in 2018 than in 2017, versus a boost of about $9,000 for the typical worker.", "The typical biopharma company saw its stock fall about 8% last year, but faltering market performance did not appear associated with lower executive compensation.", "Median pay for CEOs of companies which ended 2018 in the red, in fact, grew slightly more than for those who led drugmakers with positive stock returns last year.", "Among the 69 drugmaker stocks which grew in value year over year, the median executive compensation increased by 23%, versus the 27% bump to median pay among the 105 companies which posted declining share values.", "For what it's worth, employee pay moved in similar directions to stock performance: median compensation among companies in the green increased 6.1% while declining 4.6% for those in the red.", "Scrutiny of executive pay is commonplace regardless of sector, but in the drug industry it comes amid criticism over pharmaceutical pricing.", "Do pharma and biotech CEOs make more if they hike prices? It was a question asked by Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., at a hearing held by the powerful Senate Finance Committee in February, when top executives from seven drugmakers were called to testify on drug costs.", "Wyden's question was directed at Richard Gonzalez, the CEO of AbbVie, which makes the world's top-selling drug, Humira.", "AbbVie uses Humira sales as one factor in deciding the annual cash bonus for its top executives, which for Gonzalez totaled nearly $4 million last year.", "AbbVie's bonus framework is notable. Among the top 25 companies by value in BioPharma Dive's analysis with marketed products in the U.S., only six included sales of an individual product in their annual bonus calculations.", "Wyden's question also raises a wider one for the industry. Revenue targets are typically used in calculating executive compensation like cash bonuses.", "For many biotechs, though, revenue can be roughly that of one product's sales. AbbVie, for instance, derives three-fifths of its revenue from Humira, while the five others that included individual product sales targets in bonus calculations depended greatly on their respective top-sellers.", "Raising prices is a potent lever for boosting sales, so tying bonuses to revenue targets could in theory link compensation to prices for those companies with only one or few marketed products.", "In the case of Humira, AbbVie raised the drug’s list price by 9.7% in 2018 and by 6.2% in 2019 — increases that, while diminished by rebates and discounts, helped sales.", "In a written response to Wyden's question, AbbVie said no one factor determined more than 3% of Gonzalez's total compensation, of which his annual bonus made up 18%.", "Others are more explicit. Vertex earns much of its revenue from its three marketed cystic fibrosis drugs and includes a target for combined revenues in its annual bonus calculation.", "According to the company, though, such goals \"were not set, achieved through or dependent upon, price increases.\"", "BioPharma Dive merged and de-duplicated lists of holdings included in two biotech stock indices, the SPDR S&P Biotech ETF and iShares NASDAQ Biotechnology Index, to create a group of 238 biotech companies.", "We then added in biotech companies which had IPO'd in 2018 and are not yet included in either index (e.g. Moderna) to get a list of 265.", "Pharmaceutical companies, including those headquartered abroad, were included in a separate list of 14.", "Biotech companies with market capitalizations below $500 million as of May 20 were excluded from this analysis, reducing the biotech group to 180 companies.", "We did so to ensure we had a data set with companies in which median employee compensation would be based on a sufficient number of employees, and to create a more manageable data set.", "Smaller companies are also more likely to claim an exemption from reporting median employee compensation and CEO pay ratios.", "Market capitalizations were calculated using the Google Finance function or, when necessary, by multiplying the last disclosed number of outstanding common shares by closing prices on May 20.", "Employee compensation numbers and CEO pay ratios were not reported by all companies. Many that did not claimed \"Emerging Growth Company\" status, a reporting exemption under the Dodd-Frank Act.", "Employee numbers were tabulated from the latest relevant regulatory disclosure available, usually a Form 10-K.", "In some cases, reported CEO pay ratios were rounded to the nearest whole number.", "For growth in median compensation, BioPharma Dive segmented companies into large, mid-sized and small biotechs, excluding those lacking matched data (e.g. no 2017 numbers reported).", "We then calculated the median figures of each matched group for CEO and employee compensation, measuring percent and absolute change from 2017 to 2018.", "A public version of the database BioPharma Dive created can be found at this link.", "Large cap biotech: Market capitalization greater than $10 billion", "Mid-sized biotech: Market capitalization between $2 billion and $10 billion", "Small biotech: Market capitalization between $500 million and $2 billion", "CEO total compensation: The total figure reported on Summary Compensation Table in proxy or other filings.", "Inclusive of base salary, annual cash bonus, equity and option grants as well as miscellaneous payments within the 2018 calendar year.", "Median employee compensation: Employee compensation reported in the Dodd Frank Act-mandated CEO pay ratio section of company proxy filings.", "Inclusive of salary, 401(k) contributions and healthcare benefits.", "CEO pay ratio: A ratio of CEO total compensation to median employee compensation.

essence, this framework ensures the quality, safety, and efficacy of medicines placed on the market in the EU.", "The regulatory framework is established principally in Directive 2001/83/EC, and a number of other Directives and Regulations (e.g., on clinical trials, manufacturing, orphan medicinal products, pediatric research, and ATMPs) establish its principles (Table S1).", "To quote the European Commission (EC) from their website, “the EU legal framework for human medicines sets standards to ensure a high level of public health protection and the quality, safety and efficacy of authorised medicines.", "In addition, it promotes the functioning of the internal market, with measures to encourage innovation.", "It is based on the principle that a medicinal product requires a Marketing Authorisation by the competent authorities before being placed on the market.”", "The Marketing Authorisation Application (MAA) procedure, therefore, ensures the quality, safety, and efficacy of all medicinal products for human use, by requiring regulatory review of quality, safety, and efficacy data generated during clinical development prior to Marketing Authorisation (i.e., commercial licensing).", "In turn, the clinical development activities and product manufacturing must comply with the particular standards and requirements within the legislation and the principles of good clinical practice and Good Manufacturing Practice to ensure that the data presented in the MAA are complete, accurate, and satisfactory.", "The medicinal product regulatory framework established by the EC is implemented by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) together with the national regulatory agencies in the EU member states.", "A key focus of the EMA in recent years, as well as regulatory agencies in the United States and Japan, has been to develop and implement schemes to expedite clinical development and enable new medicines to reach the market, and patients, as early as possible.", "In the EU, the EMA introduced the priority medicines (PRIME) scheme in 2016 for this particular purpose.", "PRIME uses tools already existing in the EU regulatory framework—such as scientific advice, conditional approval, and accelerated assessment—to define and optimize the development pathway for priority medicines addressing high unmet medical need and/or demonstrating therapeutic innovation (discussed subsequently).", "Scientific advice is formal dialogue with the EMA in which feedback on, and endorsement of, development programs can be obtained to ensure that the appropriate data needed for the MAA are generated.", "Conditional approval and accelerated assessment are regulatory procedures that can be used within a regulatory strategy, which can enable an MAA to be submitted, reviewed, and approved as early and as quickly as possible, helping to ensure timely provision of novel medicines to patients.", "How the EU regulatory framework applies to ATMPs in general (Figure 1), and is leveraged for ATMPs designated as priority medicines, is discussed further in this review.", "A key aspect of medicinal product legislation is that it defines what a medicinal product is. Directive 2001/83/EC defines a medicinal product as (1) any substance or combination of substances presented as having properties for treating or preventing disease in human beings; or (2) any substance or combination of substances that may be used in or administered to human beings, either with a view to restoring, correcting, or modifying physiological functions by exerting a pharmacological, immunological, or metabolic action or to making a medical diagnosis.", "The 1990s witnessed a breakthrough in the development of experimental therapies based on human genes and/or cells within university hospital environments; for example, gene-based therapies for severe combined immunodeficiencies (adenosine deaminase", "[ADA]-SCID and X-linked [X]-SCID) and hemophilia and cell-based therapies for cornea and cartilage repair.", "Recognizing the fact that these pioneering investigational therapies met the criteria for medicinal products, and, therefore, to ensure that their clinical use was conducted with quality, safety, and efficacy in mind, the EC introduced cell- and gene-based therapies into European medicinal product legislation via Directive 2003/63/EC, amending Directive 2001/83/EC, in June 2003 as a new category of biological medicinal products, termed ATMPs.", "Next, in late 2008, Directive 2001/83/EC and Regulation (EC) No. 726/2004 (on procedures for human medicinal product authorisation and supervision within the EU and EEA) were amended by a specific Regulation on ATMPs: Regulation (EC) No. 1394/2007.", "This regulation (which is known as the ATMP regulation) defines ATMPs as three specific types of medicinal products, including gene therapy medicinal products (GTMPs), somatic cell therapy medicinal products (SCTMPs), and tissue-engineered products (TEPs), all of which meet one of the definitions of medicinal products described above.", "In addition, combined ATMPs are those that contain a medical device, as an integral part of a viable cell- or tissue-containing product, or that contain non-viable cells or tissues, which are liable to act upon the body with action that can be considered primary to the device element.", "The ATMP regulation entered into force to ensure that products defined as ATMPs are subject to appropriate regulatory evaluation, according to the regulatory framework for human medicinal products, prior to clinical and commercial use in a consistent way across the European community.", "Central to this was the formation of an expert committee within the EMA, the Committee for Advanced Therapies (CAT), to perform the primary evaluation of ATMP MAAs, contribute to other ATMP-specific activities of the EMA, and follow scientific developments in the field.", "The introduction of the ATMP regulatory framework has now led to the growth of an industry around cell and gene therapy development, with many clinical trials now taking place worldwide.1, 2, 3 The number of ATMPs with a current Marketing Authorisation (MA) as of early 2019 is nine (Table 1; including products for SCID, cartilage disease, and corneal disease that evolved from the pioneering experimental medicines of the 1990s), while four previously authorised ATMPs are no longer available for various reasons.", "The number of authorised ATMPs is expected to increase significantly over the next few years, particularly given that cell and gene therapy development is also blossoming in other global territories, and, importantly, in the other ICH (International Council for Harmonization of Technical Requirements for Registration of Pharmaceuticals for Human Use, previously the International Conference on Harmonization) regions (see later) of the US and Japan (Table 1).", "Indeed, three ATMPs are currently in MAA procedures (Table 1), and they can reasonably be expected to be granted MAs in the coming months.", "| Product | Class | Disease Area | Year | Company

Procedure, Directive 2009/120/EC, and the ATMP Classification Procedure", "The introduction of the ATMP regulation required ATMPs to be evaluated under the centralised procedure described in Regulation (EC) No. 726/2004, with the evaluation being performed primarily by the CAT.", "The centralised procedure requires that MAAs for certain medicinal products are evaluated by the appropriate EMA committee rather than by a national regulatory agency as part of a mutual recognition or decentralised procedure, thus making a product available throughout the EEA on the basis of a single MA granted to the MA holder (MAH), the legal entity with responsibility for placing and maintaining the ATMP on the market.", "According to the EMA, most new active substances marketed in the EU now go through the centralised procedure, but it is mandatory for ATMPs, medicines derived from biotechnology processes, orphan medicinal products (see later), and medicines for the treatments of certain diseases such as cancer and HIV.", "This is because the evaluation of these products is considered to require broad and diverse scientific expertise from across the European community.", "In addition, the scientific and technical requirements needed to demonstrate the quality, safety, and efficacy of ATMPs in MAAs being evaluated via the centralised procedure are specific to this class of medicines in many respects, and this was addressed through the introduction of Directive 2009/120/EC in late 2009 to replace Part IV of Annex I to Directive 2001/83/EC.", "In recognition of the unique challenges associated with the clinical development of ATMPs, Directive 2009/120/EC further introduced the risk-based approach (RBA) for these products, providing the scope to justify, on specific aspects of the product and patient population, the type and extent of quality, safety, and efficacy data included in the MAA.", "Together with the medicines directive and the ATMP regulation, the centralised procedure (as set out in Regulation [EC] No. 726/2004), with primary evaluation performed by the CAT according to the technical requirements of Directive 2009/120/EC, is key to the ATMP regulatory framework.", "Directive 2009/120/EC additionally provides updated definitions of ATMPs relative to the ATMP regulation (Table S2).", "According to Directive 2009/120/EC, GTMPs comprise a category of ATMPs containing an active substance, which contains or consists of a recombinant nucleic acid and whose mechanism of action involves regulating, repairing, replacing, adding, or deleting a genetic sequence that mediates a therapeutic, diagnostic, or prophylactic effect either directly or indirectly through a protein it expresses (not including vaccines against infectious diseases).", "They are manufactured through processes that involve the generation of genetic constructs and the amplification of these constructs (often as viral vectors) in cell lines, following which they are either purified for direct administration (non-cell-based, or in vivo, gene therapies) or used for the transduction of therapeutic cells (cell-based, or ex vivo, gene therapies).", "Products containing cells or tissues that are not genetically modified are defined as ATMPs (either SCTMPs or TEPs) if they are manufactured using a process that involves substantial manipulation of the starting materials (cells or tissues), which differentiates them from cells or tissues used in medical procedures that undergo processing via minimal manipulation (and are, therefore, not considered starting materials for product manufacture).", "Minimal manipulation may simply involve cell purification (without culture) and/or washing before infusion into a patient (hematopoietic stem cell transplantation being the classic example), and so any processing that is inherent to the modification of their biological characteristics, physiological functions, or structural properties would be considered substantial manipulation (e.g., in vitro cell culture).", "Importantly, cell-based therapies are also considered to work through a pharmaceutical, immunological, or metabolic mode of action, consistent with the definitions of medicinal products.", "Tissue-engineered products are further defined (in the ATMP regulation) as products that contain or consist of engineered cells or tissues and act through the repair, replacement, or regeneration of damaged or diseased tissues and organs, and this is generally achieved in combination with a scaffold.", "Therefore, SCTMPs, GTMPs, and TEPs are regulated as medicinal products because their mode of action is typical of other medicinal products, their mode of action is mediated by a genetic sequence, and/or their production involves substantial manipulation and industrial manufacturing processes.", "The exception to this rule is when cells are only manipulated minimally but are used for a purpose not reflecting the same essential function of the cells in the recipient as in the donor; in this case, such non-homologous therapeutic use of cells means that they are regulated as a medicinal product, i.e., an ATMP.", "To determine whether a therapeutic product based on human cells or tissues meets the criteria that define ATMPs, developers can apply for an ATMP classification from the EMA, as established in article 17 of the ATMP regulation.", "After submission of the application, the EMA should deliver its recommendation after consultation with the EC and within 60 days of receiving the request.", "The ATMP classification procedure was established to address questions on borderline classifications, including whether products may be classified as combined ATMPs if they contain a medical device.", "In this respect, the ATMP classification procedure is helpful not only for determining whether a putative product is an ATMP or not (e.g., substantially manipulated versus minimally manipulated cells) and would, therefore, be subject to regulation under the medicinal product framework but also to determine what type of ATMP a product is (thus informing certain aspects of the development program, e.g., the specific dossier requirements and quality guidance to be followed4).", "This latter concept can be illustrated using two retroviral vector-transduced blood cell-based ATMPs that have successfully gone through the MAA procedure in the EU, MolMed’s Zalmoxis, a T cell-based product, and GlaxoSmithKline’s Strimvelis,5 a hematopoeitic stem cell (HSC) product (now owned by Orchard Therapeutics).", "In both products, the autologous cells are transduced with a retroviral vector before being transplanted into the patient.", "In Strimvelis, the genetic modification introduces a functional ADA gene into the HSC genome, leading to a gain of ADA enzyme function in ADA-SCID patients in which this enzyme is defective.", "Strimvelis is, therefore, a GTMP because the genetic modification contributes to the mechanism of action (gain of ADA function) in the transduced HSCs.", "In Zalmoxis, the retroviral vector encodes a truncated form of the human low-affinity nerve growth factor receptor (ΔLNGFR; which enables identification of transduced cells) and the herpes simplex I virus thymidine kinase (HSV-TK Mut2; a suicide gene).", "Zalmoxis is used as an adjunctive treatment to HSC transplantation to reconstitute the patient’s immune system; however, complications linked to its use (e.g., graft-versus-host disease [GvHD]) can occur in some patients.", "The genetic modification with the HSV-TK Mut2 suicide gene makes the cells in Zalmoxis susceptible to ganciclovir and valganciclovir, such that if a patient develops GvHD, ganciclovir or valganciclovir is given to kill the administered T cells, thereby treating the complication and preventing its further development.", "Therefore, the genetic modification in Zalmoxis does not contribute to the mechanism of action of its therapeutic indication, and the product is classified as an SCTMP.", "Note that therapies based on genes or cells may also be classified as biological medicinal products if they do not fulfill all of the criteria defining ATMPs.", "Many ATMPs in development in the EU are for rare diseases and conditions. If population analysis can demonstrate that a therapeutic indication for which any medicinal product is being developed is rare, as well as meeting certain other criteria, the medicinal product is likely to be eligible for orphan medicinal product (OMP) designation.", "The EMA’s orphan designation procedure was introduced in 2000 with the implementation of Regulation (EC) No. 141/2000 on orphan medicinal products (together with Regulation [EC] No. 847/2000", "[as amended], which sets out definitions and rules for implementation). The full set of criteria that a medicinal product must meet to qualify for EU orphan designation includes the following: (1) intention to treat, prevent, or diagnose a disease that is life threatening or chronically debilitating; (2) a prevalence of the condition in the EU of not more than 5 individuals in every 10,000 members of the population, or an unlikeliness that marketing of the medicine would generate sufficient returns to justify the investment needed for its development; and (3) no satisfactory method of diagnosis, prevention, or treatment of the condition concerned can be authorised, or, if such a method exists, the medicine must be of significant benefit to those affected by the condition.", "Further guidance is provided in the EC publications ENTR/6283/006 and 2016/C 424/03.7 According to Regulation (EU) No. 536/2014 on clinical trials, ultra-rare diseases are generally considered to be those that affect less than 1 in 50,000 members of the EU population.", "Ultra-rare disease designation is used more by health technology assessment (HTA) bodies for making reimbursement decisions rather than by the EMA for orphan medicinal product designation, which simply requires that rare disease status is confirmed (HTA bodies are regional or national organizations that provide recommendations or guidance on medicines and other health technologies that can be financed or reimbursed by the healthcare system in a particular member state or region on the basis of a value assessment).", "The concept of significant benefit is of key importance to orphan designation for medicines in development that target diseases with current treatment options.", "In simplistic terms, significant benefit means that a medicine produces a clinically relevant advantage or provides a major contribution to patient care, compared with existing treatments.", "Furthermore, significant benefit may mean that an orphan medicine is suitable for patients for whom current treatments do not work, it is likely to improve patient outcomes in combination with a current treatment, or it works as well as other treatments but is significantly easier or more convenient to use.", "Obtaining an orphan designation brings with it certain advantages aimed at incentivizing the development of new medicines for rare diseases.", "The very nature of rare diseases means that the development of medicines intended for small patient populations may have limited commercial value, because a return on the investment into the development of the medicine may not be obtained.", "Incentives provided to developers of EU orphan medicinal products include market exclusivity for the product in the protected indication for 10 years following the granting of the MA, and protocol assistance, a type of scientific advice tailored to orphan medicinal products that is charged at a reduced rate compared with standard scientific advice (some other procedural fees are also reduced).8", "Market exclusivity is protected by a requirement for applicants submitting an MAA to indicate in the application if any medicinal product has been designated as an orphan medicinal product for a condition relating to the proposed therapeutic indication.", "If it has and that orphan medicinal product is still under market exclusivity, the applicant is further required to submit a report on the similarity of the active substances, with significant differences being needed to demonstrate non-similarity and allow the competitor product to be authorised and marketed.", "In addition, even if two products are determined to be similar, an MA can still be granted for the second product in the protected indication if the second applicant can show that their product is safer, more effective, or otherwise clinically superior (or if the first MA holder gives their consent or is unable to supply sufficient quantities of their orphan medicinal product).", "Definitions of medicinal product similarity were initially established in EC Regulation No. 847/2000, but these definitions have recently been reviewed given the progress in medicinal product development, including the increase in ATMP development, in the intervening years.", "On May 29, 2018, EC Regulation (EU) 2018/781 was published to amend Regulation (EC) No. 847/2000 as regards the definition of the concept similar medicinal product.", "The definitions of non-similarity for ATMPs are presented in Table S4.", "The Development of Medicines for Pediatric Use Requires Special Considerations", "Traditional clinical trials, with products other than ATMPs, start with first time-in-human studies in which initial safety is generally tested in healthy adult volunteers (although oncology medicines, for example, would be used directly in patients), and later studies may enroll adults only.", "However, medicines developed in this way may also be suitable for diseases or conditions that affect children.", "In recognition of the fact that clinical protocols need to be tailored to pediatric patients rather than them being treated according to an adult trial protocol, the pediatric regulation (Regulation [EC] No. 1902/2006) was introduced in the EU in early 2007 with the aim of increasing the availability of medicines for children that have been demonstrated to have safety and efficacy in the pediatric population.", "The implementation of the pediatric regulation led to the creation of the pediatric investigation plan (PIP), which defines the clinical studies to be conducted in children, including details of the timing of studies relative to adult studies and the measures proposed to show medicinal product safety and efficacy in all subsets of the pediatric population.", "The PIP requirement is applicable to all new medicinal products for human use (and, in some situations, products that were authorised before the regulation became applicable), including ATMPs.", "However, deferrals can be granted when there is sufficient information to demonstrate safety and efficacy in adults and that development in children could delay the MAA submission, and waivers can be granted when development in children is not appropriate (e.g., if a disease or condition only affects the adult population, the product is likely to be ineffective or unsafe in the pediatric population, or the product does not represent a significant therapeutic benefit over existing treatments).", "The PIP application (including deferral and waiver requests) should be submitted before completion of the human pharmacokinetic studies (phase I or first time-in-human clinical trials), and it cannot be submitted after the initiation of the pivotal study or registration, i.e., the clinical trial performed to generate the main dataset to be used to support the MAA (except in duly justified circumstances).", "The EMA published a 10-year report in October 2017 containing an analysis of the data collected since the implementation of the pediatric regulation.9 The report describes an increase in medicines available for children over this period, particularly in rheumatology and infectious diseases but also in diseases that only affect children or where the disease shows biological differences between adults and children (e.g., rare diseases).", "It has been concluded that the implementation of the pediatric regulation has generally had a positive effect on medicine development for children (albeit that certain issues remain).", "As a result, the EMA together with the EC recently published a joint action plan to further support the development of pediatric medicines.10", "A number of incentives are available for developers of pediatric medicines, including an additional 2 years market exclusivity for orphan medicinal product indication (i.e., 12 years in total) or an additional 6 months duration of a supplementary protection certificate protecting the product and no fees for scientific advice and protocol assistance.", "Regulatory Agency Roles and Responsibilities in the Evaluation of ATMPs", "The requirement for ATMP MAAs to be evaluated according to the centralised procedure by the CAT emphasizes the role of the EMA not only in the evaluation of the MAA but also in scientific advice during the development phase, in addition to the other MA-enabling procedures that are the sole remit of the EMA (e.g., orphan medicinal product designations and PIPs).", "Approval of clinical trial authorisation (CTA) applications, however, occurs at a national level independently (usually, unless the voluntary harmonization procedure is followed) within each member state in which the CTA is submitted.", "Regulatory agencies in the EU member states are known as national competent authorities (NCAs), and while they have authority to approve MAAs in their own member state for medicines not subject to the centralised procedure (as part of a mutual recognition, decentralised, or national procedure), their main role during ATMP development, other than the evaluation of CTA applications, is scientific advice on clinical trial designs.", "EMA scientific advice can be obtained in addition to NCA scientific advice during clinical development to ensure that the requirements for the MAA are being met and that the appropriate regulatory pathways are being followed.", "EMA also offers parallel scientific advice together with the European Network for Health Technology Assessment (EUnetHTA), allowing medicine developers to obtain feedback from regulators and HTA bodies on their evidence generation plans, to support decision-making on MA and reimbursement of new medicines at the same time.", "The EMA itself is organized

It should be noted that none of the ICH guidelines are specific to cell and gene therapies but are generically applicable to the key elements of the product development process for all medicinal products.", "In the EU, specific guidelines have been developed by the EC on GCP in the context of clinical trials conducted with ATMPs.", "These guidelines make recommendations to sponsors, manufacturers, and clinical sites on critical aspects relevant to ATMPs, including, among others, the legal obligations toward donors, procurement of starting materials from tissue and blood establishments, animal facility management for xenogenic cell-based medicinal products, testing of the investigational medicinal product, and traceability of starting materials.", "These guidelines are compiled in chapter V (Additional Information) of EudraLex11 volume 10 according to Directive 2001/20/EC, and they are currently being revised for alignment with Regulation (EU) No. 536/2014 as part of a broader action plan on ATMPs implemented by the EC and EMA.12", "The key points being addressed in the new guidelines cover all of the main aspects of clinical trials, including design, application dossier, investigational medicinal product quality, administration procedure, traceability, sample retention, protection of clinical trial subjects, and safety reporting and monitoring.", "The intent of the EC is that the revised guidelines will further adapt GCP to ATMPs by focusing on ATMP specificities only, while the EU (established via Directive 2005/28/EC) and ICH guidelines will remain valid for the more generic aspects.", "Revision of the EC guidelines is in progress following the conclusion of an open consultation with stakeholders,13 and the finalized guidelines will likely be published in late 2019.", "Clinical trials should be prospectively planned and appropriately controlled to ensure that GCP-compliant data that demonstrate the safety and efficacy of an investigational medicinal product can be generated in support of an MAA.", "However, before the ATMP regulation came into force, some cell-based therapies were already being used on a named-patient basis in hospital environments.", "One such therapy developed by Professors Michele De Luca and Graziella Pellegrini of Holostem in Italy, comprising autologous tissue grafts grown from limbal epithelial stem cells to repair corneal damage caused by chemical burns, was successfully used in a few hundred patients between 1998 and 2007.14, 15 Treatment of these patients was performed under the appropriate human tissues for therapeutic use regulations.", "However, with the introduction of the ATMP regulation, the Italian medicines agency (Agenzia Italiana del Farmaco [AIFA]) stipulated that the therapy should be licensed as an ATMP for continued use beyond December 2012.", "As a result, the therapy was commercially developed by Holostem and Chiesi Farmaceutici S.p.A. as an ATMP now known as Holoclar,16, 17 and it received a conditional MA in 2015.", "To support the Holoclar MAA, Chiesi Farmaceutici S.p.A. used retrospective data from the named-patient treatments rather than performing prospective clinical trials in newly enrolled patients.16 Evidence from 119 treatments (106 patients) was provided from a long-term efficacy and safety study and from 29 patients who received a single treatment in an observational study aimed at assessing long-term safety of the product.", "Both studies were non-randomized, non-controlled, multicenter trials performed as retrospective independent analyses of ocular photographs to provide an objective assessment of clinical efficacy.", "The primary endpoint was a composite endpoint of the rate of patients with a successful transplantation at 12 months post-intervention, based on the co-presence of clinical signs.", "As discussed later, the conditions of the MA required the MAH to perform additional studies to confirm safety and efficacy post-authorisation, but the route to market for Holoclar is remarkable in that authorisation based on retrospective clinical data is unprecedented, and this is testament to the therapeutic effect of the product and the quality of the named-patient treatment programs.", "A medicinal product used in a clinical trial prior to MA is referred to as an IMP to indicate its developmental, unauthorised status.", "Use of an unauthorised product outside of a clinical trial typically means that the data generated cannot be used to support an MAA (the aim of clinical trials is research, while the aim of unauthorised product use outside of a clinical trial is treatment).", "However, in some situations, patients who would benefit from an unauthorised medicine may not be able to enter clinical trials, for example, because enrollment has ended, the trial has been completed, or the patient does not meet all inclusion criteria.", "In such cases, for patients with life-threatening, long-lasting, or seriously debilitating diseases, the use of unauthorised medicines outside of clinical trials is possible either under a compassionate use scheme, which is provided for pursuant to article 5 of Directive 2001/83/EC (as amended) and article 83 of Regulation (EC) No. 726/2004 (as amended), or on a named-patient basis (as set out in national legislation), including in some cases on a cohort (group) scheme basis (depending on the national legislation).", "Compassionate use is performed under regulatory agency oversight to enable patients who cannot enter clinical trials to benefit from treatment with products in development when suitable authorised therapies are not available.", "For products that are within the scope of articles 3(1) and 3(2) of Regulation (EC) No. 726/2004, article 83 clarifies that such products may be made available on a compassionate use basis to a group of patients.", "The EMA provides recommendations through the CHMP for such compassionate use of an unauthorised medicine, which must be undergoing clinical trials or have entered the MAA procedure, in patients meeting certain criteria.", "However, the actual compassionate use programs would be implemented on a member state basis according to procedures defined by the NCAs (where provided for in national law).", "The NCAs must inform the EMA that they have approved a compassionate use program for such a product. While early clinical studies will generally have been completed for a product approved for compassionate use, its full safety profile and dosage guidelines may not be fully established.", "Schemes similar to EU compassionate use are also operative in other global jurisdictions, including the United States and Japan (expanded access), Canada (special access programme), Australia (special access scheme), and Korea (treatment use of an investigational new drug).", "Treatment on a named-patient basis is also possible, through which medical practitioners obtain medicines directly from manufacturers, prior to authorisation, for an individual patient.", "This is done under the direct responsibility of the medical practitioner, is subject to the regulations implemented at a national level governing named-patient supply, and would not involve the EMA.", "EU member state national laws may also cover cohort program compassionate use and/or named-patient supply for products that would not fall within the scope of the centralised procedure.", "At the end of a successful clinical development program through which product safety and efficacy in a subset of the target patient population are demonstrated, provision of the ATMP to the wider patient population via commercialization on the EU pharmaceutical market requires a central MA to be obtained under the centralised procedure through submission of an MAA to the EMA.", "MAAs for ATMPs must be submitted to the EMA for evaluation under the centralised procedure, which results in one MA with one product name that is valid in all member states as well as in the EEA countries of Iceland, Liechtenstein, and Norway, and is based on one scientific opinion issued by the CHMP rather than individual member state opinions.", "Submission of an MAA must be carefully planned and managed by both the applicant and the EMA. The applicant is responsible for preparing the MAA in accordance with regulatory, scientific, and procedural guidelines, while the EMA must review the submission according to all applicable aspects of the legal framework.", "The submission is made in electronic common technical document (eCTD) format, which presents the quality, safety, and efficacy data, together with administrative content, as a dossier for regulatory review.", "Guidance to applicants is provided in EC EudraLex Notice to Applicants Volume 2B.18 Prior to submission of the MAA, the applicant is obliged to submit an eligibility request for review under the centralised procedure and, subsequently, a notification of the intention to apply 7 months prior to submission (submissions should be made according to a timetable published by the EMA).", "Upon acceptance of the submission, the EMA will appoint a rapporteur and a co-rapporteur to conduct the scientific evaluation of the dossier.", "A rapporteur is a member of an EMA committee or working party who leads the evaluation of an application by a team that they appoint.", "For ATMPs, the rapporteur and co-rapporteur are appointed from the CAT, whereas they would be appointed from the CHMP for other human medicinal products.", "A PRAC rapporteur is also appointed to evaluate the RMP, while a PRAC co-rapporteur is appointed to support the CAT rapporteur.", "Following their appointments, the (co-)rapporteurs hold a pre-submission meeting with the applicant to discuss the regulatory aspects of the upcoming application and to clarify any application-specific issues, following which the MAA can be submitted.", "Within the EMA, the CAT is responsible for reviewing the data on quality, safety, and efficacy of an ATMP submitted in the MAA, and this is the role of the rapporteur, co-rapporteur, and their teams.", "However, the CAT itself does not grant an MA for an ATMP but rather makes a recommendation to the CHMP, which may then issue a positive opinion to the EC, which, provided that it accepts the positive opinion, would then issue the MA.", "Because the CAT and CHMP comprise members representing all NCAs, the centralised procedure involves all EU member states in the decision-making process.", "The aim of the centralised procedure is to enable rapid, EU-wide authorisation of medicinal products, including ATMPs.", "The procedure itself involves a number of discrete steps that follow a specific timetable to achieve a CHMP opinion in 210 procedural days (not including clock-stops), followed by an EC decision within 67 days in the event that the CHMP issues a positive opinion at day 210.", "An idealized MAA procedure should, therefore, take 277 procedural days from submission to EC decision (Figure 3A; note that the accelerated assessment procedure shown in Figure 3B is discussed subsequently).", "Based on experience during the first decade of the ATMP regulation, the EMA has recently published procedural advice (Table S3) on how the evaluation of ATMPs should be executed to ensure efficiency and full collaboration among the CAT, CHMP, PRAC, working parties, and scientific advisory groups, thus enabling timely opinions.", "The procedure starts on day 0 with the electronic submission of the MAA package, and, upon successful validation to confirm that all requisite modules are included and complete (note that validation generally takes a few weeks), day 1 is declared to indicate that the procedure is underway.", "Between day 1 and day 120, the rapporteur and co-rapporteur lead the review of the dossier by their teams.", "At day 80, the rapporteur and co-rapporteur independently submit an initial assessment report (AR) to the CHMP and the CAT, which is also sent to the applicant.", "The day 80 ARs comprise a discussion on how the quality, safety, and efficacy of the product have been evaluated; a provisional recommendation on whether or not the product may be authorised (based on a positive or negative benefit-risk balance); and a draft list of questions on outstanding issues to be solved for a positive opinion to be granted.", "Upon receipt of the day 80 ARs, together with the PRAC rapporteur’s RMP AR, which follows on day 94, the CHMP agrees on the provisional recommendation and the outstanding issues to be solved, and it prepares the consolidated list of questions (LoQ) to be provided to the applicant, together with the rapporteur and co-rapporteur assessments, on day 120.", "A clock-stop is then implemented to give the applicant a period of time to respond to the outstanding issues by preparing answers to the LoQ.", "The provisional recommendation on whether the product under review may be authorised depends on the type of questions asked at day 120, and these will be classified as either major objections or other concerns.", "If major objections on quality, safety, or efficacy are raised, the provisional recommendation will be that the medicine cannot be authorised unless the major objections can be resolved within the time frame of the MAA procedure.", "Other concerns, in the absence of major objections, will allow a provisional recommendation on authorisation to be supported, but they still require resolution within the time frame of the procedure.", "The typical time frame for answering day 120 questions is 90 days, but this may be extended, typically by another 90 days, with appropriate justification.", "Submission of answers to the LoQ triggers the procedure to restart on day 121. Between days 121 and 180, the answers are reviewed by the rapporteur and co-rapporteur teams, and their suitability for addressing the major objections and/or other concerns is evaluated.", "At day 150, the rapporteur and co-rapporteur provide a joint AR (the day 150 JAR) to the CHMP for endorsement, which is also provided to the applicant prior to the CHMP-endorsed list of outstanding issues (LoOI) being communicated on day 180.", "Unless all outstanding issues (i.e., major objections and other concerns raised at day 120) are considered solved on day 180, at which point a CHMP opinion can be given, another clock-stop is then implemented for the applicant to respond to the outstanding issues, typically within 30 days prior to the CHMP opinion being given on day 210.", "In the event that a CHMP positive opinion is issued on day 180 or day 210, it is sent to the EC for issuance of an MA within 67 days.", "If a negative opinion is issued, this can be appealed by the applicant, obligating the CAT to review the validity of the initial opinion using only the data submitted in the original MAA, i.e., the applicant cannot submit new data for review (uniQure’s Glybera was authorised following review of an initial negative opinion19).", "Regardless of the type of opinion issued, the EMA publishes the outcomes of all MAA reviews in a number of ways on its website as part of its commitment to transparency.", "All opinions are published as press releases and in the CAT and CHMP monthly reports. In addition, for those medicines that receive an MA from the EC following endorsement of the CHMP positive opinion, a European public AR (EPAR) is published on the EMA website.", "An EPAR is a multi-part publication that includes a summary of how the positive opinion was reached, a detailed report on the assessment process that includes non-commercially sensitive information taken from the (co-)rapporteur ARs, details of post-authorisation procedures completed (e.g., variations), and product-specific information such as the summary of product characteristics (SmPC; a legal document that provides information for healthcare professionals on how to use the medicine and that is updated during the product life cycle; it is developed from the equivalent clinical-stage investigator’s brochure document included in a CTA submission), package leaflet (the package insert provided with a medicine to inform patients on how to use it), and product label(s).", "For MAAs that are refused, a refusal EPAR, including a question and answer document and an AR, is published.", "EPARs therefore represent a highly valuable source of information for developers of a prospective new medicine that are published based on the EMA’s commitment to transparency.20 MAHs must ensure that the product is compliant with the terms of its MA.", "Pursuant to Regulation (EC) No. 1049/2001, the EMA also commits to transparency beyond this minimal legal requirement, and it is possible for anyone to submit a request for further, non-commercially sensitive information not published on the EMA website (and not protected by any of the other exemptions from disclosure set out in the above regulation).", "The early years of cell and gene therapy saw some products being developed in university hospital environments as experimental medicines for the benefit of patients with no other treatment options and without commercial gain for the university or hospital.", "Although a global industry around cell and gene therapies is now developing, in which biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies are key players, the non-commercial supply of such therapies to individual patients may still take place in certain circumstances.", "Provision is made under the ATMP regulation for ATMPs not intended for commercial development to be supplied to patients without requiring an MA to be granted pursuant to Directive 2001/83/EC.", "This is made possible by the hospital exemption scheme, which exempts ATMPs from the centralised procedure if they are for use in a hospital within an individual member state on a non-routine basis, under the exclusive responsibility of a medical practitioner, and they comply with an individual medical prescription for a custom-made product for a named patient.", "The manufacturing of such products needs to be authorised by the NCA. The intention not to commercialize an ATMP, therefore, underlines the difference between supply under the hospital exemption scheme versus supply under compassionate use, and clinical data generated under the hospital exemption scheme cannot typically be used to support an MAA, because, unlike clinical trials, the scheme is not governed by the principles of GCP.", "In the current world of commercial cell and gene therapies, the hospital exemption scheme lives an uncomfortable existence because the potential continued use of non-commercial therapies under the scheme can threaten the profitability of MAHs who have made significant financial investment into commercial product development.", "Furthermore, the hospital exemption scheme has been implemented in different ways in different member states with respect to the definition of use of a product on a non-routine basis.", "The true value of the scheme may be interpreted as providing treatment options where none exist, for example, when a patient presents for urgent treatment but is unable to join a clinical trial or when compassionate use is not an option.", "From a medicinal product quality perspective, ATMPs used under the hospital exemption scheme should, according to the ATMP regulation, be of equivalent quality to ATMPs developed for commercialization.", "Again, quality requirements are implemented differently across member states, but in Italy, for example, product quality equivalent to that required for a phase II trial is expected.", "For complex ATMPs, e.g., gene-modified cells, the investment in CMC development4, 21 needed to demonstrate process robustness and product consistency is highly significant, and it should not be underestimated for hospital exemption use.", "The Type of MA Applied for Depends on the Target Patient Population and the Need for the Medicine", "Depending on the extent of clinical data obtained during development, an MA via the centralised procedure may be granted in three ways: standard MA, conditional MA, and MA under exceptional circumstances.", "In all cases, the MAA is reviewed according to the centralised procedure, and eligibility for the appropriate route to MA for any particular ATMP is determined by dialogue with the EMA during the development phase.", "A standard MA is awarded when specific obligations (see below) to further demonstrate the quality, safety, and efficacy—or the benefit-risk balance—of the medicinal product under evaluation are not required in addition to the data presented in the MAA to support the granting of the MA.", "In other words, a standard MA is awarded on the basis of a positive benefit-risk balance being supported by comprehensive clinical data at the time of the MAA.", "In accordance with article 14 (1–3) of Regulation (EC) No. 726/2004, a standard MA is initially valid for 5 years from the date of the EC decision, after which it may be renewed on application.", "Once renewed, the MA is valid for an unlimited period, unless the EMA decides, on justified grounds relating to pharmacovigilance (e.g., exposure of an insufficient number of patients to the medicinal product concerned), to mandate one additional 5-year renewal.", "A standard MA would typically be applied for when clinical data are not limiting, for example, because it is possible to perform clinical trials in sufficiently large numbers of patients and provide a statistically significant demonstration of safety and efficacy based on a therapeutically relevant endpoint, or when extensive clinical experience has been gained in the target patient population, including those for which an orphan medicinal product is being developed for a rare disease.", "A standard MA can still be subject to certain post-authorisation committments, usually in relation to safety (as discussed later).", "A conditional MA (CMA) may be applied for when an unmet medical need supports the availability of a medicine to patients prior to the comprehensive clinical data, normally required for an MA to be granted, being available.", "As such, medicines eligible for CMA typically include those aimed at treating, preventing, or diagnosing seriously debilitating or life-threatening diseases, and it may be possible to submit the CMA application upon completion of phase II studies to expedite the medicine’s availability (Figure 4).", "The CMA route is considered when comprehensive clinical data may not readily be obtained, e.g., when developing for a rare disease that by definition has a small target patient population, but when it is likely that the applicant will be in a position to provide comprehensive clinical data.", "Indeed, in most circumstances, orphan designation will qualify a medicinal product for the CMA route if significant benefit can be demonstrated over existing treatments or if unmet medical need is established because no suitable treatments already exist.", "However, the CMA route is not obligatory for orphan medicinal products if the applicant can justify that the clinical data available support a standard MA (of the orphan ATMPs that have been granted an MA to date [Tables 1 and 3], Strimvelis, Alofisel, Yescarta, and Kymriah received standard MAs while Holoclar and Zalmoxis received CMAs).", "| ATMP (MAH) | Class | Active Substance | Drug Product

Additional data were provided from one human pharmacokinetic study and four other efficacy and safety studies.", "However, the CAT and CHMP considered that it was not possible to conclude that an effect on overall survival following treatment with Imlygic was positive because of uncertainties in specific population subgroups, and, therefore, post-authorisation measures were required, including clinical study reports on the multicenter, phase II, single-arm trial performed in subjects with unresected, stage IIIB to IVM1c melanoma, which was ongoing at the time of evaluation.", "The MAH was also requested to perform additional post-authorisation clinical trials to generate further efficacy data and monitor the impact of Imlygic on disease progression, because specific validated biomarkers for the disease were unavailable.", "Other post-authorisation measures stipulated included the submission of an updated RMP as a result of risk management system modifications and whenever

therapies are in active development include the United States, Canada, Australia, Japan, and Korea.", "In the ICH regions of the United States and Japan, regulatory frameworks around cell and gene therapies have been further elaborated in recent years.", "In the United States, cell and gene therapies are recognized and regulated by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as a particular subset of biologic medicinal products known as cellular and gene therapy products, subjecting them to the biologics license application (BLA) procedure for commercialization (a BLA is the equivalent of an EU MAA) under Section 351 of the Public Health Service Act.", "Such cellular and gene therapy products are, therefore, regulated in a similar way to ATMPs, while human cells, tissues, or cellular or tissue-based products (HCT/Ps) are products containing or consisting of human cells or tissues that are intended for implantation, transplantation, infusion, or transfer into a human recipient.", "HCT/Ps are considered to be minimally manipulated products intended for homologous use only, and they are regulated under section 361 of the Public Health Service (PHS).", "With the introduction of the FDA’s 21st Century Cures Act, enacted on December 13, 2016, some cellular and gene therapy products may now also be granted a regenerative medicine advanced therapy (RMAT) designation.", "According to the 21st Century Cures Act, a drug is eligible for RMAT designation if the following apply: (1) the drug is a regenerative medicine therapy, which is defined as a cell therapy, therapeutic tissue engineering product, human cell and tissue product, or any combination product using such therapies or products, except for those regulated solely under section 361 of the Public Health Service Act and part 1271 of Title 21, Code of Federal Regulations; (2) the drug is intended to treat, modify, reverse, or cure a serious or life-threatening disease or condition; and (3) preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the drug has the potential to address unmet medical needs for such a disease or condition.", "The benefit of RMAT designation is that it qualifies the investigational drug for FDA support equivalent to that given to other drugs with fast track and breakthrough therapy designations (introduced through the FDA Modernization Act of 1997 and the FDA Safety and Innovation Act of 2012, respectively).", "These latter designations, breakthrough therapy in particular, are similar to the EMA’s PRIME designation, and, together with priority review designation and accelerated approval, they form part of the FDA’s expedited programs for serious conditions40 that can be applied to drugs targeting an unmet medical need.", "In the United States, drugs targeting an unmet medical need are defined as therapies against severe or life-threatening diseases with no current therapy option.", "If therapies are available, the medicinal product must demonstrate some advantage over available therapy to be eligible for any of the expedited programs described below.", "This is, therefore, similar to the requirement for orphan medicinal products in the EU to demonstrate an advantage (significant benefit) over available therapies to qualify for conditional approval.", "Fast track designation (FTD) can be requested at any time during development, but it is particularly applicable to therapies showing the potential based on pre-clinical or early clinical data to address an unmet medical need for a serious condition (as defined in FDA guidance).", "FTD provides the opportunity for more frequent meetings with the FDA to discuss the development plan and eligibility for priority review (a procedure similar to the EMA’s accelerated assessment that shortens the BLA period to a maximum of 6, rather than 10, months).", "FTD also allows access to rolling review, a procedure in which BLA dossier sections may be submitted separately for review upon completion, rather than waiting to submit the dossier in its entirety for contemporaneous evaluation.", "However, all dossier sections must still be made available for review within the BLA evaluation period, and the specific details of the rolling review must be agreed upon with the FDA up front.", "To qualify for breakthrough therapy designation (BTD), a drug should treat a serious condition, and preliminary clinical evidence should indicate that the drug may demonstrate substantial improvement on a clinically significant endpoint(s) over available therapies.", "BTD

BTD is potentially applicable to any drug intended to treat a serious condition, while RMAT designation is for regenerative medicine therapies (cellular and gene therapy products) intended to treat, modify, reverse, or cure a serious condition.", "Furthermore, while preliminary clinical evidence for BTD should indicate that the drug may demonstrate substantial improvement on a clinically significant endpoint(s) over available therapies, preliminary clinical evidence for RMATs should indicate that the drug has the potential to address unmet medical needs for a serious disease or condition (i.e., potentially in the absence of available therapies).", "RMAT designation gives access to all features of the BTD program, as well as to early interaction with the FDA for discussions on potential surrogate or intermediate endpoint inclusion in the trial design.", "It also provides support for potential accelerated approval and how post-approval requirements may be satisfied.", "Accelerated approval (not to be confused with the EMA’s accelerated assessment procedure) is similar in principle to the EMA’s CMA in that it is a procedure to allow drugs for serious conditions that fill an unmet medical need to be approved based on an intermediate or surrogate endpoint, with studies to confirm clinical benefit being completed post-approval.", "Draft guidance on how current guidance on the FDA’s expedited programs for serious conditions applies to RMATs was published in 2017,41 and cellular and gene therapy products with a current RMAT designation are shown in Table 4.", "Priority review is highly valued as a way of bringing new medicines to market quickly in the United States, because it enables revenues to be generated earlier than if the standard review timetable was followed.", "As a way of incentivizing the development of medicines for rare pediatric diseases, the FDA runs a voucher system through which medicine developers who successfully obtain a rare pediatric disease designation (RPDD) for their product may qualify for a voucher that can be redeemed for priority review of a subsequent marketing application for a different product.", "This is one way in which the FDA aims to offset the low return on investment associated with developing drugs for rare diseases, i.e., orphan medicinal products.", "Other FDA incentives for the development of orphan medicinal products include tax credits worth up to 50% of the development costs, a 7-year period of market exclusivity, and the waiving of marketing application review fees and annual FDA product fees.", "The value of priority review vouchers is shown in the fact that they are often traded between companies (legally) for hundreds of millions of dollars.", "One cellular and gene therapy product to obtain an RPDD is Spark Therapeutics’s Luxturna, an adeno-associated virus-based in vivo gene therapy that received a BLA in December 2017.", "Together with Kymriah (Novartis)42 and Yescarta (Kite, a Gilead Company), Luxturna is one of three gene therapies to receive a BLA in late 2017, with Kymriah being the first gene therapy to be approved by the FDA.", "The approvals of these three products are widely considered to represent the coming of age of the gene therapy industry, but this should not detract from the earlier EU authorisation of gene therapies, including Glybera and Strimvelis.", "A number of cell-based products are also authorised in the United States, including products such as Maci, Imlygic, and Provenge, that have also received an EU MA (Table 1).", "In Japan, medicinal products manufactured from human cells, genes, or tissues have been regulated under the Pharmaceuticals and Medical Devices Act (PMD Act) since November 2014, which was introduced to

notifications, and administrative notices (regulations).", "Under the PMD Act, medicinal products comprising human cells, genes, or tissues that will be marketed are now regulated generically as regenerative medical products (RMPs) by the Pharmaceuticals and Medical Devices Agency (PMDA), the agency responsible for evaluating medicinal products for use in clinical trials or for MA.", "RMPs are defined as processed human cells or gene therapy products that are intended to be used for the reconstruction, repair, or formation of structures or functions of the human body or for the treatment or prevention of human diseases.", "The PMD Act introduced a new pathway for the approval of RMPs that is distinct from the traditional pathway for small molecule drugs.", "Under the PMD Act, an RMP can obtain expedited CMA on the basis of safety and predicted probable efficacy demonstrated in early stage clinical trials.", "CMA of an RMP under the PMD Act is time limited and lasts for a maximum of 7 years, during which time the applicant is required to perform the later-stage trials that will be required for subsequent full MA.", "If these trials are not performed or if the data from them are considered inadequate to support full MA, the product must be withdrawn from the market at the end of the 7-year conditional authorisation period at the latest.", "To date, four RMPs have received an MA in Japan (Table 1). Jacc (an autologous cultured cartilage product) and Jace (an autologous cultured epidermis product) were initially authorised under the PAL prior to 2015, and Jace was re-authorised under the PMD Act as an RMP in 2016.", "Temcell, an allogeneic mesenchymal stem cell product for the treatment of acute GvHD, was the first RMP to be fully authorised under the PMD Act in September 2015.", "Temcell is essentially the same as Mesoblasts’s Prochymal, which was the first stem cell therapy to be granted an MA anywhere in the world when it was approved for the same indication by Health Canada in 2012.", "HeartSheet (an autologous skeletal myoblast preparation using cell sheet technology) was granted a 5-year conditional approval, also in September 2015, on the basis of data from a clinical study with no control arm, that used a surrogate endpoint, and included only a small patient number—conditions that precluded a full approval.", "The conditions applied for full approval of HeartSheet within 5 years include demonstration of efficacy in 60 patients and superiority to current existing treatment in 120 patients.", "HeartSheet remains the only RMP to have received conditional approval in Japan.", "The PMDA’s priority review system for innovative therapies targeting an unmet medical need is the sakigake designation, which was introduced in 2015.", "It is similar in principle to the EMA’s PRIME scheme and the FDA’s BTD in that its aim is to facilitate the rapid authorisation of new medicines; however, none of these schemes should be considered equivalent in how they are implemented by the respective regulatory agencies.", "In Japanese, “sakigake” means “pioneer.” To qualify for the sakigake designation, a medicinal product must be for a disease or condition with an urgent need of innovative therapy that is initially developed and submitted for authorisation in Japan and has high efficacy in early stage (phase I/II) clinical trials.", "To be considered an innovative therapy with an urgent need, the product should possess a new and different mechanism of action to currently authorised products and treat either a serious life-threatening disease or a chronic disease that leads to the deterioration of patient quality of life and for which there is currently no viable treatment.", "The benefits of sakigake designation include the following: (1) prioritized consultation (scientific advice) with PMDA, with the meeting taking place 1 month, rather than 2 months, after submission of the briefing documents; (2) scope for extensive consultation prior to submission of the marketing application, including a requirement to enter into consultation early in development once the designation is granted during phase I/II; (3) accelerated review of the marketing application, targeting review within 6 months rather than 12 months and enabling submission of phase III study data after submission of the marketing application; (4) assignment of a PMDA concierge to facilitate an efficient development program and marketing application process; and (5) implementation of specific post-authorisation safety measures, including extended follow-up (over 10 years) and global information dissemination.", "Sakigake designations are published annually by PMDA on their website, and sakigake designations have been published for two RMPs (AVXS-101 and NY-ESO-1 siTCRTM) in 2018.", "Of these, AVXS-101 (in development by Avexis) is a gene therapy product for the treatment of spinal muscular atrophy type 1 that has also received PRIME designation in the EU and BTD in the United States (Tables 2 and 4).", "NY-ESO-1 siTCRTM (in development by Takara Bio and Otsuka Pharmaceutical) is a gene-modified cell therapy product for the treatment of synovial sarcoma.", "NY-ESO-1-based products are also in accelerated development schemes in the EU and United States (Tables 2 and 4).", "A decade has now passed since the ATMP regulation came into force, requiring developers of cell- and gene-based therapies meeting the definitions of ATMPs to obtain an MA, according to the centralised procedure, to place their products on the EU pharmaceutical market.", "So far, 13 ATMPs have received an EU MA, and this rate of new product authorisation is widely considered to be low compared to the authorisation rates of other types of medicinal products.", "However, the number of authorised ATMPs is expected to increase further in 2019, with three other ATMPs are currently under MAA review (Table 1).", "This increased growth is being driven particularly by the coming of age of gene therapy development, with many such products now in clinical trials in addition to those already on the international markets, and also by the application of enhanced regulatory agency support to the development of ATMPs addressing unmet medical needs.", "In the EU, the EMA’s PRIME scheme is the main mechanism by which such support is provided, and it is interesting to note that over one-third of the medicines in the PRIME scheme are ATMPs and that all of these ATMPs are gene therapies.", "Regulatory agency support schemes also operate in the United States (breakthrough designation and RMAT designation) and Japan (sakigake designation), and these schemes are actively contributing to the progression of cell and gene therapies in these territories too.", "The PRIME scheme is a clear example of how the European regulatory landscape is being evolved by the EMA to facilitate the timely provision of innovative medicines to the broader patient populations (i.e., not just to those patients enrolled in clinical trials).", "Indeed, rather than being a static framework, the EU regulatory framework is constantly evolving for the benefit of patients and medicine developers.", "For cell and gene therapies, the EU ATMP regulation was the first move in this respect. This was elaborated further by the risk-based approach to development and description of the technical requirements expected of ATMPs being developed for commercialization laid down in Directive 2009/120/EC.", "Lessons from the experience with ATMP development since the introduction of the ATMP regulation are also being applied to the evolution of regulatory guidance and procedures.", "The CAT publishes a work plan annually on the activities it is addressing, with current notable examples being revision of the Guideline on Safety and Efficacy Follow-up and Risk Management of Advanced Therapy Medicinal Products and the development of specific guidance on the requirements for ATMPs in clinical trials.", "In late 2017, Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP) guidelines specific to ATMPs were published to adapt the GMP framework to novel aspects of these products, such as decentralised manufacture, final product reconstitution at the treatment center, and release of out-of-specification (autologous) products.", "The GMP for ATMPs guidelines are published as Part IV of EudraLex Volume 4 on Good Manufacturing Practice, and they are considered as stand-alone guidelines that should be used independently of, and not in conjunction with, GMP guidelines for other types of medicinal products.", "As discussed above, specific GCP guidelines for ATMPs are now also under revision.", "One particular development that will help facilitate clinical trials with investigational medicinal products that contain or consist of genetically modified organisms (GMOs) in particular will be the harmonization of GMO authorisations across the European community.", "GMOs are subject to both clinical trial and GMO legislation.

According to a report in the Journal of the American Medical Association, “From 1997 through 2016, medical marketing expanded substantially, and spending increased from $17.7 to $29.9 billion,24 with direct-to-consumer advertising for prescription drugs and health services accounting for the most rapid growth, and pharmaceutical marketing to health professionals accounting for most promotional spending.”", "The report also found that from 1997 through 2016, “the number of advertisements … increased from 79,000 (including 72,000 television commercials) in 1997 to 4.6 million (663,000 television25 commercials) in 2016.”", "Despite these taxpayer subsidies, prescription drug prices are nonetheless increasing at an alarming rate.", "In 2019, price increases from drug manufacturers affected more than 3,40026 drugs.

Drug patents last for 20 years after the filing date.", "Pharmaceutical companies have also employed tactics such as evergreening and thicketing to prolong a drug’s exclusivity.", "When evergreening, pharmaceutical companies make certain modifications to a drug such as changing its35 chemical composition slightly or making an external change as minor as adding a stripe to a pill36 in order to preserve their patents.", "A 2018 study in the Journal of Law and the Biosciences found that 78 percent37 of new drug patents awarded in the past decade went to drugs that already existed.", "Seventy percent 38 of the nearly 100 bestselling drugs extended their exclusivity protections at least once, and 50 percent extended their patents more than once.", "The second tactic—thicketing—involves flooding the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office and the courts with excessive patents and applications to make it difficult for competing firms to secure patents.", "These tactics help preserve pharmaceutical companies’ monopolies and ensure that drug prices remain uncompetitive and thus less affordable for everyday Americans.", "While consumers continue to pay the price of this market manipulation, a Government Accountability Office (GAO) report on the pharmaceutical industry found that these unfair practices are significantly enriching manufacturers.", "As the report stated, “Among the largest 25 companies, annual average profit margin fluctuated between 15 and 20 percent.”39", "The GAO contextualizes these profits by comparing the pharmaceutical industry’s profits with those of its counterparts, stating that “the annual average profit margin across non-drug companies among the largest 500 globally fluctuated between 4 and 9 percent.”", "In 2018 alone, the CEOs of major pharmaceutical companies Allergan, Johnson & Johnson, and Pfizer Inc. made a total of $90 million.40 Meanwhile, according to a CBS News report, Americans spent $535 billion41 on prescription

the Congressional Budget Office estimated that the measure would actually increase federal spending on Medicare and Medicaid by $177 billion.54 The Trump administration also announced a regulation that would require TV ads for drugs to include the list price.55 Some experts believe this policy will be ineffective56 at making pharmaceutical companies lower list prices or end price hikes for

Gilead’s UK patent on Truvada.", "In August 2018, the FDA approved the first generic drug version of Truvada after an abbreviated new drug application (ANDA) was filed by Amneal Pharmaceuticals.", "In all of this, it’s important to note that there are many considerations that have nothing to do with whether or not that medication is patent-protected that come into play when a pharmaceutical firm prices a medication.", "The potential size of a drug’s market and competition from other branded drugs treating the same disease are other factors that can inform pricing decisions, according to Patrick Gallagher, Partner at Duane Morris LLP and Chair of the firm’s Pharmaceuticals and Biopharmaceuticals Litigation and Regulatory group.", "Gallagher has represented both R&D firms and generic manufacturers in the pharmaceutical market. “If you have two products that are both branded that, for example, treat high blood pressure, they’re going to compete against each other in addition to any generic competition,” he said.", "Layered on top of those considerations are a myriad of complex interactions with the U.S. healthcare system, including insurers and the Medicare and Medicaid programs.", "According to Gallagher, price erosion starts to heavily affect branded pharmaceuticals once there are two or three generics available on the market, which can cause prices to drop by 90 to 95 percent in some cases as the drug essentially falls to commodity prices.", "But the introduction of a generic doesn’t necessarily mean that a manufacturer will cut its prices for the branded drug.", "“Sometimes a brand company will actually raise prices in response to a generic if they believe that there’s some degree of loyalists that are insensitive to price and want to stick with the brand,” he said.", "However, for small molecule products, as soon as a generic product comes onto the market, automatic substitution laws essentially require pharmacists to substitute generic equivalents for the branded drug where those generics are available.", "“One of the main benefits of generic drugs is access to lower-cost life-saving and health-serving medications,” Gallagher said.", "On the other hand, patent protection is vital to the firms who are actually pursuing the R&D necessary to cure new diseases.", "“The incentive to companies large and small that continue to invest or attract venture capital and angel investment comes in large part from the ability to have appropriate patent protection,” he said.", "“Otherwise, as soon as the product comes out on the market, it could be reverse-engineered by companies looking to compete.”", "This would have a drastic effect on innovation, he said. “You wouldn’t continue to have such robust R&D programs bringing about new therapies to cure cancer or new antibiotics.", "The balance between access and innovation is easy to talk about, but in practice it becomes really difficult to get perfect.”", "But patents aren’t the only reason why generic equivalents to certain branded pharmaceuticals don’t exist.", "“Another major factor that impacts a lack of competition for drug products, which then leads to higher prices, is the cost of regulatory approval as a barrier to entry for any competing therapy, including generics,” Gallagher said.", "In recent statements, Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Commissioner Scott Gottlieb has acknowledged that regulatory hurdles, including the FDA’s own review process for generics, can delay their market entry.", "The FDA has even published a list of dozens of drugs that are off-patent, off-exclusivity but don’t have a generic equivalent on the market.", "A statement from FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb released on February 15 acknowledged that there are several hundred branded drugs with no patent protections or exclusivities and yet there’s no competitive generic available.", "While the list price of Truvada is what has been generating a lot of the discussion around ending patent protection for the drug, it’s also important to note that very few people, if anyone, actually end up paying that price out of pocket.", "According to sources at the Biotechnology Innovation Organization (BIO), many medications, including Truvada, are widely covered by insurance and not even insurers typically end up paying the list price.", "The list price is typically just the start of a negotiation phase that involves insurers, pharmacy benefits managers and other players.", "Then there are initiatives like the 340B Drug Pricing Program that require manufacturers to provide drugs to certain populations and organizations at a significantly reduced cost.", "Indeed, that $1,500 list price for Truvada shouldn’t be viewed like a retail tag at a department store indicating a product’s shelf price.", "Rather, it’s more akin to a car manufacturer’s suggested retail price, which usually ends up getting negotiated lower at the dealership.", "BIO also noted that many drug manufacturers offer rebates or other programs that reduce the price paid for a pharmaceutical, so that even the first buyer in the supply chain ends up paying much less than the list price.", "Some drug manufacturers offer rebates of 40% or more to buyers so that a drug listed at a price that sometimes approaches six figures often enters the supply chain at a much lower price.", "By the time that drug reaches a pharmacy, what a consumer ends up paying is a fraction of that.", "Tom Wilbur, a spokesman for the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America (PhRMA), provided the following statement on the importance of patents to the pharmaceutical industry:", "“The lifeblood of the biopharmaceutical industry lies in inventions—each medical innovation that leads to new or improved treatments and cures.", "It typically takes 10 to 15 years to develop a new medicine from the earliest stages of discovery through FDA approval and costs an average of $2.6 billion.", "The biopharmaceutical industry spends more on research and development than any other industry in the U.S. economy—investing an estimated $90 billion in 2016 alone.", "A strong U.S. patent system is vital in this process. It provides companies with certainty and time to engage in the lengthy and costly research process needed to develop safe and effective medicines.", "It also promotes competition and gives companies certainty that their invention is protected, while at the same time, the specifics of the invention are published so others can learn from it and use it as the foundation for future invention and discovery.", "Without strong patent protections, researchers may not have the ability to explore new areas of medical innovations, which ultimately hurts patients.”", "Calls upon the federal government to use their march-in rights under U.S. patent law in response to drug pricing concerns are nothing new.", "In recent years, the state of Louisiana proposed a similar solution to obtain generic competition for Gilead’s hepatitis C treatment, Sovaldi, which in 2016 had cost the state’s Medicaid program an average of $85,000 per year for each patient prescribed the drug.", "However, this January, Louisiana state officials announced that they had agreed to a subscription-based payment model to obtain unlimited access to Gilead’s hepatitis C treatment for the state’s Medicaid and prison populations.", "There’s also some question about whether the situation with Truvada as a PrEP treatment makes a strong case for the exercise of march-in rights because of the drug’s history.", "Gilead’s combination of emtricitabine and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate had previously been approved as a treatment for AIDS and had been prescribed as such for many years prior to FDA approval of the drug as a pre-exposure prophylactic.", "The testing that determined Truvada as being effective as a preventative measure against HIV infection was funded by the federal government, but Gilead’s development of the drug itself was for the purposes of treating AIDS.", "So, while #BreakThePatent’s website argues that taxpayers fronted almost all of the costs of the research that went into Truvada’s PrEP designation, and while some point out that Gilead’s role in that research was simply donating the medication, it’s not as if Gilead was actively working to corner the PrEP market.", "The PrEP version of Truvada is also a voluntary treatment and, while it is widely covered by insurance, in reality this debate might have more to do with difficult decisions about insurance coverage rather than anything to do with patents.", "Although the federally-funded research behind Truvada as a PrEP treatment doesn’t of itself give NIH the opportunity to exercise march-in rights on Truvada, the two Orange Book patents covering Truvada do acknowledge that federal funding went into the development of the invention and that the U.S. government has certain rights.", "However, march-in rights under Bayh-Dole require that the invention funded by the government isn’t available on “reasonable terms” before those march-in rights can be exercised.", "It’s important to note that a drug’s high price, while it may sway the court of public opinion, usually doesn’t qualify as an unreasonable term.", "In recent years, the NIH has refused to exercise march-in rights on high cost drugs when data showed that annual sales of the drug have increased, such as is the case with Truvada.", "March-in rights were written into the language of Bayh-Dole to prevent against situations where a federally-funded invention wasn’t being commercialized, and Truvada is absolutely being commercialized.", "While it’s not part of the crowd calling for the government to utilize march-in rights on Gilead’s Orange Book patents covering Truvada, the Initiative for Medicines, Access, and Knowledge (I-MAK) has been an important player internationally in opposing patents for the purposes of promoting public access to generic medicines.", "The group challenges what it believes are unmerited patents that act as a barrier on access and, while it has focused more on developing economies, it has made forays into U.S. patent issues and grabbed some attention from U.S. policymakers and the media with its 2018 study Overpatented, Overpriced: How Excessive Pharmaceutical Patenting is Extending Monopolies and Driving up Drug Prices.", "The organization has had success in opposing Gilead patents covering the hepatitis C treatment Sovaldi in China, Ukraine and Argentina.", "I-MAK has also been successful in advancing generic forms of Truvada in India and Brazil.", "“We’ve never said that there should never be pharmaceutical patents, we want to be loud and clear about that,” said Tahir Amin, Co-Founder and Co-Executive Director of I-MAK.", "“Our view is that the patent system has lowered the bar too much. Patents should be granted for genuinely true inventions and not for innovations where there may be utility but they’re not inventive.”", "Amin, who has 25 years’ experience as an IP attorney, argued that part of the problem was that the term innovation has been “muddied” into the idea of patents since the 1950s and that “innovation” is a different construct than “invention.”", "“The mindset of, ‘How dare we shift from the patent system,’ I think that’s fear-mongering and we need to get past that fear to get a better, more sensible conversation,” he said.", "Among the patent-protected innovations Amin felt weren’t truly inventive were extended release, pill combinations and crystalline forms.", "“It’s not as if anyone’s never combined two pills into one before and that’s a common part of the evergreening toolkit used by companies to extend their franchise on a product,” he said.", "In particular, Amin found it “shocking” that crystalline compounds could be patented in the U.S. given that the FDA mandates that pharmaceutical companies screen for polymorphic forms, which includes crystalline forms.", "“I believe that allowing patents on those forms is encouraging companies to scrape the bottom of the barrel to get more exclusivity,” Amin said.", "He added that he was in favor of granting two to three years of exclusivity to innovations that are utilitarian but don’t represent major leaps in science rather than the maximum 20-year exclusivity period allowable under the law as it stands now.", "Despite Amin and I-MAK’s stance, he also noted that there were issues specific to Truvada that may not be properly taken into account by those advocating the use of march-in rights to promote generic access.", "While he acknowledged that he wasn’t an expert on march-in rights, Amin’s understanding was that those rights could be used on the patents listed in the FDA’s Orange Book, which cover the pharmaceutical formulations and were developed in part through government funding, but that Gilead still holds other patents on antiviral combinations that would still block generic access.", "These patents include U.S. Patent No. 8716264, U.S. Patent No. 9457036 and U.S. Patent No. 9744181, each titled Compositions and Methods for Combination Antiviral Therapy.", "Unlike the FDA’s Orange Book patents on Truvada, the inventions covered by these patents weren’t funded by the federal government and thus march-in rights under Bayh-Dole cannot be exercised.", "Amin argued that these patents shouldn’t have been granted and noted that the equivalent patents in Europe had been successfully invalidated there, but he did note that the existence of these patents would likely prevent generic Truvada access in the U.S., regardless of the exercise of march-in rights.", "After contacting Gilead Sciences for this story, Ryan McKeel, Senior Director, Public Affairs at Gilead, provided the following statement to IPWatchdog, which we have included here in its entirety:", "“Gilead started working on HIV treatments in the late 1980s, when HIV/AIDS was seen as a death sentence that disproportionately impacted marginalized communities.", "Today, our medicines are helping prevent new infections and are helping people diagnosed with HIV enjoy healthier lives.", "In addition to working to develop new therapies for both treatment and prevention, we work to raise awareness of how HIV intersects with social determinants of health and understand that to have an impact on the epidemic, we need to address more than just the disease.", "Based on feedback from partners and our work in the field, we believe that one of the greatest barriers to Truvada for PrEP access today is limited awareness of Truvada for PrEP’s role in HIV prevention, which is why we commit significant investments to educating both consumers and healthcare providers.", "In addition, lack of access to healthcare services as well as lack of experience with healthcare systems are critical issues.", "These serious challenges often fall most heavily on those at highest risk of infection, including young gay and bisexual men of color.", "We are in regular dialogue with public health officials, advocates and physicians to better understand and, where possible, help to address these challenges.", "To help address these challenges, Gilead supports a broad range of programs such as the COMPASS Initiative (a $100 million commitment over 10 years to support organizations working to address the HIV/AIDS epidemic in the Southern United States) and PrEP community grants (more than $28 million in grants to more than 120 organizations working to raise awareness about HIV prevention since 2012), as well as our medication assistance and co-pay coupon programs.", "Gilead is committed to ensuring that people who are at risk of HIV infection have access to Truvada for PrEP.", "We support comprehensive payer coverage and maintain support programs for qualified uninsured and underinsured people in the United States who cannot afford their medications.", "Gilead’s extensive efforts to provide access to Truvada for PrEP (and even before as HIV treatment) clearly satisfy the Bayh-Dole requirement of reasonable efforts to make an invention (emtricitabine) available for health and safety needs.", "We believe that there is no rationale or precedent for the government to exercise march-in or other IP rights related to Truvada.", "Of note, before Truvada was indicated for PrEP, it was a groundbreaking medication for treatment of HIV.", "That was the context that led to its development and ultimate approval by the FDA in 2004. Subsequent to the approval of Truvada for treatment, we partnered with NIH and the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation for additional clinical trials that established it could also be used for HIV prevention.", "The patents owned by Gilead for Truvada relate to the discovery of Truvada and its initial use in treating active HIV infections.", "Those patents were not extended with the subsequent PrEP indication, they have not expired, and they have not been invalidated.", "Data from our patient support programs do not suggest that cost is a primary obstacle to treatment. The majority of people receiving Truvada for PrEP today who utilize our co-pay coupons pay less than $5 per bottle, and our co-pay assistance program is sufficient to meet the needs of the large majority of people who use it.", "We encourage anyone facing financial difficulties to contact us at www.GileadAdvancingAccess.com.", "Additionally, the CDC estimates that less than one percent of people who are indicated for Truvada for PrEP have an unmet need for financial assistance.", "When cost is a barrier, we work to reduce it. We recently increased our patient support programs by raising the annual co-pay assistance from $4,800 to $7,200 and doubling patient eligibility for the Medication Assistance Program from six months to 12 months, making it easier to enroll and remain in the program.", "An estimated 202,000 people are now taking Truvada for its prevention indication in the United States.", "The current Wholesale Acquisition Cost (WAC) price of Truvada is $1,676 per 30-pill bottle.

The companies said they will focus clinical testing on multiple sclerosis (MS), Alzheimer's disease and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS).", "Sanofi will bankroll Phase Ib and II testing for MS, ALS and any other neurological indications, while Denali will fund Alzheimer's Phase 1 testing.", "Adding her voice, Madeleine Armstrong writing on Vantage said that the San Francisco-based company will receive $125 million up front in a deal covering its small-molecule Rip1 kinase inhibitors.", "This target, which plays a role in inflammation, could be useful in a range of disorders, not just brain diseases – which might help explain the interest from Sanofi, hardly a big hitter in the CNS space.", "The companies have named two compounds, the brain-penetrating DNL747, and DNL758, which does not get through the blood-brain barrier.", "The groups will jointly develop the former in indications such as Alzheimer’s, while Sanofi will fund development of the latter for systemic inflammatory diseases.", "These are crowded areas, but at least the French group is trying something new; the only other group with Rip kinase inhibitors in clinical development, according to EvaluatePharma, is GlaxoSmithKline.", "The UK company's new chief scientific officer, Hal Barron, highlighted both of its projects during an R&D update in July.", "Grifols AMBAR study is important because it suggests that in Alzheimer’s disease patients, there is a protein or proteins which has so far not been identified that binds to albumen and when removed, according to Andy Smith, analyst at Edison Investment Research.", "Spanish blood fractionation company Grifols has released results this morning that one of its investigators has described as ‘the most significant development in the treatment of patients with moderate Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) in over 15 years’.", "This may be the case, but not for the reasons Grifols would like to believe. The treatment involved plasmaphoresis (similar to dialysis but the separation out of proteins like antibodies and albumen from the patients’ blood) and replacement with albumen (which is itself a plasmaphoresed from the blood of healthy patients).", "Grifols would like to believe that plasmaphoresis and albumen replacement is a viable treatment for AD.", "Plasmaphoresis capacity is very limited and used by companies like Grifols and Australia’s CSL to collect proteins from healthy volunteers that are too expensive to manufacture synthetically and sell as expensive products, like clotting factors and IVIG.", "Human albumen is the least expensive of these products which is used to treat patients who have suffered blood loss but it is also ‘sticky’ and acts as a reservoir for other proteins and even drugs and distributes them around the body.", "Grifols AMBAR study is important because it suggests that in AD patients, there is a protein or proteins which has so far not been identified that binds to albumen and when removed, improved the disease scores in moderate AD patients.", "All biotech companies now need to do is identify those pathogenic proteins that bind to albumen and develop inhibitors to them.", "Zach Hartman on the Seeking Alpha blog notes that Genmab and its partner Janssen (part of Johnson & Johnson) have made big waves in the management of multiple myeloma, a form of blood cancer that has become one of the most dynamic niches in all of oncology.", "For roughly a decade now, the management of myeloma has been undergoing a huge evolution, thanks to the introduction of targeted and \"immunomodulatory\" therapies.", "Now, there are many patients who can achieve disease control without ever seeing chemotherapy.", "For Genmab and Janssen, obviously, this means increased sales growth of daratumumab, once submitted and approved by the FDA, which he expects will occur in 2019.", "Other major players in the space, like Celgene and Amgen, do not stand to lose ground here since this news is in combination with their drugs.", "Upstarts in the field, like Karyopharm and bluebird bio, may end up being impacted by this news, as well, but only because in the future it could take longer to reach the point where they have had a large number of prior treatment lines.", "This means they'll have a little bit less of a population to work with, but in the end, there will always be a need for more therapies that can benefit the patients who are not lucky enough to achieve long-term disease control with standard therapy, said Mr Hartman."]}

The pharma industry’s major markets transitioned from the growth or Commercial Stage (“Pharma 1.0”) of its lifecycle to the mature or Competitive Stage (“Pharma 2.0”).", "In this highly competitive era, companies cannot be general mass marketers and seek to conquer the world; instead, they must make strategic decisions and focus on prioritized areas they can win.", "These approaches are analogous to the board game Risk, where players concentrate their forces on conquering a continent like Australia or South America to own their own territory from which they can grow stronger and attack other geographic areas.", "In addition, in Pharma 2.0, companies not only compete at the brand level as they did in Pharma 1.0 but also at the franchise, portfolio, and corporate levels, a concept called “Multi-Level Competition.”", "Competing with a portfolio of products in a specific therapeutic category offers companies many competitive advantages vs. competing only with a single brand: cost and operating efficiencies; co-positioning and co-promotion opportunities; pricing and contracting options; product combinations, either company-specific regimens or fixed-dosed combinations; enhanced corporate reputation and branding; better and deeper stakeholder relationships and opportunities; greater licensing, clinical and business development offerings.", "In fact, a 2011 Oliver Wendell research study revealed that focused pharma category leaders had 5.5 times greater revenue, twice the licensing deals, and 70% greater product development success rates.", "Companies have utilized numerous portfolio approaches to help them win market share and SOAs.

Yescarta is primarily prescribed for large B-cell lymphoma when the first treatment does not work, or cancer returns within the first year of treatment, or when at least two kinds of treatment for follicular lymphoma have failed.", "The strong share can be attributed to the improved survival rates for adults with relapsed large B-cell lymphoma.", "For instance, as per Gilead 2022, around 2 times more patients taking Yescarta (40.5%) were alive for two years without disease progression, and the median event-free survival was four-fold greater than the current standard of care.", "The Carvykti segment is expected to witness lucrative growth in the CAR T-cell therapy market by 2030.", "It is expected to grow at a CAGR of 15.68% during 2023-2030. Carvykti is also an autologous immunotherapy to find and destroy B cell maturation antigen or BCMA-expressing cells.", "Strong regulatory support in the forms of clinical trials and approvals has allowed the cancer drug to grow exponentially.", "For instance, on February 28, 2022, Ciltacabtagene autoleucel was approved by the U.S. FDA, promising a wider application, specifically for patients suffering from multiple myeloma, relapsed or refractory.", "Moreover, clinical trials have shown robust results with around 98% of the study participants responding to the treatment, with 78% of participants showing no signs of cancer in bone marrow or blood.", "The results lasted for a median of 22 months showing a strong premise for treatment in cancer patients.", "The Lymphoma segment held the largest share of 57.15% of the CAR T-cell therapy market in 2022. It is also expected to be the fastest-growing application segment.", "The dominant market share can be attributed to the presence of various CAR-T drugs focusing to target lymphoma.", "For example, Breyanzi, Kymirah, Tecartus, and Yescarta help in targeting the CD-19 antigen which in turn helps in eliminating large B-cell lymphoma in both adults and children.", "Additionally, lymphoma has a significant prevalence across the world which allows CAR T-cell therapy to eliminate and mitigate life-threatening conditions.", "As per Globocon 2020, nearly 544,000 new cases of non-Hodgkin lymphoma were observed in the world, with nearly 259,000 deaths recorded in the same year.", "Multiple Myeloma is expected to be the second fastest-growing segment in the CAR T-cell therapy market by 2030.", "It is expected to grow at a CAGR of 22.05% between 2023-2030.

The dominant market share can be attributed to the presence of robust technology, well-equipped operating facilities like theatres, and strong buying power for hospitals across major geographies.", "Furthermore, hospitals that leverage the in-house CAR T process can reduce the overall cost pertinent to the therapy, which increases the footprint towards such spaces.", "For instance, Sheba Hospital in Israel utilizes in-house processes pertinent to the process which reduces the overall treatment time to less than 10 days and exponentially reduces costs by at least 50%.", "As per the company website, nearly 250 patients have undergone CAR T therapy in the hospital since 2015, and have amassed patients from across the world.", "Cancer Treatment Centers are expected to be the fastest-growing segment in the CAR T-cell therapy industry by 2030.", "It is expected to grow at a CAGR of 24.27%between 2023-2030. It is owing to the availability of a wide range of treatment choices and patient comfort options.", "Additionally, patients are treated within the communities which increases the overall CAR T Treatment reach.", "Lastly, strategic initiatives taken by renowned administrative institutions will enhance patient coverage.", "For instance, in February 2023, UVM Cancer Center in Vermont U.S. announced the availability of new CAR T-cell treatment for patients suffering from blood cancer.", "North America accounted for the largest share of the CAR T-cell therapy industry in 2022 and accounted for around 66.70% of the total market revenues.", "The presence of major companies, increased government funding, and research activities, along with strong coverage via various insurance policies allow the region to hold a strong position.", "The cost pertinent to CAR T therapies on average reaches $400,000 and above, thereby, strong insurance policies guarantee patient comfort and market proliferation.", "For instance, in August 2019, the U.S. Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services announced coverage for CAR T-cell therapies.", "The move allows for covering a definitive spectrum of the senior population in the region, in which blood cancer discoveries are high.", "As per the Federation of American Scientists 2023, nearly 60 million individuals, or 18.2% of the entire U.S. population are covered under Medicare.", "Asia-Pacific is estimated to be the fastest-growing region in the CAR T-cell therapy industry by 2030.", "It is expected to grow at a CAGR of 27.64% between 2023-2030. The fast growth is due to the growing patient pool in the region along with statutory support for the products and market players.", "Moreover, increasing efforts by major players in the market for the development of technologically advanced therapies are also contributing to the market growth.", "For instance, as per Clinical Trials Database 2023, around 103 CAR T Therapies are going through active clinical phases in China while nearly 5 studies are in the pipeline in Australia for CAR T Therapy.", "The high demand for CAR T-cell therapy for mitigating relapsed or refracted blood cancer presents numerous market opportunities for major players to capitalize on.", "Major players are adopting various strategies such as acquisitions, partnerships, collaborations, expansions, and mergers to expand their market share and strengthen their market position.", "For instance, in April 2023, Wisconsin Alumni Research Foundation (WARF) and Ginkgo Bioworks entered a partnership to develop next-generation GD2 CAR T-cell Therapies.", "Some prominent players in the global CAR T-cell therapies market include:", "Revenue forecast, company ranking, competitive landscape, growth factors, trends |", "North America; Europe; Asia Pacific; Rest of the World |", "Bristol-Myers Squibb Company; Novartis AG; Gilead Sciences, Inc.; Johnson & Johnson Services, Inc.; JW Therapeutics (Shanghai) Co., Ltd.; Bluebird Bio, Inc.; Merck & Co., Inc; Sangamo Therapeutics; Sorrento Therapeutics, Inc.; GSK plc.", "Free report customization (equivalent up to 8 analysts’ working days) with purchase.

of using dolutegravir in all ART initiators is predicted to substantially reduce NNRTI pretreatment drug resistance (figure 1B).", "We also found a predicted beneficial effect of dolutegravir for all

drug resistance, the greater the extent of the benefit in cost-effectiveness by moving to a policy of using dolutegravir in ART initiators.", "So far we have considered the overall proportion of all ART initiators with NNRTI pretreatment drug resistance.", "We also assessed the most cost-effective policy according to both the percentage of ART initiators with prior antiretroviral resistance with

case, the policy of using dolutegravir in ART initiators is the most cost-effective.", "We then considered the absolute difference in mortality (number of deaths per 1000 people on ART per year) and

resistance in 2017 (figure 4).", "We found a mortality benefit of the policy of using dolutegravir in all ART initiators even in the category with lowest NNRTI pretreatment drug resistance, reflecting the benefit of dolutegravir observed in randomised trials (appendix p 4) of people without prior ART resistance.", "However, the extent of benefit from transition to such a policy improves substantially with increasing NNRTI pretreatment drug resistance.", "For setting scenarios with a prevalence of NNRTI pretreatment drug resistance of 10–12·5% in 2017, no change and failure to adopt a policy of using dolutegravir in all ART initiators translates into a median of 5500 additional deaths per year (90% range 1050–16 750) on average in the next 20 years.", "For setting scenarios with a prevalence of NNRTI pretreatment drug resistance of 17·5–20%, 9000 additional deaths per year (2600–20 650) are expected in the next 20 years if there is no change in policy and a policy of using dolutegravir in all ART initiators is not adopted.", "In the sensitivity analysis, we found that a worst plausible case scenario for the properties of generic dolutegravir (while maintaining an annual cost of dolutegravir of $44) has little effect on our overall conclusions, with the change in policy to use dolutegravir in all ART initiators predicted to be the most effective policy and to be cost-saving (appendix, p 11).", "The results of our modelling-based analysis predict that transition to use of dolutegravir instead of efavirenz in regimens for all ART initiators is likely to bring health benefits irrespective of the level of NNRTI pretreatment drug resistance because of its higher potency, lower risk of selection for resistance, and lower incidence of discontinuation because of toxicity.", "However, the extent of benefits is predicted to be greatest in settings with high levels of NNRTI pretreatment drug resistance.", "Programmes in settings with even moderately increased NNRTI pretreatment drug resistance should plan to transition to use dolutegravir as a first-line drug; as well as being cost-effective, this is likely to also be cost saving.", "The appropriate timescale for such plans will depend on several factors, of which the actual current level of NNRTI pretreatment drug resistance is an important one.", "A generic, fixed-dose combination of dolutegravir plus lamivudine plus tenofovir disoproxil fumarate is expected to be available in 2018.", "A recent announcement24 suggests that the cost of this regimen has become lower than that assumed in our modelling ($75 per year compared with $106), suggesting an even greater cost saving than that we projected.", "As a result of the WHO Guidelines Development Group process, at which these results were presented, a consensus statement was made that countries in which the prevalence of pretreatment HIV drug resistance to NNRTIs among people initiating first-line ART, irrespective of previous ARV drug exposure, is 10% or more should urgently consider an alternative first-line ART regimen that does not contain NNRTIs.9", "The WHO alternative first-line drug to an NNRTI in the 2016 guidelines is dolutegravir.", "Although recommended as part of first-line therapy in high income settings,25 some uncertainties remain over dolutegravir use.", "Data on safety in pregnancy are only just accumulating.26 There is also a concern that an interaction between dolutegravir and the tuberculosis drug rifampicin could reduce drug levels when used concomitantly, leading to excess risk of virological failure if the dose of dolutegravir is not increased.27 It remains unclear whether the extent of the reduction is such that that increasing the dolutegravir dose (from once to twice a day) is required when coadministered with rifampicin, given that dolutegravir is known to be efficacious at a dose one fifth of the standard dose (appendix, p 6).", "Lastly, some reports suggest that dolutegravir initiated in people with low CD4 cell count is associated with an increased risk of IRIS, which would result in increased health-care costs and a small excess mortality risk (appendix, p 8).", "We factored these risks into our worst plausible case for dolutegravir, but they did not change our conclusion.", "Venter and colleagues28 discussed prospects for transitioning to new regimens in sub-Saharan Africa, and transition has already started in Botswana and Brazil.", "Although we considered a policy of using dolutegravir in all new ART initiators, we could also have considered a wider introduction of the drug for all people on first-line efavirenz-based ART.", "This policy is predicted to bring further health benefits,29 and ART programmes might find it easier to make a wholesale transition in all people on first-line ART, but we do not present results on this potential policy here.", "Likewise, here we have not considered the possibility of use of dolutegravir in second-line regimens, as considered elsewhere.30 We have focused on changes in policy to deal with the fact that, due to existence of NNRTI pretreatment drug resistance, the first-line ART regimen will not be fully effective in some people.", "However, the identification of high levels of pretreatment drug resistance should also prompt consideration of other programmatic improvements, such as strengthening of adherence, supporting retention, and increasing switching to second-line regimens in people with virological failure.", "We are not aware of other studies of cost-effectiveness of transition to dolutegravir in sub-Saharan Africa.", "In a recent study of the cost-effectiveness of pretreatment drug resistance testing in Kenya,31 a low-cost point mutation assay ($30) before ART initiation was predicted to be very cost-effective.", "Such assays (adapted for integrase mutations) might eventually have a role in testing for resistance in people with increased viral load on first-line dolutegravir to identify if there is a need to switch regimen.", "Modelling studies of projected mortality differences between available policy options become necessary when data on direct benefits of dolutegravir are only available for potential intermediate outcomes of viral load, resistance, and toxicity.", "The fact that differences in the ability of drug regimens to result in viral suppression does ultimately translate into differences in risk of AIDS and death is the basis of the reason why the FDA in 1997 moved from approving antiretroviral drugs on the basis of clinical endpoint data to approving them on the basis of viral load endpoint data.32", "In our model, we capture the fact that some people discontinue ART and become disengaged from care and that this is more likely in people who are poorly adherent or for whom ART is failing, or both.", "These people are therefore likely to have NNRTI drug resistance.33, 34, 35 Nevertheless, model outputs for the proportion of ART initiators with NNRTI pretreatment drug resistance who have previous antiretroviral drug exposure were not substantially higher than for those who have no previous antiretroviral drug exposure, which is in contrast with survey findings of pretreatment drug resistance that show markedly higher levels.", "This implies an even greater tendency for interruption of ART to be more likely in those with poor adherence than was assumed, which might imply that the policies just targeted at those with previous antiretroviral drug exposure could be more effective than we have shown.", "Our work has several limitations. As is inevitable for a cost-effectiveness analysis with an appropriately long-time horizon, which is required to consider the future consequences of current decisions, we rely on a model to give predictions of the long-term effect of the alternative policies.", "Our model is particularly detailed and relies on many assumptions, although these have generally been well informed by a wide array of observed data, albeit not always directly from the region itself.", "The benefits of dolutegravir compared with efavirenz are also well supported by data. We note that, since our model includes adults only, the potential beneficial effects of dolutegravir for people younger than 15 years have not been included, and we did not consider effects on transmission to children.", "Furthermore, our focus is on low-income settings in sub-Saharan Africa. Generic dolutegravir is unavailable elsewhere, and cost-effectiveness of the transition is likely to be country-specific and dependent on the cost of dolutegravir and to be affected by costs of other drugs and availability of HIV drug resistance testing capacity.", "Although drug prices can decrease over time, there is generally a floor price determined by the production cost, so generic drug prices might well not now decrease markedly over time in the future.", "In conclusion, a transition from efavirenz-containing first-line regimens to generic dolutegravir-containing regimens is predicted to be effective and cost-effective in low-income settings in sub-Saharan Africa at any level of NNRTI pretreatment drug resistance.", "However, with high prevalence of NNRTI pretreatment drug resistance, the negative effect on the population health of postponing the transition to dolutegravir increases substantially and thus increases the urgency of this intervention.", "This paper is dedicated to the memory of our highly respected and fondly remembered colleague, Mark A Wainberg.", "The HIV Synthesis modelling group also received funding from the United States Agency for International Development (the GEMS Project).", "All authors contributed to the conceptualisation of the analysis, provided substantive input into the modelling plan, advised on relevant data, interpreted results, and commented on manuscript drafts.", "ANP, VC, and FN wrote and executed the modelling program.

In contrast, it can take years or decades to double the size of a company through organic growth.", "This powerful motivation is the primary reason why M&A activity occurs in distinct cycles. The urge to snap up a company with an attractive portfolio of assets before a rival does so generally results in a feeding frenzy in hot markets.", "Some examples of frenetic M&A activity in specific sectors include dot-coms and telecoms in the late 1990s, commodity and energy producers in 2006-07, and biotechnology companies in 2012–14.", "Companies also merge to take advantage of synergies and economies of scale. Synergies occur when two companies with similar businesses combine, as they can then consolidate (or eliminate) duplicate resources like branch and regional offices, manufacturing facilities, research projects, etc.", "Every million dollars or fraction thereof thus saved goes straight to the bottom line, boosting earnings per share and making the M&A transaction an “accretive” one.", "Companies also engage in M&A to dominate their sector. However, a combination of two behemoths would result in a potential monopoly, and such a transaction would have to run the gauntlet of intense scrutiny from anti-competition watchdogs and regulatory authorities.", "Companies also use M&A for corporate tax reasons, although this may be an implicit rather than an explicit motive.", "This technique called corporate inversion involves a U.S. company buying a smaller foreign competitor and moving the merged entity’s tax home overseas to a lower-tax jurisdiction, in order to substantially reduce its tax bill.", "In many cases, integrating the operations of two companies proves to be a much more difficult task in practice than it seemed in theory.", "This may result in the combined company being unable to reach the desired targets in terms of cost savings from synergies and economies of scale.", "A potentially accretive transaction could therefore well turn out to be dilutive.", "If company A is unduly bullish about company B’s prospects—and wants to forestall a possible bid for B from a rival—it may offer a very substantial premium for B. Once it has acquired company B, the best-case scenario that A had anticipated may fail to materialize.", "For instance, a key drug being developed by B may turn out to have unexpectedly severe side effects, significantly curtailing its market potential.", "Company A’s management (and shareholders) may then be left to rue the fact that it paid much more for B than what it was worth.", "Such overpayment can be a major drag on future financial performance.", "M&A transactions sometimes fail because the corporate cultures of the potential partners are so dissimilar.", "Think of a staid technology stalwart acquiring a hot social media start-up and you may get the picture.", "M&A activity obviously has long-term ramifications for the acquiring company or the dominant entity in a merger than it does for the target company in an acquisition or the firm that is subsumed in a merger.", "For the target company, an M&A transaction gives its shareholders the opportunity to cash out at a significant premium, especially if the transaction is an all-cash deal.", "If the acquirer pays partly in cash and partly in its own stock, the target company’s shareholders get a stake in the acquirer, and thus have a vested interest in its long-term success.", "For the acquirer, the impact of an M&A transaction depends on the deal size relative to the company’s size.", "The larger the potential target, the bigger the risk to the acquirer. A company may be able to withstand the failure of a small-sized acquisition, but the failure of a huge purchase may severely jeopardize its long-term success.", "Once an M&A transaction has closed, the acquirer’s capital structure will change, depending on how the M&A deal was designed.", "An all-cash deal will substantially deplete the acquirer’s cash holdings. But as many companies seldom have the cash hoard available to make full payment for a target firm outright, all-cash deals are often financed through debt.", "While this increases a company’s indebtedness, the higher debt load may be justified by the additional cash flows contributed by the target firm.", "Many M&A transactions are also financed through the acquirer’s stock. For an acquirer to use its stock as currency for an acquisition, its shares must often be premium-priced, to begin with, else making purchases would be needlessly dilutive.", "As well, the management of the target company also has to be convinced that accepting the acquirer’s stock rather than hard cash is a good idea.", "Support from the target company for such an M&A transaction is much more likely to be forthcoming if the acquirer is a Fortune 500 company than if it is ABC Widget Co.", "Market reaction to news of an M&A transaction may be favorable or unfavorable, depending on the perception of market participants about the merits of the deal.", "In most cases, the target company’s shares will rise to a level close to that of the acquirer’s offer, assuming of course that the offer represents a significant premium to the target’s previous stock price.", "In fact, the target’s shares may trade above the offer price if the perception is either that the acquirer has low-balled the offer for the target and may be forced to raise it, or that the target company is coveted enough to attract a rival bid.", "There are situations in which the target company may trade below the announced offer price. This generally occurs when part of the purchase consideration is to be made in the acquirer’s shares and the stock plummets when the deal is announced.", "For example, assume the purchase price of $25 per share of Targeted XYZ Co. consists of two shares of an acquirer valued at $10 each and $5 in cash.", "But if the acquirer’s shares are now only worth $8, Targeted XYZ Co. would most likely be trading at $21 rather than $25.", "There are a number of reasons why an acquirer’s shares may decline when it announces an M&A deal. Perhaps market participants think that the price tag for the purchase is too steep.", "Or the deal is perceived as not being accretive to earnings per share (EPS). Or perhaps investors believe that the acquirer is taking on too much debt to finance the acquisition.", "An acquirer’s future growth prospects and profitability should ideally be enhanced by the acquisitions it makes.", "Since a series of acquisitions can mask deterioration in a company’s core business, analysts and investors often focus on the “organic” growth rate of revenue and operating margins—which excludes the impact of M&A—for such a company.", "In cases where the acquirer has made a hostile bid for a target company, the latter’s management may recommend that its shareholders reject the deal.", "One of the most common reasons cited for such rejection is that the target’s management believes the acquirer’s offer substantially undervalues it.", "But such rejection of an unsolicited offer can sometimes backfire, as demonstrated by the famous Yahoo-Microsoft case.", "On Feb. 1, 2008, Microsoft unveiled a hostile offer for Yahoo Inc. (YHOO) of $44.6 billion. Microsoft Corp.’s (MSFT) offer of $31 per Yahoo share consisted of one-half cash and one-half Microsoft shares and represented a 62% premium to Yahoo’s closing price on the previous day.", "However, Yahoo’s board of directors—led by co-founder Jerry Yang—rejected Microsoft’s offer, saying that it substantially undervalued the company.", "Unfortunately, the credit crisis that gripped the world later that year also took its toll on Yahoo shares, resulting in the stock trading below $10 by November 2008.", "Yahoo’s subsequent road to recovery was a long one, and the stock only exceeded Microsoft’s original $31 offer five and a half years later in September 2013, but ultimately sold its core business to Verizon for $4.83 billion in 2016.", "In January 2000, America Online—which had grown to become the world’s biggest online service in less than 15 years—announced an audacious bid to buy media giant Time Warner in an all-stock deal.", "AOL Inc.

(TWX).", "However, things didn't quite go the way that AOL had expected, as the Nasdaq commenced its two-year slide of almost 80% in March 2000, and in January 2001, AOL became a unit of Time Warner.", "The corporate culture clash between the two was severe, and Time Warner subsequently spun off AOL in November 2009 at a valuation of about $3.2 billion, a fraction of AOL’s market value in its heyday.", "In 2015, Verizon purchased AOL for $4.4 billion. The $165-billion original deal between AOL and Time Warner remains one of the largest (and most notorious) M&A transactions to this day.", "In November 2011, Gilead Sciences (GILD)—the world’s largest maker of HIV medications—announced an $11-billion offer for Pharmasset, a developer of experimental treatments for hepatitis C. Gilead offered $137 in cash for each Pharmasset share, a whopping 89% premium to its previous closing price.", "The deal was perceived as a risky one for Gilead, and its shares fell around 9% on the day it announced the Pharmasset deal.", "But few corporate gambles have paid off as spectacularly as this one did. In December 2013, Gilead’s drug Sovaldi received FDA approval after it proved to be remarkably effective in treating hepatitis C, an affliction that affects 3.2 million Americans.", "While Sovaldi’s $84,000 price tag for a 12-week course of treatment stirred some controversy, by October 2014, Gilead had a market value of $159 billion—a more than five-fold increase from $31 billion shortly after it closed the Pharmasset purchase.", "However, things have since cooled off, as Gilead has a $85.66 billion market cap as of July 2021.", "This £71 billion (approx. $100 billion) deal was remarkable in that it led to the near-demise of two of the three members of the buying consortium.", "In 2007, Royal Bank of Scotland, Belgian-Dutch bank Fortis and Spain’s Banco Santander won a bidding war with Barclays Bank for Dutch bank ABN Amro.", "But as the global credit crisis began intensifying from the summer of 2007, the price paid by the buyers of three times ABN Amro’s book value looked like sheer folly.", "RBS’ stock price subsequently collapsed and the British government had to step in with a £46 billion bailout in 2008 to rescue it.", "Fortis was also nationalized by the Dutch government in 2008 after it was on the brink of bankruptcy.", "M&A transactions can have long-lasting effects on acquisitive companies. A flurry of M&A deals may signal an impending market top, especially when they involve record transactions like the AOL-Time Warner deal of 2000 or the ABN Amro-RBS deal of 2007."]}

Only Gilead is currently actively licensing HCV products.", "In late 2014, Bristol-Myers Squibb announced an intention to engage in both licensing for HCV products and tiered pricing (in which different price points are set depending on the market in which the product is sold).19", "Ensuring access to medicines is a joint responsibility of governments, companies, multilateral agencies and nongovernmental organizations (NGOs).", "Pharmaceutical companies, being private entities, must also be able to justify their access to medicine activities to shareholders.", "We have highlighted two key points of entry for pharmaceutical companies to help to address access to HCV medicines.", "First, affordability: the high prices attached to new medicines may be deterring donors (international or bilateral), health insurers and governments from committing sufficient funds to curbing the epidemic.10 Where drugs are paid for out-of-pocket, ensuring affordability is also critical.", "Second, generic manufacturers can scale up and distribute new medicines. Generating sufficient competition among generic manufacturers will place downward pressure on prices.", "Manufacturers of new HCV medicines will benefit from market exclusivity until around 2025.10 For Gilead, this monopoly has been magnified by the dominance of sofosbuvir.", "However, this lead will be increasingly challenged as other new entrants compete for market share. This effect is already being seen as prices for sofosbuvir in the United States are being increasingly discounted in the face of competition.20", "Companies should develop, with governments, mechanisms for significant price discounting based on rigorous, well researched, transparent assessments of affordability in low- and middle-income countries, clearly taking account of the needs and abilities of payers and the presence or absence of subsidies.", "Separate pricing policies within countries can make sound business sense and improve access.21 In middle-income country markets with greater economic value to companies, private and public systems can be offered different brands and prices.", "This is known as market segmentation. Proposed strategies from Gilead for enforcing market segmentation of sofosbuvir requiring patient identification and limited dispensing were criticized for risking confidentiality and adherence.22 For poorer populations, high-volume, low-cost approaches may prove more profitable: in the United States, Gilead appears to be shifting to a higher-volume/lower-price model as competition from AbbVie intensifies.23", "Gilead initially charged US$ 84 000 for a course of sofosbuvir in the United States. The lowest identified price for that treatment in a developing country was US$ 900 in Egypt.24", "These prices are much higher than the drug’s production cost, which is US$ 68 to US$ 136 for a 12-week course.25 We were not able to estimate the research and development costs for this drug, and Gilead states publicly that they do not track this expenditure per product.26 High prices may be deterring bilateral, international and national funders from allocating funding at the scale required for the widespread rollout of new HCV treatments.", "The lessons from scaling up HIV/AIDS medicines have shown that the capacity of generic medicine manufacturers to produce high-quality medicines and their knowledge of local regulatory requirements are important for manufacture, distribution and treatment.", "Equally important is the impact of sufficient competition from generic medicine manufacturers on prices: the average price of a first-line adult antiretroviral regimen dropped from US$ 414 per person per year in 2003 to US$ 74 in 2008.27", "Licensing can also make business sense. For example, efficiencies may exist in engagement with generic manufacturers who understand local regulatory requirements well, have an existing network of contacts with developing country governments and regulators and can rapidly scale up production.", "Manufacturers may derive income from the application of royalties to licence agreements, for example 7% royalties were attached to the licences agreed by Gilead for sofusbuvir.28", "To date, Gilead is the only manufacturer of new HCV medicines to have completed agreements with generic medicine manufacturers.", "The number of manufacturers12 is, arguably sufficient to engender competition and the full agreements have been publicly disclosed.29 Although the scope of the licences appears broad, they do not include key middle-income country markets with high HCV burdens, such as Brazil, China, Georgia, Mexico, Thailand and Ukraine.30 Further, it is not yet clear on what scale generic manufacturers will enter the market, nor what discounts will be realized, though NATCO, Hyderabad, India, has disclosed a price of 19 900 Indian rupees for 28 400 mg tablets in Nepal.31 On a 12-week course of treatment, this equates to approximately US$ 900.", "So, although Gilead’s licensing activities represent leading practice among the companies included in the access to medicine index, this approach has limitations in geographic scope and improvements in affordability are not yet clear.", "Bristol-Myers Squibb has also announced its intention to engage with generic medicine manufacturers, detailing the geographic scope of future licences.", "Regarding licensing, it is important that pharmaceutical companies agree to the most flexible terms possible, for example, minimizing royalties, not placing restrictions on supply of active pharmaceutical ingredients and allowing supply to as broad a range of countries as possible.", "This provides generic medicine manufacturers with the greatest potential to compete and keep prices low.", "Market segmentation can broaden the geographic scope of licences. Where patent-holders may wish to retain monopoly over higher income segments, licences can limit markets generic manufacturers can sell to.", "GlaxoSmithKline and Pfizer, via their joint-venture ViiV Healthcare, have tested this approach in the context of HIV medicines with the Medicines Patent Pool, segmenting public and private markets for dolutegravir and introducing a tiered royalty structure that enabled the inclusion of more middle-income countries.32", "Research-based companies should consider developing access strategies such as equitable pricing or voluntary licensing earlier in a product’s lifecycle (for example, in the later stages of research and development).", "This could reduce the time taken for products to reach those in need. In the case of voluntary licensing, agreeing terms with generic manufacturers early extends the time available for technology transfer, thereby enabling licencees to start production as soon after product registration as possible.", "Gilead has licensed medicines before product registration.33 To our knowledge, no other pharmaceutical company has engaged in pre-registration licensing for HCV products.", "Since most HCV infections are initially asymptomatic, it is also important to raise sufficient awareness, reduce stigma, and build screening and diagnostic capacity to curb the epidemic.", "In addition to pricing and licensing, some companies disclosed details of programmes for supporting local screening and diagnostic capacity.", "It should be noted that such activities bring with them a significant risk of conflict of interest associated with direct contact with patient organizations or health-care professionals.", "Companies may seek to manage the risk of conflict through the involvement of established NGOs and/or WHO, aligning with the needs of ministries of health and integrating with existing programmes.", "Merck & Co. is building screening capacity in Latin America, aimed at reducing the time taken for results to be received.", "Likewise, Roche, with strength in diagnostics, is engaged in building screening capacity in central Europe, the Eastern Mediterranean region and India, including awareness-raising activities.", "Bristol-Myers Squibb is engaged in a project aimed at raising awareness in China, India and Japan.", "It is clear that treatment of hepatitis C is undergoing a revolution. It is not enough however, to develop effective treatment.", "All actors in the global health community need to ensure that these new products are available, accessible and affordable for all in need.", "This goal ultimately requires a multi-actor, multi-pronged approach.", "The lack of access strategies disclosed for products under development is concerning, especially those in phase III clinical trials, which bear the greatest chance of market entry.", "It is also concerning that some companies disclosed no access strategies for either currently marketed products or products in the pipeline.", "As described, pharmaceutical companies have central roles to play, particularly with regard to ensuring affordability and voluntary licensing.", "The available evidence provided by companies so far suggests a need for more concerted, broader engagement in access strategies.", "- 1.Guidelines for the screening, care and treatment of persons with Hepatitis C infection [Internet].", "Geneva: World Health Organization; 2014.

Finally, our winners all used targeted M&A strategies to build their leadership positions—with valuable lessons about the kind of deal making that delivers sustained value.", "Over the past 20 years, and especially since 2000, building leadership in a category has become a crucial route to success in pharma.", "Seven of our 10 leading value creators, including Roche in oncology and Novo Nordisk in diabetes care, generated at least 50% of their revenues from one therapeutic area or primary care.", "In two cases—Biogen Idec in neurology and Celgene in oncology—more than 90% of revenues came from a single therapeutic area.", "Category leaders have privileged access to all stakeholders in the category. This allows them to identify and satisfy unmet customer needs, often at the intersection of science and marketing.", "Their product and regulatory functions benefit from more expertise and stronger relationships, enabling them to get innovations to market faster and with a higher success rate.", "They are well placed to understand and price the best business development opportunities, and are a preferred partner for smaller companies to develop and market their products.", "Lastly, their market presence and strong customer relationships improve commercial efficiency.", "For example, Gilead Sciences built its success in HIV/ AIDS therapies on the insight that a lower pill burden and fewer side effects were the keys to fostering better adherence in HIV patients and improving long-term outcomes.", "Ultimately, Gilead expanded its HIV/AIDS market from therapy to prevention. The vast majority of Gilead’s products were acquired inorganically, often in earlier clinical development stages.", "For 10 years, Gilead was the only approved manufacturer of multi-class combination products for HIV/AIDS.", "Gilead is now transferring its capabilities across product areas in virology by developing combination products for Hepatitis C. It has, however, been less successful outside its core category.", "For example, Gilead has acquired companies focused on respiratory and cardiovascular products. These categories only contribute 5% of Gilead’s current valuation.", "To better understand the relationship between category leadership and value creation in pharma, we analyzed a data set of 1.2 billion Medicare Part D prescriptions, using prescriber overlap as a proxy for shared customers, cost and capabilities.", "We found that the prescription market breaks down into at least 22 different category-based markets that differ significantly from traditional therapeutic and disease areas.", "Leading category positions are highly predictive of profitability and value creation in pharma. We created the Category Leadership IndexSM score to capture this trend.", "The Category Leadership Index score is the revenue weighted average of a company’s relative market shares (RMS) in the categories in which it competes.", "In 2013, the Category Leadership Index score showed a strong correlation between operating margins and weighted average RMS across the major pharma categories.", "For the typical pharma company, a 0.1 increase in its Category Leadership Index score can be expected to boost operating margins by 2 percentage points (see Figure 2).", "Category leadership yielded scale economies for our winning companies. As a result, they incurred significantly lower sales, general and administrative expenses, which boosted their profits.", "Even more striking, late-stage development programs from category leaders (RMS > 0.75) were more than twice as likely to result in regulatory approval as similar programs from followers (p=0.01).2", "All of our top value creators built distinct capabilities in one of four repeatable business models:", "Disease solution providers beat the competition by offering differentiated products and services based on deep understanding of the disease and customers.", "Gilead’s unique HIV combination therapies drove an eightfold increase in the company’s share of the HIV/AIDS drug market.", "Novo Nordisk’s leadership in diabetes care largely explains why its 2013 EBITDA margin was 23 percentage points higher than we would have expected from its relative share of the pharma market as a whole.", "Breakthrough innovators create one-of-a-kind products, with—at least initially—less emphasis on sophisticated commercial capabilities.", "For example, Celgene changed the game in multiple myeloma by developing innovative applications for thalidomide.", "Roche built its leadership position in oncology on subsidiary Genentech’s breakthrough work in developing humanized monoclonal antibodies.", "Commercial optimizers extract maximum value from proven, not always highly differentiated, products. The leading example here is Pfizer, which built a dominant position in the branded primary care category by figuring out how to commercialize acquired assets, especially products that lacked significant clinical differentiation.", "Finally, value players such as Cipla and Teva have achieved leadership in generics by deploying differentiated business capabilities to build scale and portfolio breadth in their target geographies.", "Both companies achieved success by developing differentiated business capabilities. Cipla has focused on manufacturing low-cost generic drugs for fatal diseases that afflict large populations in developing countries.", "Teva has succeeded in the US and other Western markets by successfully challenging the intellectual property positions of originator companies and being first to market with new generics.", "The pharma industry continues to evolve, with potential disruptions affecting all parts of the value chain, from R&D to patient care.", "The future success of today’s market leaders will be determined by how they react to these changes. Pfizer has already started to apply its commercial optimizer model in specialty businesses.", "And many companies struggle to repeat breakthrough innovation in a particular disease area, because competitors soon close the gap with similar products.", "To stay ahead of the competition, breakthrough innovators often evolve into disease solutions providers in the categories they helped create.", "In oncology, for example, Roche has been building a sophisticated business system on the strength of its breakthrough cancer therapies.", "Future winners will actively disrupt current business models, including their own. For example, pricing models will increasingly shift from per-pill pricing to outcome-based and at-risk models.", "Disease solution providers will move to own “episodes of care,” including diagnostics, drugs, devices and treatment protocols.", "M&A in the pharma industry has a mixed record. In 2010, Bain analysis showed that 46% of pharma/biotech deals created underperforming companies, compared with 41% for M&A deals across all industries.3", "Yet most of our winners deployed focused M&A strategies to build category leadership positions. Between 1992 and 2012, the eight core pharma companies on our list (excluding Teva and Cipla) generated 70% of their cumulative revenue inorganically.", "One excellent example is Pfizer. Since 2000, Pfizer has largely filled its commercial pipeline by acquiring the product portfolios of competitors like Warner-Lambert, Pharmacia, Wyeth and King Pharmaceuticals.", "Pfizer built leading positions across primary care by skillfully marketing a series of marginally differentiated products.", "Today, eight of Pfizer’s top 10 drugs are No. 1 sellers in competitive markets. Pfizer has also prospered by controlling costs: Despite four large acquisitions, the company’s employee head count currently stands at approximately 80,000, down from about 90,000 in 2000.", "Recent pharma M&A activity suggests that more companies are pursuing deals to help them lead within specialty categories.", "For example, the 2014 asset swap between Novartis and GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) left both companies with stronger positions in their target markets: Novartis in oncology, GSK in vaccines and consumer health.", "GSK’s Category Leadership Index score increases by nearly 9% as a result of the deal, which could add as much as $5 billion to its market value.", "GSK became the largest player in vaccines by acquiring Novartis’s vaccines unit. Novartis acquired GSK’s oncology portfolio, allowing it to solidify second place in this category, behind Roche.", "GSK and Novartis also merged their consumer divisions in a joint venture that created a leading consumer health business.", "Category and capability leadership hold the keys to superior value creation and even survival in pharma.", "Companies that stick to the old model of diversifying assets and spreading R&D bets across many categories will likely find themselves running conglomerates of subscale businesses.", "As the innovation bar for attractive reimbursement rises, they will face low profitability and negative returns on R&D. Category leaders will have more resources to invest in product development, commercialization and acquisitions.", "Because assets owned by subscale companies will be worth more in the portfolios of market leaders, current owners will risk being consolidated by the winners.", "Copying today’s proven business models does not guarantee future success. Inevitably, today’s leaders will use their market influence to raise the bar for competitors.", "However, there is good news for companies still building their category leadership positions.", "First, our data shows that winning in pharma depends on scale within categories rather than across the broader pharma market.", "In an increasingly fragmented industry, categories are often defined far more narrowly than the traditional therapeutic and disease areas.", "Over the past decade, for example, Astellas has achieved leadership positions in urology and transplants and is currently shaping a narrower category, uro-oncology.", "In the future, there will be many similar opportunities to define and lead new categories in pharma.", "Second, we found that today’s pharma category leaders only use a small fraction of the tools and tactics successfully employed in other industries.", "For example, the standard commercial model in pharma relies on unit-based pricing, a narrow product definition (pill or vial) and long-established promotional techniques.", "Third, pharma companies still operate in a high-margin environment. As a result, they often focus on defending their positions rather than doing things differently.", "Current leaders face a particular dilemma: Leaders that change too early risk losing attractive cash flows from established business models; those that move too late risk being disrupted by emerging competitors.", "In the recent history of the industry, it seems to us that leaders have more often erred on the side of holding on to old models for too long, leaving room for more aggressive players to disrupt them.", "The winning pharmacos featured here all had to make tough choices about where—and where not—to focus their efforts and investments.", "While some choices were not immediately popular with the markets, clear vision and strong leadership has delivered results.", "- What are the core categories in which you can maintain or develop a leadership position?", "- What is your repeatable business model? Does it set you up for success for the future?", "- What moves can you make to preempt emerging competition in your core business?", "- What M&A moves are necessary to build and defend category leadership positions?", "Nils Behnke is a partner in Bain & Company’s San Francisco office and is part of its Global Healthcare and Strategy practices.", "Michael Retterath is a partner in Bain’s New York office and a member in the Global Healthcare practice.", "Todd Sangster is a principal based in Bain’s San Francisco office and is part of the Global Healthcare practice.", "Ashish Singh is a Bain partner in Boston and leads the firm’s Global Healthcare practice.", "1. Pfizer’s total shareholder returns slumped between 2000 and 2008 due to patent expirations and other factors, but the company’s returns increased at a 14% CAGR from 2008 to 2012, outperforming all big pharma competitors except Sanofi.", "2. Data set includes new molecules only. Life-cycle extensions of on-market products are not included.", "3. For US-listed buyers, the analysis compared 13-month returns after the deal with the performance of relevant S&P 500 healthcare indices over the same time period.", "For buyers listed outside the US, the analysis measured performance relative to the S&P Global 1200 Healthcare Index.", "Figures exclude deals in which the buyer acquired less than 50% ownership of the target.", "Category Leadership IndexSM is a trademark of Bain & Company, Inc."]}

In 1982, Soderstrom said, Yale was already receiving almost $4 million in industry-sponsored research.", "By 1994, that figure had swelled to almost $18 million; the figures held steady between 2001 and 2009, with Yale averaging more than $15 million per year in industrial funding.", "Gilead, a company rooted in HIV and hepatitis research, also points to a long history of ties to academia.", "“We just celebrated the 25th anniversary of an interaction we’ve had with two universities in Europe that was basically the genesis of the HIV drugs we developed,” says Jaffe.", "“We’ve always been of the mantra that Gilead itself is only capable of a very minuscule fraction of the potential for innovation in the world, and that we can expand dramatically on that by partnering with the right academic institutions.”", "This recent spate of corporate agreements reflects a convergence of factors—advances in technology and a need to tap into academic research—that have opened the floodgates for academia-pharma partnerships.", "The prime force driving both academia and pharma to partner, however, is shrinking funding.", "Although the NIH budget doubled from 1999 to 2003, it has remained stagnant for nearly 10 years, topping out at $30.6 billion for fiscal year 2012.", "Early this year the U.S. Congress passed a continuing resolution that maintained NIH spending at that level.", "As a result, R01 research grants from the NIH have failed to keep pace with biomedical research costs.", "Despite these years of flat funding overall, however, NIH grants to Yale have been increasing.

The cost of drug discovery keeps rising, while many of the blockbuster drugs sustaining big pharma are about to go off patent, with few potential all-stars waiting in the wings.", "The floundering economy means less venture capital for startup biotech companies, which big pharma has recently relied on to identify drug targets and jumpstart the development of therapeutic agents.", "Pharma’s wellspring of research and development money is also beginning to slow to a trickle due to waning revenue growth, forcing the drug companies to look elsewhere for leads on drug candidates.", "Out of the search for potential fixes, academia and pharma have looked to each other’s complementary strengths, recognizing that together they have the potential for much greater research capacity.", "Schlessinger cautioned, however, that the collaboration should not be seen as a replacement for the NIH.", "Much of the cancer-related research typically supported by NIH grants, he emphasized, “do not fit the goals of the Yale-Gilead collaboration.", "The collaboration’s goals are to identify genetic changes or other molecular alterations that take place in human cancers that can be used to develop novel targeted therapies, including small molecules, therapeutic monoclonal antibodies, or biologicals that selectively block cancer cell proliferation and/or stimulate programmed cancer cell death.”", "Although the monetary perks of academia-pharma collaborations are obvious—academia gets money for health-related research and pharma has the chance to identify a blockbuster drug that stands to turn a handsome profit—there are other benefits.", "“The reason taxpayers in this country support $30 billion in biomedical research every year is because of the expectation that it is going to lead to an ability to improve human health,” says Lifton.", "However, there is a catch-22. “We have almost no ability to make new drugs and pharmaceuticals in academia.", "We rely almost entirely on that happening in the private sector.” Toward that end, he says, there needs to be a translation from basic science to clinical development of a drug.", "“I have long felt that there’s tremendous talent and depth of understanding of biology in academia, and tremendous talent and depth in chemistry in the pharmaceutical industry, and a very inefficient bridge between those two bodies of expertise that is necessary to translate basic discoveries into new therapies,” says Lifton.", "“Unless we have really effective pipelines for communication between academia and industry, we’re not going to achieve the realization of turning basic science discoveries into new treatments that are going to benefit the people who are funding the basic research—the taxpayers.”", "To facilitate new research—rapidly—the Yale-Gilead steering committee has streamlined the funding process.", "“If someone has an idea, they can bring it to the steering committee and it can be funded two or three days later,” says Lynch.", "“Even in the best scenario, the NIH funds projects nine months later from when you have your idea. So this really allows us to put resources to problems very quickly.”", "Another beauty of the Gilead partnership and others like it is that they not only foster collaboration between academia and pharma, they also encourage collaboration among different medical disciplines on the Yale campus.", "Under standard operating procedures, an individual investigator receives an R01 grant to locate one small piece of the bigger cancer puzzle.", "For example, after a geneticist identifies a mutation underlying a particular cancer, advancing that information—and securing the funding to do so—sometimes gets a bit fuzzy.", "“One of the real strengths for Yale has been the ability to build teams among clinical investigators who have access to patients and tissue samples; genomics investigators who know how to use those samples to discover genes that underlie specific forms of cancer; and biochemists and cell biologists who know how to go from specific genes and their mutations to assays to determine the consequences of the mutation that has been identified,” says Lifton.", "“It’s been really catalytic in terms of team-building across disciplines at Yale.”", "Halaban concurs. Every Thursday morning, she attends a melanoma board meeting with surgeons, pathologists, medical oncologists, radiologists, and researchers, where the discussion may turn to her Gilead-funded melanoma sequencing project.", "“To hear clinicians talking about genes, asking me, ‘What did you find out about this gene or that gene?’ is amazing,” says Halaban.", "“These things were not previously part of routine discussions. But now, the genetics of melanoma, currently mostly BRAF mutation status, changed it all.”", "Yet another advantage is that the flow of cash promotes other non-Gilead-funded research. “They’ve infused resources that we may not otherwise be able to get, both to expand Yale’s genomic capability and to build other aspects of our infrastructure,” says Patricia Pedersen, Ph.D., associate vice president for development and director of corporate and foundation relations, who played a key role in negotiating the collaboration.", "“Overall, the Gilead investment has increased our capacity, which was necessary to enable us to deliver results to them.", "In doing so, it has increased our ability to do more research, apply for more NIH grants, and get other funding.”", "Although academia-pharma collaborations create synergy through aligned interests and can be highly productive, negotiating the terms of the relationship can be difficult.", "Each stakeholder holds different core values. Academia prizes public pursuit of knowledge, research grant funding, and intellectual freedom.", "“We all have academic calendars that we live on, meaning that we want to get promoted, and for our careers to advance so that we get more grants.", "That’s why we have a never-ending desire to publish,” says Lynch.", "Both sides are working to eliminate such potential sources of conflict as restrictions on publication, problems with licensing rights, and conflict over control of the intellectual property.", "“You have to pick your partner well,” says Lynch. “It’s like a marriage. It’s really important that you select a company that fits the university.”", "“Indeed, Yale and Gilead have established strong links, productive collaboration, and common goals, and function as a harmonious couple,” Schlessinger said.", "Jaffe is an alumnus of the medical school; Gilead Sciences has previously funded faculty research projects; and the Gilead Foundation has supported a needle-exchange program and a mobile health care van in New Haven, so there is a history of camaraderie and collegiality.", "Adds Pedersen, “The company’s leadership is very academically minded.” For example, Gilead respects Yale’s mission to educate and disseminate information, placing few restrictions on the ability of Yale researchers to publish.", "“I think that Yale can feel confident based on our long-standing relationship and Gilead’s track record of social responsibility.", "We have pioneered worldwide access to our HIV drugs, signing deals with 13 different generic manufacturers in India and having a no-profit cost,” says Jaffe.", "“We’re different. The major reason is that the people who created the value are still here. We’re all scientists or M.D.s.", "The core senior management of the company has been together over 20 years. We’ve been able to maintain a certain culture here, and I think that’s of benefit for the Yale group.”", "Given the pressures on both pharma and academia, such alliances seem inevitable.", "“I believe that there is great beauty in science, and that’s one of the compelling things about being a scientist,” said Lifton.", "“But in addition, there is the expectation that our research will ultimately contribute to improvement in human health.", "Today, that is almost always going to go through an industry partner. We need to recognize that that’s how our system works.”", "Schlessinger agrees. “Many colleagues from other universities, as well as senior executives of major drug companies, emphasized to me the visionary aspects and the forward looking approach taken by the Yale-Gilead collaboration,” he said.", "“Moreover, as I believe that we are now in a golden age of drug discovery for cancer therapy and treatments for other diseases, we must come up with creative solutions to merge the best that academia and drug companies offer in order to develop new treatments that reduce the suffering caused by such devastating human diseases as cancer.”", "Kara Nyberg, Ph.D., is a freelance writer in Boulder, Colo."]}

on is a view on how we can take some of the macro-level changes going on in the industry — specifically when it comes to digital, industrial learning, and the role of technology in our way of working — and develop our strategy to programmatically address these changes from an Operations perspective,” he said.", "Their approach to this new strategy is unique, according to Bruce, in that they’re using a combination of industry thought leaders and internal subject matter experts to augment an internal analysis of where they believe they need to be in 2025 to continue to add value to Gilead and its ambitions.", "“We were looking for institutions that could provide both the academic perspective and fresh, diverse and interdisciplinary viewpoints,” Ganguly said, pointing out that NC State’s MBA program had a naturally multifaceted way of thinking, as a function of their curricula and practicum projects.", "Colleen Wilson, who leads Change Management within the Operations leadership team, believes the opportunity to leverage a diverse set of inputs (including that from the SCRC) will help guide this leadership team towards articulating a new level of ambition, and “finding a way to make people feel that level of ambition deeply within the organization.”", "What’s particularly interesting is that the “Supply Chain” piece of the SCRC’s name isn’t even what most appealed to Ganguly with the prospective partnership — it was the value proposition the SCRC offers as a “Resource Cooperative”.", "“A lot of our new imperatives need a cross-functional and cross-disciplinary way of approaching problems.", "We need teams for a particular project that may require two operations research (OR) people, workspace planning, someone that has a good fundamental finance understanding, and someone that knows digital,” Ganguly proposed.", "“Having access to NC State allows us to call Rob [Handfield] up, structure a student team with an IT MBA student, a finance MBA student and two OR folks and say, ‘here’s our project team.’", "So, I think having that consortium approach — along with the research aspects — is what really interested us.”", "In addition to the perspectives and research applications the SCRC is poised to provide the Corporate Operations team in the long-term, the group worked with three MBA student teams for the fall 2019 semester on practicum projects to address other, more immediate areas of need.", "Two of the project teams focused on sustainability efforts, with one looking at how Gilead quantifies emissions mapping, and the other at helping the company develop a strategic multi-year view for evolving their sustainability program.", "For the third project, students helped develop the company’s new supplier segmentation model, which they hope to refine and validate with a group of key suppliers.", "“Our experience with the student teams is off to a great start,” said Ken Wu, Gilead’s executive director of Sustainability.", "“The student teams and the advisors have been helpful and really receptive as we’re trying to make sure these things are practically useful.", "It all sounds really positive so far. […] I’m looking forward to seeing what the teams have put together.”", "With the fall 2019 semester coming to a close, Handfield, Ganguly, and Bruce are mapping out more student projects for upcoming semesters that will fit into the company’s longer-term Operations objectives.", "The fall 2019 student teams presented their solutions and recommendations for Gilead at the SCRC Gallery Walk on December 5th.", "The ‘Life Cycle Analysis (LCA) for Eco-behavior Initiatives’ MBA project team tied for first place in the competition.", "For information on how to become an SCRC partner, click here.", "This post was originally published in Supply Chain Resource Cooperative."]}

Both of these developments have been within the past few weeks; there is a lot going on.", "Not to mention we are heading into an election year.", "For a legislative angle and analysis, Michelle Mello and I have an article forthcoming in January’s Northwestern University Law Review examining ways to address unconscionable drug pricing.", "For an analysis of HHS’s drug importation draft ruling, I’d direct readers to this thread by Rachel Sachs.", "This post will focus on some recent litigation developments. With 2019 now come to a close, I wanted to recap where we are with California’s SB 17 transparency law litigation as well as briefly note two new cases for readers to follow who are interested in drug pricing and access issues.", "PhRMA v. David (SB 17 Litigation, Eastern District of California)", "As I previously wrote in the fall of 2017, California passed a drug price transparency bill known as SB 17.", "Among other things, this law requires 60 days advanced notice to certain purchasers for wholesale acquisition cost (WAC) price increases greater than 16%, over two years, for prescriptions with a list price above $40.", "It also contains reporting requirements both for price increases as well as for new drugs introduced with a WAC exceeding the specialty drug cost threshold for Medicare Part D. In 2019, this threshold was $670 per one month supply of a medication.", "The trade association PhRMA sued alleging that SB 17 violated the dormant Commerce Clause, the First Amendment, and the Fourteenth Amendment’s Due Process Clause as void for vagueness.[1]", "For procedural reasons, Judge Morrison England of the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of California dismissed this original complaint, and PhRMA filed an amended complaint advancing the same substantive claims.", "The Government’s motion to dismiss the amended complaint was denied on July 30, 2019 (Dkt. 55).", "This means that the case will proceed, but resolution could take a while—as in several years. On November 21, 2019, the Court issued a supplemental pretrial scheduling order (Dkt. 58).", "According to this order, all discovery except expert discovery must be completed within 365 days of the order (so by November 2020).", "Then, 180 days after the close of non-expert discovery, the parties need to file their dispositive motions.", "This puts the filing of those motions somewhere in the Spring of 2021. After the court rules on these motions, the parties could proceed to trial.", "So, perhaps a trial—if there is one—would begin in the fall of 2021 or winter 2022? It’s unclear.", "The parties have filed objections and responses to this proposed timeline. The main contention being whether and what discovery is required for the contemplated motions.", "PhRMA argues that it intends to file a motion for summary judgment or judgment on the pleadings on threshold dormant Commerce Clause and First Amendment claims (Dkt. 59).", "It contends that these issues “involve purely legal questions and do not require any further factual development.”", "In other words, they want the Court to set a timeline without the burden of discovery and speed things up.", "The State opposes PhRMA’s request. It argues that PhRMA previously raised these issues, and that the Court rejected proceeding that way (Dkt. 60).", "In the interim, SB 17 is in effect, and California’s Office of Statewide Health Planning and Development (OSHPD) has released collected information on introduction prices and price increases for Q1 and Q2 of 2019.", "The public can access summaries of this information as well as download the underlying data.", "Among the information collected on introduction prices is “a narrative description of marketing and pricing plans.”", "Yet, by law, manufacturers are allowed to restrict this information to what is publicly available. (The same applies for price increases.)", "A look at the data collected shows a range of responses.", "For some drugs, this narrative is left blank or states that pricing and marketing information is not in the public domain.", "Other drugs have brief descriptions. AveXis, for example, provides a short response for its drug Zolgensma: “The marketing for ZOLGENSMA includes promotion to physicians, direct to consumer promotion, and other types of marketing (e.g., educational programs).”", "Zolgensma, which treats pediatric spinal muscular atrophy, made headlines earlier this year for being introduced with a WAC of $2.1 million dollars.", "Other manufacturers provided longer descriptions, but, again, because they are limited to what is publicly available, they are not necessarily enlightening.", "For example, some descriptions state that the list price for an included drug does not reflect discounts or rebates provided to federal programs.", "Several statements noted that their pricing reflects a discount off of the reference listed drug, and a few companies noted that their prices take into account considerations of or principles involving “value.”", "On the price increase side, OSHPD provides several summarizing statistics for 2019 Q1 and Q2 reporting about median price increases.", "Among them, it found that “the 3-year median percent increase in WAC for all 1076 reports submitted was 25.8%, which suggests an approximate 8% increase in WAC, compounded annually from 2017 through the second quarter 2019.”", "By contrast, OSHPD notes, inflation for the same period was 2% annually. They also found that less expensive reported generics were the ones experiencing the largest overall median increase—at 130%.", "Among single source drugs, it was the most expensive category of reported drugs (WAC >$10,000), that experienced the largest median increase at 28.8%.", "In the Excel spreadsheet with the underlying data, there are a lot of empty cells when it comes to the information collected about cost increase factors and a description of the change or improvement necessitating the price increase.", "According to OSHPD, 72% “of the reports did not include any reasons for the reported wholesale cost increases due to the information not already being in the public domain.”", "Still, some companies did fill out this information. As with introduction price narratives, there was a range of response styles from terse to verbose.", "Some, for instance, provided language expressing their societal responsibility and sensitivity to affordability issues while noting that their “pricing will support aggressive investment in the discovery of innovative medicines to treat grievous illnesses.”", "Several responses across companies referenced vague phrases like “market conditions,” “market dynamics,” or “market factors.”", "Other responses also noted an increase in the cost of the active pharmaceutical ingredient (API). Interestingly, at least two companies cited “inflation” among their factors.", "One company used the cost increase factors box as an opportunity to make—what I speculate—they must perceive to be an educational plea:", "Our industry is different from almost any other, in that the price for a product often increases over time.", "That may seem counterintuitive until you realize that drugs are different from cars, computers or clothing.", "Once we bring a product to patients, that begins another series of investments so we can follow the progress and safety of patients taking the drug, develop better formulations that benefit the patient community, investigate its application to other indications and more.", "Price increases are what pay for those investments across our industry.", "This description is at least paired with a statement that the WAC price increases for their medications “is not necessitated by a change or improvement in the prescription drug”—which is refreshingly candid.", "There is more to examine in this collected information, and despite the predictable responses (as well as lack thereof) to specific prompts, SB 17 has generated a valuable public resource.", "U.S. v. Gilead Sciences, Inc. (PrEP Patent Litigation, District of Delaware)", "While PhRMA v. David pertains to drug pricing transparency, a newly filed lawsuit, U.S. v. Gilead Sciences, Inc., is a patent infringement case.", "Since there have already been at least two excellent posts discussing the facts of this case—see here and here, I won’t rehash the details.", "But, in a nutshell, the federal government alleges that Gilead’s HIV prevention medications Truvada for PrEP and Descovy for PrEP infringe upon four government patents pertinent to these regimes that do not expire until 2027 or 2031.", "This litigation is a consequence of being unable to reach a resolution out of court.", "In an environment in which high U.S. drug prices in general draw public ire for their perceived excessiveness, expensive medications supported by federal funding feels particularly egregious.", "(Estimates of new drugs receiving federal support vary depending on the metrics, but a recent study demonstrates that about 25% of new molecular entities approved by the FDA have received late stage governmental contributions.)", "For many, the claim that taxpayers are wronged by “paying twice”—first for the research and development of a medical product, and then through supracompetitive prices to access a subsequently privatized product—resonates.", "As I’ve written recently, there is some ambiguity as to the underlying theoretical justifications of the pay-twice critique.", "On the one hand, the rhetoric of paying-twice reflects concerns about transactional unfairness between the government and private parties.", "The overriding sentiment being that taxpayers are receiving a raw deal or being gouged. On the other hand, the pay-twice critique appears to reflect a fundamental concern about access to government funded medical products.", "It just seems wrong that products funded with taxpayer money are unaffordable to those same taxpayers, and the government has an obligation to do better.", "While considerations of transactional fairness and affordability can overlap, they can also come apart.", "For instance: mandating that resulting government products be affordable for all who need them might lead to undercompensating private sector collaborators thereby treating them unfairly.", "And, “fair” monetary renumeration might fall short of providing the access that patient-taxpayers may need or want.", "As a patent infringement case, U.S. v Gilead Sciences, Inc. intersects with these innovation policy discussions about appropriate system design, but is not consumed by them.", "This case is not concerned with what ought to be the connection between government funding, privatization, and ultimate product pricing in the first instance.", "Rather, as a patent infringement lawsuit, the issue is whether Gilead violated the government’s patents—there is either infringement or not.", "If infringement is found, however, the meaty practical and policy questions having to do with remedies will converge with these deeper underlying issues.", "The government has requested various damages, interest, and royalties. But, what would be done with that money if they win?", "Some argue that increased access to PrEP by all those who need it in the U.S. should be on the government’s mind in resolving this case.", "Christopher Morten and Amy Kapczynski, for instance, argue that “the government should use its suit as leverage to force Gilead to lower the price of PrEP, as the New York Times has noted it can.", "If the government simply takes a royalty but does not negotiate a drastic price reduction, PrEP will continue to strain the budgets of private payers and public agencies that do provide PrEP, and PrEP may remain out of reach of some who need it.”", "One issue the case raises that interests me is whether it could help shed light on how to think about and value different kinds of early stage contributions.", "The complaint alleges several times that Gilead’s contributions to the discoveries of PrEP were basically limited to “drug donations” (see e.g. ¶ 119), and that Gilead’s role was “non-substantive” in government funded trials (¶¶ 126, 152).", "By contrast, the complaint alleges that the government believed in the possibility of PrEP as a prophylactic when Gilead did not, made the crucial discoveries, and “has spent hundreds of millions of dollars” (¶ 146).", "Moreover, Gilead relied on these government funded trials to get FDA approval for Truvada. These allegations therefore imply that Gilead’s contributions are minimal in both absolute and relative terms.", "Supposing we grant these allegations to be true. Bracketing patent infringement worries, from the lens of parsing fair returns (for lack of a better word) in light of respective contributions, how should we think about the value of Gilead’s drug donations within the larger scheme of things?", "Is it minor? Further, if one is inclined not to minimize such contributions, this logic would also need to apply when the parties are flipped.", "Commentators are often dismissive of arguments about federally funded drugs in pricing debates because such contributions are thought to be purportedly early stage and minor.", "Yet, if one is receptive to the idea that Gilead’s purportedly early stage and minor contributions to discovering PrEP regimens are not actually so minor, these kinds of arguments marshalled against early stage government funding or contributions would need to be revisited.", "Finally, on a more nitty-gritty level, it will be interesting to see the relevant terms in the various material transfer agreements with Gilead should the full agreements become available.", "Gilead’s answer in this suit is due on January 13, 2020.", "Association for Accessible Medicines v Becerra (AB 824 Litigation, Eastern District of California)", "A final case to very briefly note is the litigation filed on November 12, 2019 by the Association for Accessible Medicines (AAM), the trade association for generic manufacturers, and the same group that torpedoed Maryland’s generic price-gouging law.", "AB 824 seeks to address the problematic behavior surrounding “pay-for-delay settlements” occurring within the patent litigation framework provided by the Hatch-Waxman Act.", "While these settlements can take on different features and structures, the basic premise is that a branded company will pay a generic company to delay entering the market.", "This delay is worth a lot of money to branded companies and incentivizes lucrative settlements with generics.", "Thus, the interests of manufacturers are aligned, and aligned at the expense of consumers who would have benefited from the availability of a cheaper generic product, or a reduced-price branded product that now has competition.", "A lot of ink has been spilled on pay-for-delay settlements. Seeking to address this anticompetitive behavior, Governor Newsom stated that through AB 824, “‘California will use our market power and our moral power to take on big drug companies and prevent them from keeping affordable generic drugs out of the hands of people who need them….’”", "California is the first state to pass legislation to address these settlements.", "AAM has alleged claims including violations of the dormant Commerce Clause, the Eighth Amendment’s excessive fines clause, and patent preemption.", "On December 31, 2019 the court denied AAM’s motion for a preliminary injunction, but AAM is appealing.", "For a quick and informative dive into some of the issues raised in this litigation, readers can turn to Michael Carrier’s amicus in support of California’s opposition to the preliminary injunction.", "And with that, 2020 promises to be an interesting year for following drug pricing and access litigation as well as a variety of legislative and executive efforts.", "Rebecca E. Wolitz is a Research Fellow with the Program On Regulation, Therapeutics And Law in the Division of Pharmacoepidemiology and Pharmacoeconomics at Brigham & Women’s Hospital and Harvard Medical School.", "She is a PhD Candidate in Philosophy at Yale and a former CLB Fellow.", "[1] Though not discussed in this post, PhRMA recently also initiated litigation in the U.S. District of Oregon over drug transparency laws in that state.", "Serra J. Schlanger has written about this litigation on the FDA Law Blog."]}

Lastly, although not prevalent in the USA (yet), the most recent outbreak of the emerging infection with Zika virus in Brazil, resulting in microcephaly of babies born to infected mothers, is cause for concern and monitoring [19].", "Very few emerging infectious diseases, including those cited above, appear to be high-priority targets for the pharmaceutical industry.", "This can be attributed to multiple factors including: the occurrence of these diseases is mostly in poor, developing countries, the incidence of disease is low and sporadic making it difficult to conduct clinical trials that meet US FDA standards, and the market size for these drugs is uncertain making it difficult to recoup direct development costs.", "Therefore, industry has focused its efforts on drugs for chronic diseases that are used regularly and consequently have substantially greater commercial potential.", "More generally, by out-sourcing basic discovery, pharma has the opportunity to save the initial research costs and be more confident in pursuing classic development as opposed to research.", "Nonetheless, an advantage for pharma in the development of drugs for emerging infections is the ability to apply for and secure from the US FDA a voucher that can then be applied to expedited review of more traditional medications.", "However, for smaller biotechnology companies, it is still difficult to obtain early stage financing if the focus is on discovering and developing drugs for emerging/reemerging infections with marginal commercial potential.", "Given the profound threat these diseases pose, it is fortunate that many academic drug discovery centers, most of them having started within the last decade, actually have a focus on infectious diseases [20–22].", "This is perhaps due to the desire to meet unmet medical need, and the need to differentiate the academic efforts from commercial ones and thus not be in direct competition with entities with significantly greater financial resources.", "As will be discussed in more depth below, academic drug discovery efforts benefit from a depth of knowledge in biology and medicine, but often lack the infrastructure and expertise beyond target identification, hit identification and initial hit to lead efforts.", "By contrast, the strength of commercial enterprises resides in target validation, applied medicinal chemistry, preclinical toxicology, clinical trial design and execution, as well as the project management infrastructure necessary to navigate a novel chemical series from concept to investigational new drug (IND) and ultimately to a new drug application (NDA).", "To establish a productive collaboration between academia and industry, and to recruit the strengths of both parties into a focused effort, sources of funding must be identified.", "These could include government sources, such as the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority, whose mission is to advance development and procurement of medical countermeasures for pandemic influenza and other emerging infectious diseases.", "Additional sources include the advance development arm of the Department of Defense for biodefense-related agents, medical countermeasure systems and its parent entity joint program executive office, the NIH, the CDC, as well as private sources, such as the Gates Foundation and the Wellcome Trust.", "Early government funding can be used to establish programs and to advance them to the proof-of-concept stage, which can then facilitate securing private funds for commercial development.", "With adequate funding, academic industry consortia are well equipped to address unmet medical needs and to accelerate the development of medical countermeasures for these infections.", "There has been a tremendous growth in recent years in the number of academic drug discovery centers [20,23].", "This has been prompted, in part, by externalization of Research and Development (R&D) by pharmaceutical companies and an enhanced focus by the NIH on translational research (research specifically focused on developing a relevant innovation into a needed product).", "For example, the formation of the National Center for the Advancement of Translational Science, and its associated Centers for Translational Science Awards, is directed toward these efforts.", "Many of these academic drug discovery centers incorporate experts from the pharmaceutical industry into leadership positions.", "In addition, a collaborative network has been formed, the Academic Drug Discovery Consortium (ADDC) [21] to facilitate communication and coordination between these centers.", "ADDC facilitates matching interests from companies in specific targets and/or diseases with appropriate academic partners.", "Their website [24] lists centers and their programs, events, job postings and partnership opportunities, all contributed by its active members.", "As might be expected, many of the academic enterprises focus on early-stage projects. A survey by Frye et al. showed that as many as 60% of the projects are early stage, namely hit to lead identification, with only 2% of projects in clinical development under an IND", "[20,23]. The reasons may include practical ones, such as the lower cost and resources needed at earlier stages of discovery.", "However, it may be strategic as well, such that academic drug discovery has the flexibility of focusing on long-term, high-risk projects, since an immediate shareholder payout is not expected as would be the case for publicly traded pharmaceutical firms [20,25].", "As noted above, the majority of funding for academic drug discovery centers tends to come from public sources [26], where the outcome is less rigorously tied to development deadlines, and generally not dependent on commercial expectations", "[27]. This is also illustrated by the aforementioned focus on noncommercial orphan diseases and ailments afflicting developing countries [20,27].", "That is not to say that a desire for licensing revenues does not exist. The financial successes of Emory, Northwestern, the University of Minnesota and Princeton has undoubtedly contributed to the high-level support of novel drug discovery programs at various institutions [25].", "However, with few exceptions, academic enterprises typically lack the infrastructure and expertise for later stage efforts to move from lead to clinical candidate.", "In Frye’s overview of academic drug discovery in the USA, it was noted that only approximately half of the centers performed in vivo proof-of-concept testing or even basic distribution, metabolism and pharmacokinetic evaluations (DMPK) [20].", "For centers that do have the capabilities of later stage projects, public funding from the NIH can be complemented by resources in kind, and/or milestone-based and licensing income from industry partners, if there is appropriate intellectual property (IP) protection for ‘new composition of matter.’", "Many academic institutions address IP matters inappropriately and focus on patenting targets and assays, which are invariably more difficult to protect and of less value.", "In addition, in some cases patents are filed too early, as the inventions have not been fully vetted.", "Another misconception is that once a patent is filed, an investigator is free to disclose the invention and it will be protected.", "Careful consideration must be given as to when an application will be published versus when the work is actually published in a peer reviewed journal or disclosed in a public forum.", "In some cases this would require delaying a publication. However, one of the main problems if one is working in a university environment is the academic promotion and tenure system, which rewards faculty for publications and extramural grants.", "This philosophy tends to be incompatible with the timelines associated with drug discovery and development [27].", "In order to obtain protection for a chemical series, publications should be delayed until the patent is actually published, which typically is 18 months after the filing.", "Several academic groups have circumvented the publish versus patent issues on chemical matter by delaying publication of the lead series and publishing on compounds or series of less interest.", "Of course, the question remains as to whether a university’s research and teaching missions are compatible with delaying publications to establish an acceptable IP position [25].", "Some academic institutions have overcome these sources of friction by creating two parallel tracks: one ‘academic,’ which is staffed with trainees, focuses on basic science and high-quality data to develop tool compounds and publications, and one ‘commercial,’ staffed with researchers with industry experience, with a focus on generating compounds with IP [26].", "The academic track would follow the usual promotion and tenure guidelines, with the commercial one mimicking a promotion system that can be seen in pharmaceutical or biotechnology companies.", "Integration would be mediated by senior management, who would also decide which track is most appropriate for a particular project and individual [26].", "With all the merits of drug discovery in an academic setting, there is consensus that using more rigorous project management and application of quality control and quality assurance principles as utilized in industry would be beneficial [23].", "An example of the latter is that hits identified in high-throughput screens should be filtered to eliminate compounds with reactive groups.", "This is standard practice in commercial screening operations, but is often overlooked in academic efforts [23].", "In a similar vein, the identity and activity of hit and lead molecules should be confirmed before proceeding with additional biological studies.", "Finally, more effort should be put into validation of targets, as only 18% of academic drug targets had any clinical evidence of validity in Frye’s survey [20].", "Partnering of academic enterprises with commercial entities that do these activities extremely well has thus immediate merit, since it would avoid duplication and wasting of resources.", "There are at least two distinct types of consortia, sometimes also referred to as ‘alliances’:", "An example is the Alabama Drug Discovery Alliance, in which the University of Alabama at Birmingham is partnering with Southern Research, a not-for-profit research institute also located in Birmingham, AL, USA [28].", "Other examples, although in the antimicrobial and not the antiviral space, include the opportunity of academic researchers to collaborate with the non-profit Global Alliance for TB Drug Development, whose own partners include industry, NGOs, governments and foundations to provide infrastructure, expertise and funding [29].", "A similar structure is provided by the Tres Cantos Open Lab Foundation, which provides an opportunity for scientists around the world to collaborate with teams with pharma expertise from GSK, as well other participating partners in the area of drug discovery and development for malaria, tuberculosis, leishmaniasis and trypanosomiasis, among others [30].", "This category probably has the most examples, such as Janssen’s alliance with Vanderbilt University and Eisai’s collaboration with Johns Hopkins, both in the neuroscience space [21].", "In the antiviral arena a prime example is Gilead Sciences’ partnership with the Antiviral Drug Discovery and Development Center (AD3C), an NIAID-funded consortium coordinated out of the University of Alabama at Birmingham (see Box 1).", "Another earlier example that has yielded some success is the NIH-funded Southeast Regional Center of Excellence for Emerging Infections and Biodefense (SERCEB), which aided Chimerix in the early development of CMX001 (brincidofovir) for the potential prophylaxis and treatment of smallpox.", "Box 1.

DRIVE was formed as a wholly owned subsidiary of Emory University and staffed with the expertise to finance and direct the development of drugs for emerging/reemerging diseases.", "It is allied to and under common management with the Emory Institute for Drug Development (EIDD). Taken together, DRIVE and the EIDD constitute a freestanding biotechnology company that has direct access to all of the intellectual and physical assets of Emory University and possess sufficient infrastructure to advance candidates through Phase IIa clinical trials by utilizing a combination of its own resources, external collaborations and outsourcing.", "Another unique dimension to DRIVE is that it can form for-profit spinouts to raise equity capital to further finance the development of promising drug candidates.", "Participation in academic consortia to leverage its discovery and development capacity is straightforward for DRIVE as the company already operates within an academic framework.", "No matter the type of consortium, the ability to find the funding to support and

mechanism through with the aforementioned AD3C is funded – a cooperative agreement research program that supports Centers for Excellence in Translational Research.", "Then, once an asset identified through these mechanisms has been carried through to the IND phase, for further clinical development, the consortium can tap into the funding available through Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority, within the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response in the US Department of Health and Human Services, as mentioned earlier.", "Of note, in the development of antiviral therapeutics, compounds with broad activity are desired to inhibit both (re-)emerging infections and more common viral illnesses existent in developed nations.", "While this implies the lack of specificity of the target/drug, molecules with these attributes are beginning to emerge and have appropriate safety profiles.", "In those cases, government funds directed toward the development of the compound for the noncommercial indication can be leveraged to support the concurrent development of the compound for indications with a better commercial opportunity.", "Derisking the compound by demonstrating suitable pharmacokinetics and toxicity profiles would then make it very attractive for further development by commercial partners.", "Collaborations between institutions with different cultures, both on value and operational levels have many challenges, and active management of the consortium is the key to success.", "First, the founding principal(s) behind the collaboration needs to be understood at all levels, from senior leadership to individuals working at the bench.", "This principle and associated mission and vision will also serve to guide the clarification and codification of goals of the consortium, and the definition of what constitutes success.", "Traditionally, in academia, publication of findings in high-impact journals and subsequent successful extramural grant applications would be considered appropriate metrics of productivity.", "This is often times incongruent with the metrics a commercial partner would typically pursue, such as meeting drug discovery and development milestones in a certain time frame, and the generation of IP.", "These two different sets of goals can often be achieved together, although the publication would typically be delayed until the IP position is secure, as mentioned earlier.", "Setting clear expectations at the outset of a project will be critical for mitigating conflict down the road, and allow the academic partner to go into the collaboration with a thorough understanding of the potential limitations and ramifications of delayed disclosure.", "One of the frequent stumbling blocks in partnering negotiations is the ownership of the aforementioned IP.", "A general framework to consider is that ownership follows inventorship, but that future revenue distributions are more flexible and distributed (to a certain extent) among the consortium partners, regardless of actual contribution to one particular invention.", "This provides an incentive to participate in the consortium, especially when multiple projects are within the consortium’s portfolio that all utilize expertise of a different subset of partnering institutions.", "As alluded to above, one of the typical strengths of commercial partners in consortia is the project management capabilities put in place to monitor and enhance project performance.", "Already important in day-to-day operations of these institutions, it takes on an even more prominent role in consortia, where it needs to be completely clear about the responsibilities of each partner party, including the timelines for execution of these responsibilities.", "Project plans ensure that communications happen between the right individuals at the right time and that decisions are made with all the information that is available.", "One example highlighted as best practice is Gilead’s collaboration with Yale in the oncology space, in which there is a continuous communication and decision making loop in operation, in contrast to the more traditional ‘quarterly updates’", "[30]. Ideally, there would be a project manager at each party, or at a minimum a point of contact who is included in all communications and has the charge and authority to follow-up on action items and decisions made.", "Finally, it is of utmost importance that the leadership involved in these consortia has the expertise to guide the success of the enterprise.", "This includes a deep knowledge of biology and drug discovery, as well as what will be required for later-stage drug development activities.", "Typically, the former will be residing with the academic partner, who will provide the innovative energy to the project, where the latter resides with the commercial partner, who brings timeline and critical path management to the table.", "However, having consortia partners who understand both activities make the eventual transition and early decisions more productive.", "Toward the latter, it is highly advisable to generate a compound progression pathway, which delineates the parameters a compound needs to meet before moving on to the next phase in the drug discovery and development pipeline.", "This should include parameters associated with antiviral efficacy and safety, as well as drug-like properties.", "Importantly, this document needs to clarify the critical path, decision-making parameters versus ‘nice to know’ studies or data that are not absolutely critical for moving the compound forward as a potential therapeutic.", "For example, the exact mechanism of action at a molecular level needs to be determined as quickly as possible and is important to know for the academic virologist who wants to truly understand the biology of the target.", "However, arguably, it is not critical in the initial phases of identifying a chemical lead series. It would, therefore, not be in the critical path, but rather on a parallel path, the results of which would inform the project much later in the development stage.", "It is extremely important to the success of the venture that the partners should respect each other’s expertise and trust that decisions ranging from budget decisions to experimental design are made with the consortium’s success in mind.", "Although a contract should be in place that specifies the exact contributions of the partners, potential gains, decision-making authorities and conflict resolution, it cannot substitute for the trust needed between individuals involved in the partnership to make the consortium a success.", "Furthermore, drug development almost never proceeds as initially planned. Consequently, the consortium must be able to accommodate change throughout its lifetime.", "Although it is too early to tell whether consortia will be successful in (rapidly) identifying and developing new therapies for emerging and re-emerging infections, logic dictates that they are the best option to achieve this goal.", "In fact, with the downsizing of in-house research and development departments in commercial operations, the use of consortia will likely expand into other therapeutic areas, well beyond infectious diseases.", "Lessons learned from the recently established consortia will need to be carefully recorded and applied to future collaborative infrastructures.", "This will help address the dichotomies between academic and commercial research cultures, and address issues, such as metrics of success, timing of publications and patent applications, collaborative decision making and project management.", "As parties get educated about the processes and values at partner institutions, information will start to flow more quickly between individuals on project teams, thus streamlining the drug discovery and development process.", "Individuals who can manage this information appropriately and have the respect and trust of all parties involved will prove to be pivotal team members of these consortia, crucial for the ultimate success.", "In recent years many viral infections emerged or re-emerged; examples include Ebola, SARS, MERS, pandemic influenza, West Nile, chikungunya and dengue, among others.", "There are no good medical countermeasures for these infections, limiting treatment to supportive care.", "The role of drug discovery/development consortia & drug discovery in academia", "For commercial reasons, these infections are not a high-priority target for the pharmaceutical industry.", "Academic drug discovery has significantly grown in the last decade; however, the focus tends to be on early-stage discovery, lacking infrastructure, expertise and funding to go beyond hit to lead efforts.", "The strength of commercial enterprises in later stage discovery and drug development, along with project management principles to ensure, is a nice complement to academic efforts.", "Consortia between academic and experienced drug discovery and development organization are thus a natural solution, utilizing the strength of viral biology in academia and drug development know-how in industry.", "Consortia are typically between an academic partner and either a not-for-profit organization or a commercial pharmaceutical partner.", "Funding is most often obtained from the public sector, such as the NIH, Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority or other governmental health agencies around the world.", "Success depends on the clarity of vision and goals of the consortium, transparency and strong management of activities at each party in the collaboration, rapid, real-time sharing of information and leadership with drug discovery and development expertise.", "Finally, trust between parties on the institutional and individual level is key to a productive relationship.", "For reprint orders, please contact: reprints@futuremedicine.com", "RJ Whitley is on the Board of Directors of Gilead Sciences.

In your opinion, what’s been Roche’s greatest accomplishment over the past 30 years?", "What decisions did Roche make so correctly to propel the company to such global market leadership?", "Mr. O’Day: I think all of us at Roche would measure our level of accomplishment by the number of groundbreaking medicines we’ve brought to society.", "In that respect I’ve had the fortune of being here for one of the most exciting and prolific times in our history.", "In oncology alone we have really been pioneers in advancing targeted treatments like Rituxan and Herceptin.", "I would say we have changed what it means for patients who get a diagnosis of HER-2 positive breast cancer and indeed many other tumor types.", "Today, many of our medicines are for diseases where there were no previous treatment options or no treatment advances in decades, such as Ocrevus for primary progressive multiple sclerosis and Hemlibra for a certain type of hemophilia.", "The FDA has awarded a total of 23 breakthrough designations to our medicines, across multiple disease areas including hematology, neurology and ophthalmology.", "I believe that level of innovation and the impact on patients worldwide is a terrific accomplishment.", "I would say many of our smartest decisions have been around our organizational model and our innovation network.", "Roche has been quite purposeful about keeping autonomous research centers, including Chugai in Japan, Genentech in the U.S. and Roche in Europe.", "We take the same approach with our partnerships, our scientists, and in fact all our employees in that we very much encourage autonomy.", "It has proven to be a winning formula for driving innovation. I would also say that we were really ahead of the curve in our strategy of pursuing personalized healthcare and our decision to have Pharma and Diagnostics under one roof.", "Slone Partners: Roche has recently acquired Ignyta, Flatiron Health and Foundation Medicine. What is it about the future of precision medicine that excites you and the Roche Board?", "Mr. O’Day: We know that we are at a pivotal moment where an exponential increase in healthcare data and having the right analytics capabilities to interrogate that data is going to significantly improve the way we develop medicines and bring them to patients.", "Data insights are giving us a much more precise view of patients and their disease than ever before. These precise insights generate really exciting potential, such as better, more certain outcomes, greater efficiencies and reducing the time it takes to get a medicine through development and into healthcare systems.", "Let’s take the use of real world data in clinical trials, for example. When you’re running a traditional control arm study, comparing an experimental medicine to the current standard of care, it’s a very time-consuming process to recruit patients for those trials.", "We could reduce time by supplementing clinical data with real world data or in some cases even eliminate the control arm altogether, for example in rare cancer types.", "This will accelerate the process and it will be better for patients.", "We are already seeing the value from data insights, but we need to make the application of these insights routine in both drug development and healthcare decisions.", "Getting to a stage where we can make that happen is going to take a collaborative effort across industries and disciplines, which is why we have acquired Ignyta, Flatiron Health and Foundation Medicine.", "We are investing in them to help accelerate their progress in their respective fields. In addition to these acquisitions, we have lots of partnerships in various areas from machine learning to data sources.", "Having partnerships with entrepreneurial companies that are leaders in their fields is very important.", "It helps us to stay at the cutting edge of innovation.", "Slone Partners: Roche as a parent company is in disease treatment, diagnostics and pharmaceuticals. With so much general convergence in healthcare today, and with the explosion of personalized medicine and wearable or implantable technology, are business lines at Roche getting blurred and are patient roles changing?", "Mr. O’Day: The degree and pace of change is greater than I have ever known. We’re seeing new players in the field, new trends and certainly patients are playing a more involved role today.", "These are all developments that are great for advancing healthcare and addressing many of the problems we need to tackle.", "I wouldn’t say business lines at Roche are getting blurred, but we are collaborating in new ways with new types of partners such as technology and data companies.", "We value their complementary expertise and they value ours. We each play different roles in the healthcare ecosystem.", "We are also developing our own in-house technological expertise and building our capabilities in data science and analytics.", "Our fundamental approach, the mainstay of our business, is exactly the same – which is bringing transformational medicines to society, but our potential to do this in a more powerful way and in greater collaboration with patients and healthcare providers is unprecedented.", "I really don’t think there has been a better time to be in healthcare.", "Slone Partners: You’ve lived in San Francisco, New York City, Switzerland, Japan and Denmark, to name a few.", "When you’ve seen the world and its people, are involved with the vital treatment of tens of millions of people, and have a greater understanding of humanity’s grandest challenges than most, now as CEO, how do those lenses affect your thinking and decision-making?", "Mr. O’Day: I feel very fortunate to have had such a varied global career and I think these diverse experiences have formed who I am as a person and my thinking on most things.", "This diversity is something I always wanted because a leader needs to be able to appreciate many different perspectives.", "Over the years, I also gained an appreciation for the many fundamental differences in healthcare in different countries and regions of the world.", "I don’t just mean at the superficial level of systems, policies and infrastructures but also in philosophical approaches to society’s role in healthcare and then of course there’s affordability and access.", "As a global healthcare company, we see that we need to take a decentralized approach and facilitate tailor-made approaches for different countries.", "At the same time, the needs of patients are the same wherever you are. Every individual wants and deserves the best possible care.", "To that end, we strive to raise standards across the entire healthcare ecosystem and going back to my earlier point, the use of data and analytics offers a precious opportunity to do that.", "This is why we’re working toward things like universal data standards and the broad availability of genomic profiling.", "Slone Partners: Are there any important, insightful questions you specifically ask Roche leadership candidates?", "Mr. O’Day: It’s valuable to get to the heart of what makes someone tick. Their sense of purpose needs to match with our culture and our intrinsic motivation of making a difference for patients.", "It sounds simple, but I always tell people to follow what makes them happy because if you really enjoy something and find it highly motivating, the chances are you’ll do well at it.", "If your sense of purpose doesn’t match with the mission and purpose of the company, you’ll only get so far.", "On the experience side, I always look for folks that have a diverse mindset and are driven by looking at problems from multiple angles.", "I believe very much in spending a lot of time in the hiring process, getting that right, hiring the very best people you can.", "Slone Partners: What makes you happy personally? What makes you happy professionally?", "O’Day: On the personal front, I know it’s a cliché, but I’m always happy when I get to spend time with my family.", "I also enjoy running and fitness in general. No matter where I am in the morning, I get up and do some exercise.", "That helps me get my mind into the day and into whatever time zone I might be in. Running is a great way for me to get out and see the cities I’m visiting and to soak up the sights, smells and atmosphere of wherever I am.", "Professionally, I really enjoy working with teams of smart, passionate people and seeing what can be achieved when you work collectively to get things done.", "I’m constantly learning and that’s very fulfilling. I like to explore new frontiers, new possibilities and remove barriers to progress.", "In science and in the healthcare industry, you’re often living five or ten years in the future and I really enjoy that.", "When you consider how much we’ve achieved in healthcare just in the past few decades, it’s exciting to consider where the next years will take us."]}

I believe we have a unique strategy in that we have both pharmaceuticals and diagnostics divisions within one company, working together to optimize the outcome,” In other words: “It’s all about getting the right drug to the right patient, in the shortest amount of time possible,” I first met Dan over the phone when he spoke to me from Basel, Switzerland, Roche’s headquarters.", "Despite the distance, he has a gift for sharing stories and experiences that make you feel like he’s in the room.", "During our conversation, he spoke with energy and warmth across a range of topics, from speeding up clinical trials, to the need for diversity in the workplace, “not just because it’s right,” but because of the creativity and divergent thinking that people from different backgrounds bring to the table.", "Born in Texas, Dan and his four siblings formed a tight-knit unit. They had to, because the family moved every couple of years, wherever their father’s job with IBM took them.", "The constant uprooting was actually a gift for young Dan, making him very adaptable to change. Today, perpetual motion seems to be built into his very essence as he works to make things better and faster in drug development.", "O’Day has never moved outside of Roche though and has been with the company since 1987. After joining right out of college, as part of Roche’s U.S. commercial team, O’Day has climbed up and up with leadership positions in various parts of the organization.", "His previous roles include head of corporate planning in Japan, general manager in Denmark, president of Roche Molecular Diagnostics in California, and CEO of Roche Diagnostics.", "He became CEO of Roche Pharmaceuticals in 2012. “It’s exciting to bring all these different disciplines in the company together with a common goal,” he says of the job.", "Spending an entire career within one company is certainly not the norm today, but O’Day has an innate loyalty to Roche.", "In that respect he’s like his father, who spent his whole career with IBM. Maybe it’s an inherited trait.", "Also like his father, O’Day has taken his family – his wife Mara and the couple’s three children Tierney, 26, Meghan, 24, and Brendan, 20 – overseas, as his moves within the company necessitated.", "(As the luck of the Irish would have it, Mara – “my adventurous wife” – was hired at the same time as O’Day, and by the same manager.", "“I always wanted an international job,” says Dan, who’s one of the lucky few who found it in a field he was always drawn to – healthcare.", "While still in high school in Connecticut, he became an Emergency Medical Technician, working with patients in need of critical care.", "It was an experience that informed his life and his sense of purpose. He went on to do his undergraduate degree in biology at Georgetown University (his thesis was on the mating habits of the Mexican beetle!), and considered going on to medical school, but ultimately decided on the healthcare industry, where he could put his education and empathy to work from the business side.", "While working at Roche, he also gained his Executive MBA from Columbia University.", "“You really do need private industry to make certain things happen,” Dan says. “I think [where I work is] where the rubber really hits the road in terms of bringing new ideas to patients.”", "With big goals in mind and eager to cover new ground, O’Day remains on the move. “I look on my work as a journey.", "There is a lot of learning every day and that’s exciting.” For all of us.", "What would you say was the culture of Roche that kept you there all this time?", "I think the most important, central theme is the focus on the patient. A lot of companies talk about this, but at Roche the patient focus underpins all our decisions.", "This way of thinking was instilled in me by my mentors in the organization and I pass it along to others: If you need to make a choice between something that is right for patients and something that seems better for the business, ALWAYS chose the option that is right for patients.", "It is something that is lived throughout the organization and emanates from the founding fathers of Roche.", "The other factor is that Roche is a very decentralized organization, with a lot of independent decision-making and creativity at the local level.", "That suits me very well and to some extent, it has made it feel like I was moving between lots of small companies, even though all the moves were within Roche.", "At the time, I applied to several pharmaceutical firms. Roche was one of the companies that offered me a position, and I had to decide which one I would accept.", "I remember asking my father, “Dad, which would you pick?” He said, “Well, who was the hiring manager that you think you could learn the most from, and would inspire you the most?”", "What he was saying was, “pick the right cultural fit,” so that is what I did and I was fortunate enough to be hired by Roche.", "My father influenced my choice of company and he has also inspired me in many other aspects of my life.", "He was very industrious and became the first member of his family to go to university, attending Gonzaga in Spokane.", "After completing his undergraduate studies, he went into a recruitment office and said, “I would like to get a job at IBM.”", "They said, “Well, we only hire people with master’s degrees.” My father who was very literal, went away and got his masters in mathematics from Washington State University.", "When he returned to the office two years later, the same people were there. They couldn’t believe that he’d actually gone off and done what they told him to do, so they gave him a job.", "That job turned into a thirty-five year career with IBM.", "Fifteen years ago, my father passed away from Lou Gehrig’s disease (also known as Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis).", "After influencing me so much throughout my life, my father continued to inspire me at the end, with the way he approached his illness.", "Rather than question “why me?” he accepted what had been dealt to him and persevered with great courage and dignity.", "This made a lasting impression on me. It is very difficult to see anybody that you care about go through this disease because their mind stays very alert, but the body gradually breaks down.", "The greater understanding of DNA and genetics has blown the doors open for our cancer research over the past ten to twenty years but there is still a long way to go in understanding neurological diseases.", "We are seeing some breakthroughs. We have just introduced a new medicine for multiple sclerosis, for example.", "It is based on a whole new mechanism of action and has shown terrific results in patients with both the relapsing and primary progressive forms of the disease.", "Other companies have also made incredible progress in MS in the past ten years but in diseases like Parkinson’s, Alzheimer’s and ALS, there is so much medical need and so little you can do.", "I am really hopeful that we will also start to see breakthroughs in these diseases in the next ten years.", "You have done a lot of moving around, first as a kid, and then within the company. Was that something you sought?", "We moved every three years when I was a kid, and both my wife and I have had a strong interest in living in different countries to learn about other cultures.", "From a business standpoint, it has been really valuable to appreciate that diversity around the globe and why that is so important, to any innovation-based business.", "I spend a lot of time focused on how we might increase the diversity of people in the company and how to bring that mix together in a way that leads to something very innovative and powerful.", "I always wanted a global career. My ideal move within the company was one that gave me the experience of a new discipline and a new country.", "I looked on my career as a journey and I didn’t have any final destination in mind in terms of a specific role.", "What I did know is that I wanted to have an enterprise-level job and I thought the best way to do that was to try to get as many different experiences as I could.", "I find it very exciting to bring all the different disciplines in the company together – from development to manufacturing to marketing – with one common goal.", "Personalized medicine is a term we hear more often now. Can you talk about that?", "The personalized approach allows us to better understand who is likely to benefit from the medicine and who is not, while we are still at an early point in the development of a medicine.", "We want to do this in every field and we are doing it beyond cancer care, but oncology is an area where we have a really deep understanding of the science.", "We are able to target specific groups of patients that are likely to benefit from a particular medicine, based upon their genetic profile and with the use of sophisticated diagnostics.", "When you are able to identify those patients, you can do clinical trials much faster and with smaller patient populations.", "I am very passionate about reducing the cycle time from discovery of medicine to getting it into the hands of physicians and patients.", "So, do you think this next state of personalized healthcare – or personalized healthcare 2.0 – is the way of the future?", "I am sure it is the future of healthcare. It’s a much more logical way of approaching diseases when you can get a very good, comprehensive diagnosis at the time of onset or preferably at the preventive stage, and then allocate the right resources specifically for that patient.", "We wouldn’t want our medicines to be used when someone is not benefiting. Every medicine has a side effect, and you are essentially adding cost to the healthcare system if somebody is taking your medicine but isn’t going to benefit.", "It will be an evolution, but I have to say, in cancer care in particular, I think we are going to see this approach used much more consistently in the next five years.", "More and more cancer medicines are being approved in countries around the world that are specific to a particular patient’s genomic profile.", "We need a critical mass of these medicines to ensure that we have enough personalized options to offer to patients.", "Eventually we will reach a tipping point and this is when personalized medicine will become routine rather than just for the more fortunate patients.", "The digital world is helping to take personalized medicine to a new level because of two things: the availability of big, robust data sets that track people over a long period of time, and the application of really advanced computer capabilities.", "Advanced analytics can interrogate the data to come up with ideas for new medicines, enable us to do clinical trials faster, and eventually to help the healthcare system determine who should be treated and who shouldn’t in a constrained economic environment.", "The discovery of medicines is all trial and error, at the end of the day. You have a hypothesis, you test it, you adapt it, and you keep trying.", "The better you can analyze the data, the more refined your hypotheses are going to be and the more likely you are to get things right first time or be able to adapt quickly.", "It has a huge effect on reducing the time of bringing transformational medicine to patients for diseases where there is significant need.", "We are really just at the beginning of exploring what big data can do for advancing medicine, but we know it will improve both the development of medicines and patient care.", "Is this something Roche can do alone or do you need to bring in other companies to make progress?", "I think we took a leadership role with what I call “personalized healthcare 1.0,” which is a combination of diagnostics and a medicine.", "Within Roche, I have had the opportunity and pleasure of leading both the diagnostics and pharmaceuticals divisions, and our strategy has always been to have colleagues working together at the intersection of these two fields.", "Now we are evolving this to “personalized healthcare 2.0” with the use of advanced data and analytics.", "As part of that, we have added some external partners from the fields of data and analytics.", "One of these is Foundation Medicine in Boston, a company that performs deep analyzes of the genomic profiles of cancer patients and compares them with existing profiles in their database to generate valuable insights.", "We have another exciting collaboration with a company in New York called Flatiron Health. They have electronic medical records from around 1.5 million patients in the United States through their network of cancer treatment centers.", "Flatiron is able to curate reams of structured and unstructured information from those records, creating a very powerful database that shows how patients progress over time in the real-world setting.", "Even as a large company, we believe that the vast majority of innovation happens outside of our walls, so having these partnerships with entrepreneurial companies that are leaders in their fields is very important.", "It helps us to stay at the cutting edge of innovation and I find it extremely exciting.", "It starts with hiring smart people. I think it’s key to surround yourself with people who are smart, confident, and can challenge you.", "My job as a leader is to provide feedback, to remove obstacles, to do everything possible to make that person and their mission successful.", "The more senior I’ve become in my career, the more opportunity I have had to cut through things that aren’t working well in the organization.", "My leadership style is getting clear on what success looks like and then spending my time going around, removing obstacles, coaching, providing feedback.", "I look for people that have had diverse experiences and are passionate about looking at problems from a different angle.", "There are a lot of jobs that require very specific technical skills and some that are more general, so on the skill side, we look for people that are really thoughtful, very well educated and feel confident in their field of expertise, but then, on the experience side, I always look for folks that have a diverse mindset.", "It is really fundamental to my leadership style because I believe very much in spending a lot of time in the hiring process, getting that right, hiring the very best people you can with the criteria I described.", "Can you talk a little bit about your own wellness approach? I hear that you took part in an Ironman triathlon.", "In my university years, I was more into music than sports. I played trumpet at that time, but found it was difficult to keep up with the music during my professional life.", "I took up running as a way of maintaining my mental and physical stamina.", "I start most of my days with running or some type of exercise, and I find that my mind works really well for the rest of the day when I’ve done this.", "It enables me to stay physically fit, too, but I do it more for the mental benefit.", "I like to have a goal, so I started running races and got into marathons and then triathlons. I like nothing more than to go out for a two-hour run and just have my thoughts to myself, whether that is working through a problem or switching off for a while.", "Eventually I started doing Ironman triathlons and am happy to say I completed five so far, as well as some half-Ironman competitions.", "I enjoy the lifestyle that goes along with triathlons and I like the people that do them. I don’t approach them in a very competitive way.", "It’s more about having a goal and pushing myself to achieve it.", "Yes, very much so. The perseverance of my Irish ancestors is a daily motivation to me professionally and personally.", "My dad made a point of making sure we went back to Ireland, and traced our roots to Ennis, County Clare.", "He brought the whole family back at different intervals in our lives. I have been very touched by my visits back there.", "We don’t have a direct connection with relatives, but we have run into other O’Days doing their pilgrimage at the O’Dea Castle.", "My great-grandfather, Richard O’Day, was born in 1853 in Berlin, Wisconsin, and he was first generation.", "If I understand the history right, he was working a bit on the railroads, and eventually my grandfather transitioned from the railroad to oil refinery work in Montana.", "My dad grew up in Cut Bank, Montana. There was still very much this spirit of perseverance and hard work in the family; there was a connection to our Irish heritage, and a sense of trying to establish yourself in a new country, as an Irish American.", "Clare is known for the quality of its traditional musicians. Was there music in the O’Day family?", "It is so interesting you say that about Clare, because the last time I was in Ennis, I was so inspired by all the musicians on the street.", "My grandmother played piano and my siblings and I were all exposed to music at a young age. I started with piano and then got into the trumpet, and it became a great passion of mine.", "I miss it actually. Maybe I can spend some of my retirement back in Clare, trying to earn a keep by playing trumpet on the street."]}

As the fans swarmed the field, Cubs center fielder Solly Hofman continued to run after the batted ball.", "Johnny Evers, Cubs second baseman, stood on the bag screaming for Hofman to throw him the ball. Under the rules, if Merkle was forced out at second, the run would not count.", "Hofman threw the ball off the mark into the infield, where a Cubs player picked it up. Seeing what was happening, New York’s Joe McGinnity wrested the ball from the player and threw it into a crowd of fans behind third base.", "Evers eventually got a baseball – if it was the actual game ball, nobody will ever know for sure – and stood on second base, declaring a force out.42 Cubs shortstop Joe Tinker pleaded with base umpire Emslie to call the out; but Emslie said that in the chaos he did not see if Merkle had touched second base.", "O’Day, however, was watching everything. Hank conferred with his partner, told him that Merkle did not touch second base, and Emslie called the force out.", "O’Day then nullified the “winning” run and proclaimed the game a tie. The game did not continue into extra innings because O’Day determined that by the time the grounds were cleared of fans, it would have been too dark for further play.", "The riotous mob of fans surrounding O’Day in the middle of the diamond “began pounding him on all available parts not covered by the protector, while the unfortunate attackers on the outside began sending messages by way of cushions, newspapers, and other missiles.", "”43 Police officers rushed in to rescue the umpires and escort them to the safety of their dressing room.", "National League President Harry Pulliam later denied all protests and upheld O’Day’s decision.

A rookie umpire was often assigned to work with him so that the neophyte could learn from the master.", "When there was a particularly important series between contending teams, ones involving great pressure and large riotous crowds, O’Day was the man selected to work the games.", "As durable as O’Day was, there are several gaps in his career explained by the many illnesses and injuries he suffered while umpiring.", "There were the many bruises and beatings he sustained from irate fans charging onto the field after one of his calls.", "Foul balls were particularly treacherous: One broke his toe, requiring two players to take his place as umpire; another one smashed through his mask, producing a nasty gash on his cheek and severely injuring his jaw; and yet another inflicted a head wound requiring an operation for removal of a piece of bone from behind his ear.", "He was seriously ill one entire season with recurring stomach problems brought on by stress. In other seasons, a robust case of influenza knocked him out for several weeks and an attack of appendicitis in St. Louis meant an ambulance trip to the hospital.", "“World Series assignments clearly reveal the greatest umpires in any given era, as well as in baseball history,” wrote Larry Gerlach.44", "And Hank O’Day’s World Series record is truly astounding. When the first modern World Series was established in 1903, the two leagues were asked to send their best umpire to work the best-of-nine Series.", "The National League selected O’Day; the American League chose Tommy Connolly. What is extraordinary is that the two umpires did not alternate their positions during the Series.", "O’Day worked the plate for the first four games, with Connolly serving as the base umpire.

Surprisingly, the usually progressive O’Day also initially opposed the two-umpire system.", "He said an umpire “has more trouble working double than single, as in many cases he not only has to make his own decisions, but sometimes his mate’s as well.”50", "He said this not long after he had to help his partner make the call in the Merkle incident. O’Day, of course, understood that two umpires can cover and control a game much better than one and quickly became an avid supporter of the double-umpire system.", "He umpired long enough to see three and even four arbiters being assigned to regular-season games.", "As influential as O’Day was in other areas, his most far-reaching impact concerned baseball rules. His contributions in the development of baseball have significantly helped the sport evolve into the great game it is today.", "Hank O’Day was the most prominent member of baseball’s Joint Rules Committee in his time, with his vote and opinion carrying considerable weight.", "Whenever a new playing or scoring rule was proposed, or a question arose on how an established rule should be interpreted, baseball authorities would first turn to O’Day for advice and counsel.", "“His brain is an encyclopedia of all the rules of the game,” said longtime baseball man Ted Sullivan.51", "Hank was the originator of the “foul-strike rule,” in which the first two foul balls struck by a batter are strikes; previously, an uncaught foul was essentially a “no pitch.", "”52 The rule, still in use today, has had a massive impact on the game. O’Day pushed for the rule requiring the catcher to remain directly behind the plate throughout an at-bat because it made for better officiating in the fair/foul and ball/strike calls.", "Previously, the catcher would stand far behind home plate when there were runners on base.

In 1920 sportswriter Fred Lieb proposed that whenever a player hits a game-winning home run out of the park (what we call a “walk-off” today), he should get credit for the home run and all the RBIs for any runners on base.", "Previously, for example, in a tie game in the bottom of the ninth with a runner on third base, a batter hitting a home run got credit for only a single on the theory that the game ended as soon as the baserunner from third scored.", "O’Day vociferously argued against this proposal, stating that the rule is “sacred and untouchable” that no run can be scored after the winning run has crossed the plate.", "When the measure was passed 5-1 by the Joint Rules Committee, he pounded on the table, shouting, “I’m telling you, it’s illegal.", "O’Day was renowned for his moral character as well as for being an odd character. “He was an umpire and nothing else,” said NL President John Heydler.55 Baseball consumed every fiber of his being, leaving little time for anything else.", "O’Day was described as “this strange character who lived in a shell, emerging only when he visited the field to render his decisions.", "”56 With no interest in anything but baseball, he rarely attended parties, the theater, movie houses, or any social event.", "He had no hobbies, other than relaxing at the race track.57", "You could count the number of O’Day’s friends on Mordecai Brown’s right hand. “He preferred his own company,” said Lieb.", "“He minded his own business and expected others to do the same.”58 One offseason, O’Day traveled from Chicago to Ontario to visit fellow umpire Bob Emslie, but O’Day’s “idea of a good time was to sit for hours on Emslie’s front porch in complete silence.59", "A lifelong bachelor, O’Day never owned a home. He preferred to live in solitude in hotels and dine alone in restaurants.", "He would spend his winters working out so that he would be in proper shape to meet the demands of the long baseball season.", "In his off-hours he sat by himself in hotel lobbies reading nothing but baseball publications and the rulebook.", "If a player, fan, or sportswriter approached, he would wave them away unless they were there to talk baseball.", "A cheerful greeting from others would be met with a grumble.", "O’Day’s lack of a sense of humor contrasted equally to his towering sense of honor. “It is a National League tradition that Henry has never yet been known to smile,” commented a Baseball Magazine reporter.60 Christy Mathewson claimed to have seen O’Day laugh once, explaining that his “face acted as if it wasn’t accustomed to the experience and broke out in funny new wrinkles.", "”61 Even some of his fellow umpires referred to him as “Groucho” behind his back.62 Bill Klem called O’Day a “misanthropic Irishman” who “wouldn’t speak a civil word to anybody.", "”63 O’Day’s somber unsmiling face earned him the nickname “The Reverend.”64", "During an interview, NL President John Heydler talked about what it takes to be a great umpire: “The successful umpire must live the life of a hermit, apart from the friendships of the player and fans.", "He must be a man without a country, home or haunt in the world of baseball.

Be on top of every play, so you’re in position to make the decision.’", "… He recommended me to the National League. I was very fortunate to learn from a great umpire like Hank O’Day.", "On October 2, 1927, O’Day worked the Cubs-Cardinals game as the third-base umpire in a four-man crew.", "Nobody knew it at the time but the game featured the oldest man to ever umpire a major-league game. O’Day was 68 years and 86 days old.", "During the 1927 season, he had been behind the plate only a dozen times out of 147 games, quite a contrast to his younger days.", "At the end of the season, Heydler took O’Day off active duty, conferred him the title “umpire emeritus,” and offered him a job as umpire scout.", "Grumbling, O’Day accepted it “with regret” because, in his heart, he wanted to continue umpiring.74 He spent the next few years touring baseball’s sandlots and minor-league parks, instructing and developing young umpires.", "O’Day umpired in 35 major-league seasons, particularly notable in an era when there were no unions and umpires signed one-year contracts.", "In the early months of 1935, baseball fans read various reports of O’Day being seriously ill. In his final days, he was delirious, muttering about games he had umpired years earlier.", "He could go through a catalog of more than 4,000 games, each one with a different story, some thrilling, many routine, others amusing or trivial, and more than a few dangerous.", "There was that game in 1898 when a fast-burning fire destroyed the old wooden Sportsman’s Park in St. Louis.", "O’Day and players from both teams were heroes by creating a makeshift chute from the dugout benches for fans to slide down to the field to escape the burning grandstand, and then leading them to safety through an exit untouched by the flames.75 Or that game when Luther Taylor, a deaf-mute, swore at O’Day with sign language only to be surprised when O’Day signaled back that he was ejected from the game.", "Taylor was unaware that O’Day, having had deaf parents, was fluent in American Sign Language. Maybe, as O’Day lay dying, he remembered his extended work on October 2, 1920, when he umpired the only twentieth-century major-league tripleheader with partner Peter Harrison.76 O’Day may have recalled that time he learned that Giants shortstop Bill Dahlen was purposely getting ejected from games so that he could leave early and go to the race track, so O’Day refused to toss him despite being called “a big beer-soaked, fat-headed loafer and thief.”77", "And, of course, there was that game when the zany Rabbit Maranville humiliated him when he stole second base by sliding between the umpire’s legs.", "On July 2, 1935, Hank O’Day died in Chicago of bronchial pneumonia, six days shy of his 76th birthday.", "To the end, he was still drawing pay as a NL “advisory umpire. ”78 His funeral service, held in St. Jariath Catholic Church, was attended by many baseball dignitaries with major-league umpires serving as pallbearers.79 He left no will; his sole heir was Henry McNamara, a nephew who had been named after him.", "O’Day was buried in Calvary Cemetery in Evanston, Illinois.", "The Chicago Tribune ran a feature on the venerated arbiter, saying O’Day was “one of those blunt, rugged characters who seldom allowed his crusty exterior to reveal the really warm heart beneath.", "Hank O’Day’s bark was worse than his bite. He was a great umpire, one of the game’s greatest, courageous, honest, and with a thorough knowledge of the rule subtleties.”80", "In announcing O’Day’s death, virtually every newspaper included in its headline the name Merkle.

As fine an arbiter as Connolly was, O’Day had always been considered the greater umpire and more influential.", "Simply put, Connolly was an American League umpire while O’Day was a National League umpire. When the electors honored NL umpire Klem, they wanted an umpire representing the AL in the Hall of Fame.83", "After Klem and Connolly, it would be another 20 years before another umpire was elected. Subsequently, six other outstanding umpires were inducted.", "O’Day, arguably the best of them all, was always overlooked. Baseball historian David Anderson endorsed O’Day and wondered why he had not already been bequeathed the big honor.", "“That he is not in the Hall of Fame is an oversight,” Anderson wrote. “This is partly a function of the fact that he never married; baseball was his love, and he had no family to lobby for him.", "Conspiracy buffs may believe the oversight to be a measure of revenge by New York sportswriters for O’Day’s decision in the infamous Merkle game, but more likely it is because O’Day was not known to be a particularly friendly person.”84", "Anderson is correct but ironically, the explanations for O’Day not having been honored are reasons why he should be honored.", "For O’Day, baseball was indeed his love, which came at the expense of not having the comfort of family and friends.", "He was also not “a particularly friendly person,” but this was because he did not want to get close to anyone to ensure that his integrity as an umpire was never compromised.", "O’Day’s credo was “I know no friends nor enemies on the field,” an attitude that extended to his private life.85 Nonetheless, it was through his forceful will and personality, at great personal sacrifice to him, that the game was enriched.", "As for the Merkle incident, there is no better demonstration of O’Day’s integrity, one of the criteria for the Hall of Fame.86 That fateful day, it would have been easier to have just walked off the field when the “winning” run scored, but that would not have been the ethical thing to do.", "Bill Klem’s remarks also did not help O’Day’s chances of reaching Cooperstown. He called the Merkle ruling “the rottenest decision in the history of baseball.", "… It was bad umpiring. ”87 On the contrary, it was a courageous decision and excellent umpiring. It was a betrayal by Klem of his former partner and the man who helped Klem become a major-league umpire.", "Of course, Klem waited until O’Day had been dead for 16 years before making his craven criticism.", "Klem is universally recognized as “the greatest umpire in baseball history” and is much more celebrated than his contemporary Hank O’Day.88", "The two men had quite different philosophies regarding their profession.

But the launch of Sovaldi was not met with hosannas.", "Instead, Gilead was vilified for the drug’s list price of $1,000 per pill–a total of $84,000 per course of treatment.", "Looking back, does Milligan feel that such pricing was a mistake? Here are some of the things he had to say to the FORBES audience:", "Yeah, it was an interesting launch for the HCV product. We priced the product at exactly the same as the existing standard of care, which worked about 50% of the time, and are providing a benefit that, based on real world experience, works about 98% of the time.", "From our perspective, it was a very good value. What happened was a failure to understand exactly how many people were direly ill and had to come into care.", "That is, there were hundreds of thousands of people who needed this immediately, whose doctors felt that they needed this immediately.", "The surge into the system was very large, and that created a lot of anxiety around the payers and of course created an outcry against us for having mispriced the product.", "As Milligan pointed out, no one questions the value of the product. Not only are people cured of HCV, an enormous amount of savings is accrued by the health care system down the line as Sovaldi reduces the ultimate consequences of HCV: cirrhosis of the liver, liver failure, the need for liver transplants, liver cancer and, ultimately, death.", "But despite the tremendous benefits of Sovaldi, Milligan took a contrite tone:", "I think our failure, if I have to take a step backwards, we were unable to have a good enough conversation with the payers.", "Perhaps we were a little conservative about what we could have or should have said to them to allow them to prepare for the number of patients that came forward.", "Honestly, it was far more than we thought. We did not think the system could or would try to handle as many patients as it did.", "We essentially quadrupled the number of patients treated in a year. That surge really created a lot of pain.", "Milligan is being overly apologetic. Payers certainly know how many of the patients in their plans have HCV.", "Furthermore, the FDA approval of Sovaldi couldn’t have been a surprise. The clinical trials for this drug were well publicized, as were the remarkable results.", "Payers often claim that they will pay for true value. Sovaldi certainly demonstrated that both in terms of benefiting patients as well as offering reduced healthcare costs.", "This is a life-saving drug. Their outcry against Gilead’s list price goes against the claims that this is the type of therapy they want the biopharmaceutical industry to produce.", "But note that the discussion focused on Sovaldi’s list price. In fact, as other companies like Merck and AbbVie came up with their own HCV cures, the price to the U.S. payers dropped precipitously.", "In fact, the U.S. pays less for HCV drugs than in those countries where drug prices are regulated, like the U.K and Germany.", "The original price of Sovaldi was reasonable. But curing patients of HCV for $50,000 or less is a bargain compared to the cost of previous, less effective treatments.", "Sovaldi is a great example of the value that innovative drugs can bring to us all. Yes, there are terrible examples of price gouging such as irresponsible price hikes for generic drugs like Daraprim, or wanton price increases that some companies will make for their drugs two or three times a year.", "But Gilead didn’t do that. If a company is not going to get very good pricing for excellent new drugs, then the biopharmaceutical industry will likely stagnate and many new opportunities for drug R&D will not be able to be funded.", "This was a great opportunity for Gilead’s CEO to voice these issues. It’s too bad he didn’t."]}

I spent one night here with my friend Maria’s family on the front end of Spring Break, a stop on the way to JFK airport.", "On that very short but formative visit, I remember three things about Rye: sidewalks, a store called Rags, and a park that leads to a beach that leads to the sea.", "The sidewalks stood out because I love going for long walks. My childhood in Pennsylvania lacked very little, but my town had few sidewalks.", "The sidewalks in Rye connected everyone in town in a way that was more small city than suburb. This is a place where people can travel on foot and where houses are close together, not a sprawling suburb with subdivisions of homes set on a half-acre or more.", "Maria and I walked on one of those sidewalks to arrive at the most adorable town center, Purchase Street.", "Maria’s tour of Rye was brief but left an impression, and the highlight of it was Rye Town Park. We didn’t even go into the park or see the beach, but as she drove from her neighborhood, where colonial homes sat on postage-stamp lots, over to Forest Avenue and along the town park, she casually commented, “That’s the park and the beach, and we ride our bikes there with friends.”", "Until that moment, I probably hadn’t looked at a map of Rye to know it was on the water. I peered out the window at the sidewalk, stone wall, rolling hills, brown grass turning to green, a small pond, and pavilions while I imagined the sand and sea beyond it.", "I wanted to ride my bike there with friends. Not a bad place to grow up, I thought.", "We left before sunrise for Florida, and other than a graduation party and Maria’s wedding, I did not venture north of the five boroughs to visit Rye or this gem of a park until five years ago.", "Nearly twenty years and three kids later, having spent my entire adult life in New York City, we started to ask some What If questions.", "Those questions led us to Rye, and back to that park and beach from my rose-colored, youthful memory.", "Rye Town Park is one of the reasons we moved here. It is probably one of the reasons many people from the city move here.", "As with urban living, Rye offers neighbors an arm’s length away and public green spaces where people in the community can gather.", "My family treasures the Rye Nature Center. Edith Read is truly a sanctuary, and we walk the trails and rocky beaches, watching the osprey fly overhead.", "One could spend the whole day exploring the Marshlands, watching the ecosystem change as the tides rise and recede.", "But it is Rye Town Park that fills me with that feeling of community, the place where triathletes train, dog lovers gather, families with children meet, brave swimmers plunge in cold water, friends whose children have grown and flown walk hand-in-hand with their spouse on the boardwalk, philanthropists raise awareness, and a cross-section of Rye weaves a web of spontaneity and joy.", "The unique placement of this park, a green space on the waterfront, has always struck me as serendipitous.", "In a town where real estate is key, how did this park on the water come to be? After years of teaching students about my beloved Central Park and the lost Seneca Village, a community displaced to secure Olmstead and Vaux’s urban oasis, I started to wonder, how did Rye get so lucky?", "What was here before? The pavilions, bathhouses, boardwalk and Playland in the distance tell a piece of the story, but it turns out there is much, much more that we can no longer see, unless we look beyond the grass, sand and aging structures and turn back time.", "What if a few things had been different, and we did not have Rye Town Park?", "At the end of Dearborn Avenue, one can stand and imagine a very different scene in the late 1800s. The land where the park stands was not a park at all.", "This land was owned by the Halsted family who owned the Knapp house, and in 1880, William B. Halsted built an inn at the end of Dearborn Avenue called Oakland.", "People started coming from near and far for day trips or vacations, many on the daily ferries that crossed the Sound from Oyster Bay, Long Island to Rye.", "Ferries quickly expanded their service to include New York City and towns along the water in Westchester and Connecticut.", "With the increasing crowds, the Halsteds recognized a fantastic real estate opportunity. Around 1890, Augustus Halsted started allowing people to build summer bungalows on the property.", "He collected the rent for them, $60-$90 a season. Some local residents rented out their year-round homes in town to live in a bungalow for the summer.", "The Seventh New York Regiment had its own row of platform beach tents. This quickly grew into a village of over 200 bungalows bustling with residents and day trippers.", "J. Henry Halsted was the proprietor of the bungalow community in the early 1900s, and he installed lamps along the beach for evening swimming as well as bath houses and canoe rentals.", "With grocery stores, a pharmacy, hotels, restaurants and other amenities further down the beach in the Rye Beach area, a family could live at Oakland Beach all summer quite happily.", "A giant slide and waterfront snack bar added to the convenience and fun. In the heart of the action, the Westchester Beach Club built a clubhouse around the turn of the century on Dearborn Avenue with seven sleeping rooms, changing rooms and a large dining room and parlor for gatherings.", "The trolley line ran from town to the beach, making summer life on the water even more accessible.", "Changes happened quickly from the time the first bungalow was built to when Rye Town Park became a reality, and fortunately, the stars aligned and our park gained a lasting foothold.", "Starting around the turn of the century, debates grew over how best to secure public access to Oakland Beach and whether the Village or the Town would maintain the public space.", "Opposing a public space were wealthy landowners who preferred a private sale of the Halsted land over a potentially noisy and crowded park.", "With mounting support for a park, George Slater of the Rye Town Counsel drew up a proposition to make Oakland Beach a Town park and on election day in 1907, all election districts in the Villages of Rye and Port Chester and the Town of Rye approved the proposition.", "In 1908, the State of New York authorized the Town of Rye to acquire the Halsted Property for Rye Town Park.", "Augustus Halsted received a fair price for his property and the bungalows were dismantled or in some cases, moved to other nearby locations to form new residential streets.", "Josiah Bulkley created Bulkley Manor by lining a dirt road with bungalows.", "By 1909, the town had cleared the path for the park’s construction. In less than two years, the Town’s new team of architects and landscape designers built a lasting future for Rye Town Park.", "The architecture firm of Upjohn and Conable designed the buildings, and the landscape architecture firm of Brinley and Holbrook designed the park.", "Construction took place during 1909 and early 1910, with the park and beach opening in time for the 1910 summer season.", "While teams worked quickly and efficiently, the resulting construction is exceptional and enduring, part of what has given Rye Town Park a significant place among historic and architectural landmarks.", "The Spanish Revival or Mission style bathhouses and pavilions were the keystone of the Park’s design.", "This architecture, popular in California at the time, was part of the Craftsman aesthetic. It is reflected in some craftsman-style homes in neighborhoods surrounding the park, also built in the early 1900s.", "The crowded bungalow village became a park of rolling hills and paths, with the signature duck pond in the middle.", "The view north from the pier on Dearborn was transformed by the dramatic towers and stucco walls of the pavilions and bath houses.", "Off in the distance, visible from the end of Dearborn Avenue and only a walk away, are the hotels and amusements of Rye Beach.", "In 1909, the ferry service began taking automobiles on board and became the first car ferry across the Long Island Sound.", "The park’s quiet paths gave some respite to the crowded waterfront, leading real estate investors to focus their efforts on Oakland Beach.", "In the 1920s, just south of Dearborn Avenue, J.P. Magner built his “Million Dollar Bath and Pool,” advertised as the biggest in the east.", "In addition to the pool, it had sport courts and a dance hall. Famous stunt actors Johnny Weismuller and Buster Crabbe led pool exercises and did tricks off the high dive.", "At first, Magner ran the pavilion just north of Dearborn Avenue as part of his complex. When he lost control of that, he built his own enormous pavilion.", "The complex was open from 1928-1966, and in 1970 Water’s Edge was built on what was Magner’s Million Dollar complex.", "With all this change, it feels almost miraculous that Rye Town Park and that short stretch of beach we call Oakland Beach, less than a half mile long, are today very much what their designers envisioned over a century ago.", "The towers and pavilions are in disrepair, and we continue to debate the best use of the space, best ways to maintain it, and best sources of revenue.", "Restaurants change hands. Ferries no longer run, a detail for which the residents on Dearborn Avenue are likely grateful.", "New visitors and residents arrive; new traditions take hold. This year, a family in town convinced enough people that the park needed a treelighting ceremony and holiday sing-along.", "Hundreds of us gathered with neighbors near the entrance at Forest and Rye Beach Avenue, sipping hot chocolate and singing with friends in the glow of a magical tree.", "In a balance of respect for history and openness to change, our little park along the beach has survived, and thrived, for more than 100 years.", "And Yes, I tell my eighteen-year-old self, this is not a bad place to grow up.", "Rye’s Waterfront Parks: Rye Town Park, Playland and their Neighborhoods, Walking Tour by Eugene McGuire", "Original sources from the Rye Historical Society Archives", "For additional information, please contact us at ryehistory.org"]}

In the United States, the wealthiest nation in the world, the rollout of PrEP has been nothing short of an abysmal failure.", "Black people make up approximately 13% of the total U.S population, and about 44% of HIV diagnoses annually.1", "And despite this disparity, we are also among the smallest population of people who are prescribed PrEP.", "According to a 2019 CDC analysis, only 11.2% of all PrEP users in the U.S. were Black.2 And while more than 50% of HIV diagnoses occur in the Southern states (which is still where most Black people in America live), most of the Southern states (except for Louisiana and Arkansas) have not expanded Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act.", "A 2020 study found that states that had expanded Medicaid and had a PrEP Access Program in the state had a 99% higher PrEP use than states that had neither, leaving many of the Southern states with large Black populations and large HIV prevalence rates with low access to PrEP and corresponding low usage.3", "While many people place the blame of low PrEP use on the lack of knowledge, interest or initiative of the consumer, far less work has been done to assess the impact of the list price of the medication on the ability of users to access PrEP as well as stay on PrEP.", "Debates about drug pricing often come down to the amount a patient has to pay out of pocket when they fill a prescription.", "But high drug list prices for antiretroviral medications, including those used for prevention, still impact access to these drugs downstream, even when the patient has low or no out-of-pocket costs.", "And while patient assistance programs can help cover some of those out-of-pocket costs for people who are not insured or cannot afford the prescription co-pays, they have not been enough to increase equitable access.", "The high list prices of the initial brand name drugs for PrEP have dictated PrEP delivery systems in the U.S., including how PrEP was marketed, clinical guidelines to determine PrEP eligibility, and prior authorization requirements from payers.", "The list price of PrEP medication and its impact on the ability to scale up use to have public health benefit was described in research literature as early as 2008, four years before the drug was approved.", "A study published that year assessed the cost effectiveness of implementing a PrEP program targeting men who have sex with men in New York City.", "The model to determine cost-effectiveness used the 2007 wholesale list price of TDF/FTC, which the authors note was $31USD per pill, making the monthly supply $930USD.4 A 2011 analysis from AIDS found that the $13,416 wholesale list price of Truvada would undermine the cost effectiveness of PrEP implementation in the United States.5 And in 2012, Philpott noted the “use of antiretroviral drugs for HIV prevention can be an effective public health intervention if and only if (1) the drugs are made widely available to those at highest risk; (2) the drugs are used consistently; (3) the drugs are provided as part of a comprehensive counseling program, including frequent follow-up testing; and (4) widespread risk compensation (e.g., decreased condom use or increased numbers of sexual partners) does not occur.”6", "These four criteria for PrEP scale up have all been threatened because of the high list price of the medications.", "On May 16, 2019, Gilead Sciences CEO Daniel O’ Day testified in front of Congress on the pharmaceutical company’s reasoning for keeping the price of TDF/FTC at approximately $1800 for a 30-day supply.", "O’Day offered that despite the high cost of the medication, it did not impede access, stating, “We offer a wide range of programs to help ensure that people have access to Truvada when they need it.", "For example, 98% of people who use our copay Assistance Program have no out-of-pocket costs. In fact, according to the CDC’s own estimates when taking our programs into account, less than 1% of Americans who would benefit from PrEP are in need of financial assistance to obtain Truvada.7 Furthermore, O’Day contradicts his own testimony about the impact of the price of Truvada on patients when his written testimony also stated a major barrier to PrEP access is “Insurance benefit design that places a significant cost-sharing burden on patients.”", "In other words, according to O’Day, the price set by Gilead Sciences for PrEP is not the problem. The problem is the insurers’ cost mitigation efforts, like higher copays and out of pocket expenses for PrEP users.", "But the issue that causes the policies of insurance companies still boils down to cost, and it is the public that pays in the end.", "The idea that the public, who invested heavily in the development of TDF/FTC for both treatment and prevention through studies funded by the National Institutes of Health, is made whole through Gilead’s patient assistance programs, is unfounded.", "In order to be eligible, a patient must have a prescription, proof of income, proof of residency, be uninsured, and make no more than 500% of the federal poverty level (approx.", "$70k). If a patient applies through Gilead’s Advancing Access website, conditional approval for 30 days is usually instant (sometimes there’s a delay or denial if income or insurance status recently changed).", "If denied, a patient can fax a paper application (4 pages with supporting documents such as a month’s worth of pay stubs or insurance termination letter), in which approval is usually 48 hours or less.", "If a PrEP patient has Advancing Access but does not renew within 12 months of the designated expiration date, the patient is not eligible to apply online and, instead, must submit a paper application.", "In essence, poor and working class PrEP users who depend on Gilead’s program are made to jump through more administrative hoops to access PrEP, which may play a role in the abysmal use rates.", "Also, PrEP users are at the mercy of their providers or PrEP navigators to either alert them to these options and help them fill out the paperwork for approval.", "If a patient is not made aware of this program, then they may just not pick up the prescription.", "In addition to manufacturer assistance programs being a woefully insufficient and inefficient way to ensure access, very little attention has been paid to the ways in which the high list price of Gilead’s two brand name drugs approved for PrEP impacts payer policy, public health social marketing and education programs, and even clinical guidelines.", "Until the list price of generic TDF/FTC fell in early 2021, PrEP users on most private insurance plans were still required to go through prior authorization every month to get the prescription, which created administrative burden both on the provider and the patient.", "Often, prior authorization is used by insurers when there is more than one drug option, as a way to ensure that providers are giving a clinical reason for a patient needing a more expensive drug when a cheaper, equally effective option is available.", "And yet, for many years when TDF/FTC was the only option, patients were still forced to go through variable and arbitrary prior authorization process, with clinicians being required to document HIV risk or other clinical criteria for PrEP use.", "Many patients were also required to use mail order specialty pharmacies to access PrEP, which may not be the most convenient option for people living in places where they don’t want a medication to be mailed to their home for privacy reasons (e.g., students in campus housing or living at home with parents, etc.).", "Ultimately the high list price of the drug incentivized insurers to more tightly and narrowly restrict access as a cost containment mechanism.", "When PrEP was first being implemented, much of the focus of public health programs in major U.S. cities was to create social marketing and community education programs focused almost exclusively on promoting PrEP to gay and bisexual men.", "While gay and bisexual men, and other men who have sex with men, make up the majority of new diagnoses in the U.S., they are not the only people who are vulnerable to HIV infection.", "Cisgender women account for about 20% of HIV diagnoses in the U.S. but only make up 7% of PrEP users.8 To be sure, public health programs also prioritized targeted marketing and education programs for men who have sex with men due to the vastly higher prevalence rates among this population.", "But one question that should be explored by historians, bioethicists, and other social scientists is whether the decision to nearly exclusively market PrEP to gay and bisexual men (until there was pushback from cisgender women and transgender activists) was at least in part due to the cost of the medication itself.", "Or were the very complicated sexual risk assessments in the early clinical guidelines that made it so that many Black and Brown men and women were missed as not having enough risk factors was either consciously or unconsciously written knowing a broader population of PrEP users would stretch already grossly underfunded city, county and state HIV/STD public health programs.9", "Drug pricing has become a major issue in American politics, with Americans across the political spectrum and every walk of life agreeing that Congress should do more to control for the cost of health care and all medications.", "And as we reach the 10th anniversary of the approval of the first drug approved for PrEP, manufacturer assistance and donation programs are not a panacea for the system that has kept the cost of the medication absurdly high.", "Many studies have concluded that the disproportionately higher HIV incidence among Black communities in the U.S. does not correlate with higher incidence of sexual or drug use risk behaviors.10 Instead, higher incidence of HIV among racial and ethnic minorities with less access to adequate healthcare has created conditions where more people with HIV do not know their status and are not virally suppressed.", "Because the first clinical guidelines for PrEP eligibility were written for providers to take individual risk assessments, many Black and Brown women and men who have sex with men would not meet the bar for individual risk, while their risk for HIV acquisition based on community level viral load and other factors, greatly increased their risk.", "Luckily, several structural changes recently have helped turn the tide on some of these upstream structural barriers to PrEP access.", "The U.S. Services and Preventative Task Force A grade rating for PrEP in 201911 helped reduce or eliminate cost sharing for PrEP.", "In 2021 as generic TDF/FTC became more widely manufactured and reduced the price of a 30-day supply from $1800 for brand name PrEP down to $40 for a generic, many of these restrictive payer and clinical guideline policies have been removed.", "With generic TDF/FTC now widely available at such a low cost, pharmacies have begun allowing patients to take home a 90-day supply.", "More and more marketing and education campaigns are reaching cisgender women and transgender people. And the CDC in late 2021 relaxed its clinical guidelines for providers, essentially allowing PrEP to be prescribed to any sexually active adult who is HIV negative.12", "Drug pricing has become a major issue in American politics, with Americans across the political spectrum and every walk of life agreeing that Congress should do more to control for the cost of health care and all medications.", "And as we reach the 10th anniversary of the approval of the first drug approved for PrEP, manufacturer assistance and donation programs are not a panacea for the system that has kept the cost of the medication absurdly high.", "To suggest that the only solutions to high drug costs is to help cover the out-of-pocket cost of medications is short sighted at best, for it does nothing to address the ways in which drug price impacts the very health care system that patients access downstream — from prior authorization to whom a particular intervention is marketed to and how restrictive clinical guidelines are written.", "The community of PrEP users, activists, and providers must come together to push for changes in our ability to control prices for medications.", "Any plan to end the epidemic will fail without public policy reforms on drug pricing to adequately address the upstream the cost of PrEP medications, because the high retail price limits what public health and health care systems can do to increase utilization downstream.", "Kenyon Farrow is an HIV prevention advocate and writer in Cleveland Heights, Ohio, USA.

Her death from cardiac arrest due to pneumonia was announced by her manager.", "Among the many so-called \"canaries\"—the female vocalists who sang for big bands during the Swing Era of the late 1930s and early 1940s—O'Day stood out for her hipness, musicianship, phrasing and sultry passion.", "With her trademark \"one of the boys\" attitude, O'Day typically wore a band jacket matching the uniforms of the instrumentalists over a plain blouse and skirt rather than the sort of the glamorous gowns favored by other female vocalists.", "Whatever might have been lacking in her dress and natural beauty, however, O'Day more than compensated with the brash sexuality and swagger that permeated her performances.", "Born in Chicago, O'Day spent her teenage years hustling on the walkathon circuit, a masochistic endurance entertainment popular during the 1930s.", "She changed her surname from Colton to O'Day, she was fond of saying, \"because in pig Latin it meant dough, which was what I hoped to make.\"", "O'Day catapulted to fame in 1941 when Gene Krupa, the flashy drummer for the popular Benny Goodman Orchestra, hired her to front his own big band.", "In an extremely bold move for the time, Krupa integrated his otherwise all-white band with Roy \"Little Jazz\" Eldridge, among the best Swing Era trumpeters, and paired him with O'Day in a suggestive interracial duet on \"Let Me Off Uptown.\"", "After her spirited vocal, Eldridge sings \"Anita, Anita ...

She lacked vibrato because of a botched tonsillectomy.", "She could, however, sculpt lovely lines of rapid-fire syllables, bending and tweaking the lyric and melody in surprising yet pleasant and logical ways.", "The words seemed compressed into a miasmic stream of undulating sound, while the lyric still came through.", "Although her pitch sometimes wandered, her sense of swing was impeccable. O'Day would not so much sing a song as disassemble it, only to reconstitute the composition in a manner that released deeper and more profound emotions than the original.", "\"When you haven't got that much voice, you have to use all the cracks and the crevices and the black and the white keys,\" O'Day once told an interviewer.", "\"That's all the range I've got. I'm no Lily Pons or Sarah Vaughan.\"", "An excellent example of her unique style appears in Jazz on a Summer's Day, Bert Sterns' documentary on the 1958 Newport Jazz Festival.", "With the camera focused close-up on her face poking out from an oversized, floppy, feathery black-and-white hat, an obviously stoned O'Day sensually squeezed out a completely unorthodox, yet beautifully languid \"Sweet Georgia Brown.\"", "Despite failing health, O'Day continued to perform in Los Angeles-area venues until a few years ago. Her last album, ironically titled \"Indestructible!\" was completed on her 86th birthday and released just last April.", "While one might admire her spirit, these later performances are excruciatingly bad, and highly embarrassing.", "Retirement would have made more sense in this case.", "The passing of O'Day is another reminder of the great epoch of jazz and the classic American popular song that both blossomed and withered during the 20th century."]}

Due to shifts in availability of herring in certain areas and increased bycatch of the massive Georges Bank haddock stock, the mid-water trawl fleet has frequented fishing grounds close to Cape Cod in recent years.", "Conflicts between the mid-water trawl fleet and other users in this region came to a head during the development of Amendment 8.", "Proposals for gear bans, area restrictions, and seasonal fishery closures were debated over the course of two years, along with the potential socioeconomic impacts to the herring fleet and benefits to other users, including the commercial groundfish fishery, recreational striped bass and tuna fisheries, and whale watch industry.", "Throughout the public process, which included scoping meetings, public hearings, and several NEFMC meetings of the Herring Industry Advisory Panel and Oversight Committee, additional concerns about river herring bycatch, ecosystem and habitat degradation, and the herring resource itself were raised, resulting in proposals to ban the gear in nearshore areas along the entire coast.", "In the spring of 2018, while the buffer zone debate continued, a new benchmark stock assessment for herring was conducted by the Northeast Fisheries Science Center.", "The assessment results showed a drastic change in stock size and productivity.

Our anglers release about 93% of all the striped bass they catch.", "Discards in the commercial striped bass fishery, though difficult to quantify, are also believed to make up a significant share of the catch, especially given the larger minimum size for that fishery.", "Studies have shown that about 9% of released striped bass will die from the effects of hooking and handling (called release mortality).", "Given that recent stock assessments have shown that fishing mortality is increasing, we think it is time to institute some broad-based and effective measures to lower the mortality rate and ensure the future health of the striped bass stock.", "We have heard from many anglers that feel a no-gaffing rule in the striped bass fishery is a no-brainer.", "Using a gaff to assist in bringing your catch aboard causes significant injury to the fish and there is often no way to tell the precise length of this fish until it is removed from the water.", "Given that our fisheries release large numbers of striped bass that are just below the legal size limit, we feel it is irresponsible to continue to allow the practice.", "Numerous other Atlantic coast states have already implemented such a provision in their striped bass fisheries, including Maine, New Hampshire, Connecticut, Maryland, and Virginia.", "The mandatory use of in-line circle hooks is the single most effective way to decrease mortality in striped bass.", "There are many studies that demonstrate the efficacy of circle hooks in lowering release mortality in striped bass and other species.", "Deep hooking (i.e., when the hook catches in the esophagus or gills rather than the lip) is the major contributor to release mortality.", "It has been demonstrated that the use of circle hooks, as compared to j hooks, greatly reduces the incidence of deep hooking and therefore mortality.", "The latest catch estimate from the revised Marine Recreational Information Program (see page 7) indicates that Massachusetts recreational anglers released almost 13 million striped bass in 2017.", "If we apply the release mortality rate of 9%, that means over 1 million striped bass died after being released.", "That’s compared to only 300,000 that were taken home and eaten! Clearly the mortality resulting from fishing in Massachusetts can have an effect on the striped bass population.", "That’s why DMF is proposing the mandatory use of circle hooks for anglers using certain natural baits.", "A study in Maryland found a 90% reduction in mortality when using in-line circle hooks. Imagine if we could reduce the number of release deaths from over a million fish to 100,000!", "DMF will be bringing the proposal to implement these two conservation regulations to public hearing this winter.", "We seek the public’s input on certain aspects of how the regulations will apply. For instance, should the gaffing and circle hook rules apply to the recreational, for-hire, and commercial sectors universally or should some groups be exempt; should artificial lures with bait (e.g., tube and worm) be included?", "We hope to see you at the public hearings and let us know your opinion.", "For too long, low fines were considered the “cost of doing business” for poachers of marine fish and shellfish resources.", "In response to longstanding and urgent demands from fishermen and Environmental Police, DMF led an initiative to overhaul state laws to increase the fines and penalties associated with violations of marine fisheries rules.", "This past summer, the Legislature included in the Environmental Bond Bill a substantial re-write of state laws to address the problem of outdated and insignificant fines.", "Governor Baker signed the legislation in August and the new laws took effect on November 7, 2018.", "Under Massachusetts law, fines and penalties are set in law and require legislative and gubernatorial approval for any changes.", "Almost two years ago, DMF convened a committee, which included members of its Marine Fisheries Advisory Commission and leadership of the MA Environmental Police, to identify the problems with outdated statutes levying fines and make recommendations to the Legislature.", "It’s a complicated task to amend 42 sections of state law, but DMF received strong legal support from staff at the Department of Fish and Game, Executive Office of Energy and Environmental Affairs, and the Governor’s office.", "Once the proposals for change were drafted, DMF received stakeholder input and support from commercial fishermen’s organizations, municipal shellfish officials, and recreational fishing groups.", "When citing a person for a marine fisheries violation, an Environmental Police Officer (EPO) can use discretion to charge the individual with non-criminal (civil) or criminal charges.", "EPOs rely heavily on non-criminal penalties as an enforcement tool for minor violations because courts are often not supportive of criminal prosecution/conviction of fishermen for low level violations.", "However, the consensus among the Environmental Police was that the low level of fines set by law was not a sufficient deterrent to discourage law-breakers.", "The experience and guidance of the EPOs was invaluable to achieve the right balance in establishing new fines.", "For example, the EPOs advised us not to set the fines so high that some courts might waive the fines upon appeal.", "As a result of the new laws, the new fine schedule for non-criminal tickets has been doubled. Previously, the fines were scaled at $50, $100 and $200 depending on the violation; these fines are now $100, $200 and $400.", "On top of the base fine, officers may now also issue a $10 fine per non-compliant fish. The additional $10 fine applies to all regulated marine fish species except for bivalve shellfish (clams).", "This per-fish fine will be especially effective for some of the high profile cases where large numbers of illegally harvested black sea bass, tautog, and whelk have been discovered.", "These additional fines will add up quickly and serve as a deterrent for poaching.", "On the criminal side, many of the old laws established specific fines for each section of law and were so outdated to be considered quaint—or laughable depending on your perspective.", "The penalties reflect attitudes, conservation priorities and currency values of the time period when they were enacted.", "For example the criminal fine for poaching river herring (last amended about a century ago) was just $5 to $50!", "Many sections of law written over the last century had different criminal fines, and this needed to be streamlined and stiffened.", "Now, nearly all criminal violations will result in a consistent $400 to $10,000 fine and up to 2 ½ years in jail.", "Longstanding criminal fines specific to lobster and shellfish were unchanged because they are recently enacted and sufficiently strong to deter poaching.", "For example, lobster violations carry stiff fines per lobster: egg-bearing female lobsters at $150–$500 each; short lobsters at $100–$500 each; and removing eggs from a lobster at $250–$500 each.", "These per-lobster fines help make the lobster industry highly compliant.", "Another creation of the new law is the authority for the Commonwealth to assess a civil penalty of up to $10,000 for marine fisheries violations.", "This new enforcement tool will be reserved for the most egregious violations that the Attorney General may decide does not warrant criminal prosecution but does require a more substantial economic penalty than that provided by a non-criminal citation.", "Such cases would be prosecuted by the Attorney General’s office on behalf of DMF or the Environmental Police.", "Finally, like a good, old-fashioned attic cleanup, some sections of Chapter 130 that were no longer needed have been eliminated.", "These include a requirement to label all containers of sea scallop meats as “sea scallops” (Section 92); a prohibition on transporting fish out of state (Section 99); and a requirement to kill all starfish, “cockles,” and “winkles” by placing them above the high water mark (Section 103).", "This last law was particularly awkward in modern times given the commercial whelk fishery is now worth millions annually.", "A multitude of thanks go all around for the completion of this important update: to all who contributed on the committee including the leadership of the Environmental Police, to the Marine Fisheries Advisory Commission for their support, to the legal staff for their detailed review and edits, to the Legislature and Governor.", "By Daniel McKiernan, Deputy Director and Jared Silva, Fisheries Analyst", "The summer of 2018 was marked by a number of unusual events in our marine environment, some good and some troubling.", "Though the ocean is a dynamic setting in which change is expected, here are a few of the happenings that caught DMF’s eye.", "Striped bass & bluefish quotas not reached. For the first time in decades, a substantial portion (~11%) of the striped bass quota was left uncaught.", "Of the 847,585 lb commercial quota for Massachusetts, landings tallied about 753,000 lb. Anecdotal reports from commercial anglers reveal fewer schools of commercial-sized bass were available within Massachusetts waters this past summer.", "The Massachusetts commercial fishery is constrained by a higher size limit (34”) than that of the recreational fishery (28”), just two open fishing days per week (Monday & Thursday), a commercial season that opens on June 23, and strictly enforced daily limits of 15 fish for boat-based fishing and 2 per angler for shore-based harvest.", "Environmental police have been diligent about inspecting commercial anglers’ catches. The shortfall in bass landings was similar to that seen in the bluefish fishery of which only 40% of the 486,539 lb quota was landed.", "Commercial quota shortfalls were seen in all states throughout the range suggesting a stock-wide downturn for bluefish.", "Juvenile tropical species abundant north of Cape Cod. The late summer and early fall of 2018 brought a healthy number of adult Atlantic bonito to their normal haunts in Nantucket Sound, Vineyard Sound, and Buzzards Bay.", "Fishing guides and recreational anglers alike enjoyed seeing these tasty speedsters in numbers not witnessed this great in over a decade.", "Most of these fish were in the 2–8 pound range considered typical in these waters. Perhaps more intriguing was the arrival of hordes of juvenile Atlantic bonito that showed up in Cape Cod Bay and Massachusetts Bay in mid-August.", "Even though Atlantic bonito have been recorded as far north as Nova Scotia, anglers rarely encounter these young fish north of Cape Cod.", "From late August until the end of September DMF received numerous reports of small bonito being caught by anglers targeting Atlantic mackerel at the East end of the Cape Cod Canal, outside Boston Harbor, and around Gloucester.", "And not just a few fish; we received calls from people reporting catching them by the bucket full! We even received a report from the Piscataqua River (between Maine and New Hampshire) of one of these young-of-the -year bonito!", "The unexpected presence of these young fish North of Cape Cod may be a result of warming New England waters.", "Abundant menhaden (pogies) attract feeding whales nearshore and succumb to summer temperatures. In late August, there were press reports of a handful of humpback whales inside Boston Harbor feeding on menhaden—a rich forage species and one of their favorite prey.", "These whales were visible from shore and mariners were warned to be on the lookout in the busy harbor.", "Menhaden often aggregate in dense schools in harbors and other embayments and many predators (e.g., striped bass, tuna) capitalize on these feeding opportunities.", "These scenarios are ideal for small boat anglers who then fish close to home. Such predation, as well as the summer’s heat, likely contributed to a menhaden die-off that occurred within the Mystic River along Everett and Somerville in mid-July.", "DMF was called upon to assess the probable cause of the mortality event, estimated to number in the tens of thousands of fish, which created an unsightly and smelly attraction for local residents and businesses along the river’s banks.", "These fish kills can and do happen throughout the menhaden’s range along the Atlantic coast when large schools of fish enter tight embayments, often chased there by predators, and deplete the water’s dissolved oxygen content and consequently suffocate.", "Long stretches of cloudy, hot weather can also contribute to lowered oxygen levels. This natural event, while unpleasant, was another indication of high menhaden abundance re-establishing itself north of Cape Cod, and one reason why DMF supports the maintenance of a commercial menhaden fishery in Massachusetts capable of taking the state’s share of the coastwide quota.", "Menhaden fish kills have not been common in Massachusetts since the last population boom in the 1980s; the 2018 event may be a harbinger of things to come.", "Atlantic surf clams die-off. DMF also received word of clams having washed up on Revere Beach in mid-July.", "A search of the area revealed millions of Atlantic surf clams left high and dry on the sand, encompassing an area over 8 acres.", "Many of the clams were already dead, causing a nuisance smell for beachgoers; however, a good portion were still alive and many were actively reburying.", "A similar event with comparable numbers of juvenile surf clams was reported at Long Beach in Nahant. Subsequent reports of washed up clams occurred at the end of August and again in mid September.", "Events like this, while rare, are not unknown. Mass die-offs have occurred at other Massachusetts beaches and in other Atlantic states.", "Because these clams were found in varying states of distress and decomposition, it is presumed that this was a prolonged event and not necessarily due to one particular cause.", "High water temperature and associated low levels of dissolved oxygen may have contributed by causing physiological stress to the surf clam, resulting in impacts to metabolism, filtration rates, and immune functions.", "Pathology studies showed no evidence of common parasites, although analysis of the digestive organs revealed a high number of unidentified algal cells which may have been an additional stressor potentially clogging the clams’ gills which are important for both feeding and respiration.", "While an abundance of a species of Vibrio bacteria was also observed, it cannot be assumed a bacterial infection was the causative agent of the mass die-off, and not a secondary effect due to other environmental stressors like high temperature.", "More than likely, it was a combination of factors that led to this large scale die-off.", "Mysterious whale deaths. Unfortunately, more marine mortality events occurred this summer when a handful of large whales were also found dead in Massachusetts coastal waters.", "Two dead humpback whales washed ashore in September in the Mass Bay area, although no cause of death could be determined.", "Earlier in the year, two other dead humpback whales were seen floating offshore. Additionally two fin whales washed ashore dead in Cape Cod Bay, one in August and one in October.", "No cause of death was determined in those cases either. The humpback whale deaths are part of an ongoing Unusual Mortality Event (UME) for that species that started back in 2016.", "A UME is a designation under the federal Marine Mammal Protection Act which defines a significant die-off of any marine mammal population and demands an immediate investigation.", "It is important to determine the causes of UMEs and their effect on the population involved, as well as give insight into environmental causes that might have human health impacts.", "Many of the humpbacks appear to have been killed by collisions with boats.
