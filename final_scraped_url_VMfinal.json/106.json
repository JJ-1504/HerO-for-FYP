Alteryx also made a major product announcement on May 11th and has recently posted some very interesting new job openings.", "There is a lot to unpack here and I will try to cover all the new activity, in addition to the earnings report.", "Then, we can look at what this means for the investment thesis going forward.", "Before I jump into reviewing the financial results and other announcements, I wanted to give my perspective on a couple of items that could be sources of confusion for investors, relative to the Alteryx product offering and its pricing structure.", "Granted, perception can be reality, but some explanation might help investors understand the landscape and draw their own conclusions.", "More importantly, we have some hints of future technology architecture direction, which further mitigate possible concerns and could open up new audiences to the Alteryx product offering.", "I have heard some commentary relative to the Alteryx offering that it might be hindered because the software is deployed “on-premise” and is not cloud-based.", "At a high level, investors know that cloud migration generally involves replacing legacy software packages that are deployed on local corporate networks (on-prem) with software that is run on servers hosted remotely with cloud vendors (cloud).", "Additionally, we have the concept of SaaS, in which the vendor runs the software for the customer from a central location.", "Alteryx’s offering falls somewhere in between these currently, with indications that they are evolving quickly.", "Putting aside terms like cloud-based or SaaS, I think the best way for investors to understand Alteryx’s software architecture and distribution model is by considering these elements:", "- Client. The software that runs on the user’s local machine (desktop, laptop, tablet, mobile phone, etc.)", "- Server. The centralized software system to which the clients connect to exchange data, kick off background jobs and interface with other systems.", "- Software Distribution Model. The way that software updates are distributed and applied to both the client and server.", "- Pricing Structure. The way that a customer is charged for licenses to use the product.", "Most software clients can either run as a native application that is installed on the user’s operating system directly or runs within a web browser.", "The user’s machine in this context can either be their desktop/laptop, a tablet or a mobile phone. Applications running natively have inherent advantages over browser-based clients.", "The code is compiled, so it runs faster. Native apps can control the UI more precisely, can get more resources (CPU, memory) from the machine and aren’t confined to the browser’s runtime sandbox (for security reasons).", "The downside to running a native application is that software updates have to be triggered by the user.", "In a browser app, the user just hits “refresh” to get a new version. In a native app, they have to kick off an installation process.", "However, native app installs can be pretty seamless these days. Assuming users can connect to a central app distribution store, like the way the Apple App Store works or the company’s own web site, then updates are pretty easy to manage.", "Some software companies make their clients available as both a web client and a native client. Slack is a good example.", "I can run Slack in a web browser, or I can download the Slack app onto my Mac and run it natively. As an active user of Slack, the native client is much better.", "The UI is tighter and much more responsive than the browser version. Also, the app allows me to toggle between multiple workspaces at once, get desktop notifications and launch the experience quickly from my dock.", "Accessing documents from my local machine to share is easier.", "Another client application model to consider is how we run software on our mobile devices. I can either use a software service through a browser on my iPhone (mobile web) or I can download that company’s app from the App Store (native app).", "Generally, the native app performs much better for the same reasons as on a desktop. It can access system resources directly (camera, touchscreen, location, etc.), can paint the screen on a per pixel level and will run faster because the app is compiled code.", "Of course, accessing a company’s web application through a browser is usually the initial touch point, as the user doesn’t have to go download an app on the first encounter.", "So, it is critical that a software provider also have a web experience that supports basic functionality.", "Eventually, heavy users do go download the app, as it’s easier for repeat use (think eTrade or Twitter).", "In the case of Alteryx, the client software is the Designer product. It runs as a native application on the user’s machine.", "The software can be downloaded from the Alteryx web site, much like how other companies distribute a native client.", "The Designer application is currently only available for the Windows OS, specifically MS Windows 7 or later.", "The user’s machine needs to be fairly powerful to run the software, with at least a quad core CPU, 500GB-1TB of disk space and 8-16 GB RAM.", "For this, the user would need a decent laptop or desktop machine. You couldn’t run this on a mobile device, but I don’t think a data analyst is going to perform heavy data prep, blending and machine learning tasks on their phone.", "On the surface, the limitation to only running on Windows OS might be considered a knock. Slack runs on both Windows and Mac natively.", "However, I think this is okay. Alteryx users, at least for now, are going to be power users. This would presumably be the primary tool they use daily.", "So, needing to provision a Windows machine to do their job is a reasonable assumption. Also, it is fairly easy to run the Windows OS on a Mac through a dual-boot tool, like Boot Camp.", "Given these circumstances, I actually prefer that Alteryx focus its developer resources on the Windows-only client.", "If they tried to roll a native Mac client, they would have to effectively double the dev resources for the Designer team.", "Mac apps are built in another language framework with different OS APIs.", "Alteryx Designer is necessarily a fat, native client application. This has a couple of benefits, in my view.", "First, due to the type of workload, I think a native client provides much better performance. The Designer client can support active data connections to various data sources, both local to the machine (load a csv) or remote (connect to another SaaS or database).", "Large datasets can make full use of the machine’s local memory and disk. This would not be feasible in the memory space of a browser and sophisticated data manipulation would much more difficult using interpreted Javascript data structures.", "Second, because Designer is a fat client, it can be run independent of a server. In fact, many enterprises start with just Designer licenses.", "By running independent of the server, it also doesn’t require a network connection back to the server to be useful.", "Think about it like Excel. Many data analysts today still run Excel natively on their desktop because they have large datasets and create complex logic in macros.", "They can import data from external sources through connectors. As data is updated, it can be processed locally into different views, pivot tables, etc.", "With all that said, Alteryx management has discussed the idea of creating a browser-based version of Designer.", "The CEO just mentioned this at a recent analyst conference and the CFO discussed this further in an interview with TheStreet.", "It sounds like large enterprise customers are asking about the feasibility of a browser-based version of Designer in order to facilitate distribution of clients to a large number of users.", "Thick client on a desktop is much harder to manage than just simply entitling a user and having them go to a browser.", "We did show a prototype version of that at our conference last year. That’s kind of the direction we’re going.", "But really, the focus is on, how do we help our largest clients massively deploy Designers through a browser rather than a thick client install.", "Alteryx CFO, INterview with theStreet, May 12, 2020", "So, it appears that Alteryx is already moving in the direction of making a browser-run version of their Designer application.", "My assumption is that this would be stripped of some features, in order to be performant, and offered on a different licensing arrangement than full-featured Designer.", "Call it Designer Light (Update – It seems this will be called Designer Express, based on a product manager job posting from yesterday.", "What really caught my eye, though, is the comment around “massively” deploying Designers. Given Alteryx’s new motion to empower every employee at an enterprise to be a data worker, this might represent a way to dramatically expand the organizational reach of the Alteryx platform, beyond just the power user data analysts, and generate more client license revenue.", "The server side of the software model provides something for the client to connect to. For thin clients, like those that are browser-based, the server handles most of the heavy processing work.", "The browser really just renders the UI, while the server processes every user action, controls business logic and all data access.", "Without the server, the browser is pretty useless. For a fat, native client, the server tends to handle functions around sharing data with other clients and running jobs remotely to free up resources on the user’s machine.", "The server software can be run on a single, more powerful computer, or a cluster of machines that all run the same software and are stateless (SaaS architecture generally).", "In the stateless configuration, there is usually a database (or set of databases) that the servers share.", "For the case where the server software is installed onto a machine (the server), it is generally managed by the enterprise.", "This server machine can be located on the enterprise’s local network (on-prem), in a data center they manage (hybrid) or onto a machine provisioned by a cloud provider (self-managed cloud).", "In these cases, the enterprise controls the server machine, applies software updates, ensures security requirements meet standards, etc.", "For most SaaS offerings, like Slack, the vendor completely manages the server side of the model. There is no option for an enterprise to run the Slack server themselves (that I know of).", "In this case, the software provider handles all software updates, monitors performance and manages security controls.", "They also go to great lengths to isolate each customer’s data through federation, but at the end of the day, resources are shared.", "This might not work for the most security conscious organizations.", "To make matters more complicated, some software vendors offer support for both server management models.", "They allow the customer to either download the server software and host it themselves, or the customer can utilize the vendor’s server cloud and not have direct control over the servers.", "In Alteryx’s case, the Server product represents a downloadable software package that is installed onto a server machine that the enterprise manages.", "This can either be a server machine that sits on premise or on a rented machine in the cloud. In either case, it runs on Windows Server 2008R2 or later.", "The machine specs are heavier than for Designer, which we would expect. Virtual environment support is available for Nutanix, Azure, AWS, VMWare and GCP (basically the main cloud vendors and hybrid solutions).", "The requirement to run Windows Server on the server side isn’t really a concern. It is just as easy to provision a Windows host as a Linux one on most cloud providers.", "And this shouldn’t be viewed as a limitation, as SaaS vendors use both OS versions to run their centralized server software (although mostly Linux).", "It wouldn’t make sense for Alteryx to rebuild Server to run on Linux, at least for the self-managed version.", "Since the Designer client can operate autonomously, the Alteryx Server focuses more on collaboration features, offloading work and handling external requests.", "- Saves workflows and data models for other users to access.", "- Runs data processing jobs remotely, so that the user’s desktop resources aren’t consumed (although Designer can run the jobs too).", "- Handles scheduling of workflows as jobs that run with some periodicity. Admins can also manage the active queue of jobs and control priority.", "- Provides user access controls around workflows and shared data.", "- Supports some shared dashboard functionality for basic data visualization.", "- Hosts data connectors that can be shared among Designer users (keeps credentials stored centrally).", "- Can expose data sets as APIs that other applications can consume.", "- Can export data sets to other data visualization tools, like Tableau server.", "The big question is whether there would be advantages in having Alteryx run the Server product for enterprises, like what a SaaS company might do.", "Perhaps. The benefits would be to eliminate server management overhead for customers and speed up software updates.", "I don’t think there would be additional network effects, by being able to centrally view all customer activity (like what CRWD or OKTA does), but observing common behaviors might offer some insight for future product development.", "Regardless, the effort to centralize the Server offering into a parallel “Cloud” product, like what MongoDB, Microsoft and Elastic offer wouldn’t be very difficult.", "I would estimate that much of the existing Server software code could be re-purposed.", "This addresses how software updates are distributed and applied. I think we covered this in the discussion above about Client and Server.", "In Alteryx’s model, the customer is responsible for applying software updates. In a typical SaaS model, the vendor handles all software updates on the server side.", "If the client runs as a web application in a browser, the updates are automatic. If the client runs as a native app (like Slack app on desktop or mobile), the user has to update it.", "For Alteryx’s current distribution model, the customer handles the application of software updates to both the client and the server.", "Distributed software applications are usually licensed in a couple of ways. First, there is the traditional software license that applies a single fee to purchase a pinned version of the software.", "This is how big vendors like Microsoft and Adobe previously sold their software. The customer could purchase a single license for the software for a one-time fee and never pay again.", "If they wanted an update, they usually paid a smaller incremental fee for the newer version. With SaaS, the pricing model evolved to per user per month.", "This is how popular SaaS offerings, like Slack work. As SaaS became popular, the big packaged software vendors had to evolve quickly.", "They moved to a subscription model, in which the user pays a monthly fee. This fee gives them access to any version of the downloadable software, along with some sharing features on the server side.", "Microsoft did this with their Office 365 offering, as did Adobe with their Creative Cloud. For example, a user of Photoshop, which is a resource intensive native application for creating graphics, could download the Photoshop application and then get free updates as long as they paid the monthly fee.", "As part of the enterprise plan, they can also use some of the content sharing and collaboration features.", "The Alteryx pricing model is similar to Adobe’s enterprise offering, except that licenses are purchased on a per user/year basis.", "Currently, each Designer license is listed at $5,195 per user/year and Server costs $78,975 per year.", "On the Q4 and Q1 earnings calls, several sell-side analysts asked about the pricing of Alteryx products and the recent 35% increase in server costs.", "They seemed concerned about the list price of Alteryx products and whether that would impact sales going forward.", "I suppose it could on the surface, but product list price usually doesn’t coming into play in IT budgeting, at least in my experience.", "As a CTO and VP Engineering at several past organizations, I would generally review the IT budget with the CFO as a roll-up by line item on a quarterly or annual basis.", "Each software service, whether pure SaaS or per user license, would just be listed as a line in a spreadsheet with a total cost for that time period.", "We would then go through each line item and decide if the total cost was worth the value to the organization.", "In Alteryx’s case, a medium deployment of 20 Designer licenses and a Server license might cost $200k a year.", "If that was the primary tool used by the analytics team every day, the total cost might be just fine.", "Broadly deployed SaaS applications can quickly rack up costs as well for an organization with thousands of users.", "Okta, Office 365 or even Datadog could generate annual costs in excess of Alteryx for a large installation.", "Those might be justifiable as well. It is all evaluated through the lens of value created for the business.", "On the earnings call, the Alteryx leadership team mentioned closing a 7-figure deal with a European financial company in March.", "In this case, I imagine the global CIO or CDO simply looked at the total cost of the Alteryx solution in the context of the value it provided for the organization.", "That person probably wasn’t concerned what each license cost. Granted every organization will be managing costs in this COVID-19 impacted environment, but I don’t think the licensing model is the issue.", "Cost reductions are generally applied across the board, like to cut an organization’s IT budget by 20%.", "In that case, the result might be to give up or not renew a couple of Designer licenses, but I would apply the same approach to any other SaaS tool licensed on a per user per month basis.", "Also, the perceived flexibility of SaaS or subscriptions billing on a monthly basis versus annual license fees isn’t a benefit in reality.", "Most SaaS vendors will offer a discount for multi-year deals or minimum annual spend commitments, so enterprises get locked into a longer contract regardless.", "With all that said, subsequent comments at the Piper Sandler and J.P. Morgan analyst conferences lead me to believe that Alteryx is pursuing an expansion of their product portfolio and possibly different pricing models.", "The CEO teased a major platform release in June, an upcoming intelligent suite and a browser-based version of Designer.", "These could bring alternate pricing options for Server and Designer “light” that align with conventional SaaS models.", "Another source of clues about what Alteryx is planning from a product development point of view is to look at their recent job postings.", "I have noticed some significant changes in the last two weeks in the types of jobs posted, specifically for the technology team, that give clear insight into how Alteryx is evolving their tech stack and product architecture.", "A few of these jobs were just added yesterday, so this situation is evolving quickly.

The Express label makes me think this will be offered in addition to Designer “heavy”, which implies distribution to a broader audience of users and perhaps new revenue streams.", "Okay, that was a bit involved, but hopefully provided some useful context for investors.

So we believe we’re particularly well positioned for, not just the short-term but the medium-term and the long-term.", "This left investors wondering what he was referring to. On Monday, May 11, Alteryx announced its enhanced Analytic Process Automation platform (APA).", "The intent is to unify analytics, data science and business process automation into one platform. Alteryx contends that current analytics and data science work is addressed through a disparate set of point solutions.", "They want to provide a platform that allows data workers to prosecute the full spectrum of tasks in one system.", "Beyond the technology consolidation, their approach is also very people centric. It is positioned to make analytics and automation available to a broad audience, essentially any employee with a need to better understand their company’s data.", "Alteryx primarily sells into the data analyst teams within business units versus centralized IT. Part of Alteryx’s intention is to expand the user set, by making data processing tasks easier through their “code free” approach.", "This is bolstered by the theme of empowering citizen data scientists.", "The Alteryx APA platform provides an integrated solution that addresses all steps in the analytic process.", "It includes 260 automation building blocks that can be combined through a visual interface to create an analytic pipeline.", "These range from facilitating data import to cleansing, generating insights and exporting to external systems.", "- Automate data asset inputs. This allows data from many sources to be pulled into the pipeline for processing.", "The platform includes connectors for 80+ common data sources, like Salesforce, Oracle or MongoDB. These can be in the cloud, on-prem or even represent files on the user’s local machine like CSV, PDF, etc.", "- Data quality and preparation. Provides tools to cleanse, prepare, and blend the data.

This involves sharing the output and insights gained from the process. The sharing can be accomplished by writing back to a permanent data store, generating a spreadsheet or publishing a report.", "Once an automated process is built, it can be repeated to update the insight output on a scheduled basis.", "Also, APA supports lightweight dashboards for quick views, but is meant to export to more robust data visualization tools, like Tableau.", "ML/AI capabilities will be layered into the data processing flows and leverages Alteryx’s October 2019 acquisition of Feature Labs, a data science company launched out of MIT.", "Feature Labs brought capabilities around automating the creation of machine learning models with a focus on feature engineering.", "These tasks are normally handled through manual, error-prone processes that rely heavily on skilled data scientists.", "That acquisition also brought Alteryx some street-cred, as Feature Labs maintains a number of open source libraries for data scientists to automate feature engineering tasks.", "At time of acquisition, these open source libraries had been downloaded over 350,000 times and Alteryx plans to continue support for this work.", "The product offerings associated with APA appear to remain the same. They are still oriented around Designer, Server, Connect and Promote, along with optional add-ons for custom datasets.", "The pricing model hasn’t changed either. However, given the comments around product development pipeline and new job postings, I think we can expect this landscape to change and see new product offerings in the future.", "The APA launch is being supported by a media blitz, including coverage in Forbes, Gartner, Fast Company and Wired.", "Additionally Alteryx is hosting a kick-off event that will be live streamed on May 20th. Participants beyond Alteryx personnel will be the Chief Product Officer at PwC (Alteryx’s global elite partner), the Research Director of Analytics at IDC and the VP Decision Science at Coca-Cola.", "The implication is that Coca-Cola is already a heavy user of Alteryx APA. Also mentioned in the release is a new customer, the Al-Futtaim Group, an operator of over 160 franchise brands across retail, financial services, automotive and health across the Middle East and Asia.", "While most of this announcement appears to be around product positioning and marketing, Dean Stoecker (CEO) talked about a robust product roadmap this year at the JP Morgan Conference on May 12th.", "He said there would be more product innovation for Alteryx in the next 4 quarters than there has been in the last 10 years.", "He mentioned a few examples like a browser-based version of Designer and an Intelligent Suite. Another focus will be around ease of use towards applying advanced data science capabilities for users.", "These assertions are supported by the recent job postings mentioned above. In a recent interview of the CFO by TheStreet, the CFO also reinforced that M&A will continue to be part of their strategy to selectively pick up strong development teams and unique IP.", "I think APA represents a bold move for Alteryx. As Dean fairly references, past software companies have built large ecosystems around a new category.", "Some software industry veterans claim that the company that defines a new category can expect 75% of the share.", "Examples include ITSM (ServiceNow), SFA/CRM (Salesforce) and HRM (Workday). Alteryx has wisely pulled IDC into the mix, as industry analysts (IDC, Gartner, Forrester) are the ones who come up with the different categories of software in order to structure the landscape for their reports (Magic Quadrant, Wave, etc.).", "By being first to a category (because you defined it), will generally mean that you will also be in the top right position in the competitive landscape.", "Launching with PwC will further reinforce the APA category, as we can imagine PowerPoints to enterprise c-suite members including new references to “APA”, giving the impression that they will be missing out if they don’t allocate budget to this area.", "- I think Q1 was tracking towards more outperformance before COVID-19 hit. Leadership mentioned that they saw a significant slow down in March, which is also the third month of the quarter.", "I think Q2 estimates are likely conservative as activity in April would be low and not provide much insight into quarter close.", "With that said, some peers are still putting up great results (FSLY, TWLO, DDOG), so I don’t want to make too many assumptions.", "- My interpretation is that Alteryx’s traditional sales motion has been very tied to in-person interaction and the licensing model requires more overhead to get contracts completed.", "Reference the 7-figure European deal mentioned on the call that required many customer touchpoints to close.", "My sense is that the Alteryx sales team can adjust to this new motion. I don’t think it is a limitation in the product or value.", "- The challenge for Alteryx in projecting Q2 revenue, as compared to other SaaS businesses is that only 60-65% of their sales are ratable, versus 100% for other companies.", "For an average SaaS company with a contract duration of 2 years, they would have visibility of 85-90% of revenue for the subsequent quarter.", "Going into Q2, Alteryx can count on only 60-65%. Of the remainder, 15% is from contract renewals and the rest is generated by new business.", "Because almost 40% of Q2 revenue is in flux and Alteryx typically closes most of its business in June for Q2, it is reasonable that they took a conservative view for Q2 estimates.", "They did mention the word conservative several times on the call.", "And I think that the April performance is actually fairly strong. We’ve always been conservative even though we’ve seen some glimmers of hope in April.", "It turns out of the logos we brought-in in April 35% of them were actually in the highly impacted verticals, that’s also some silver lining in this.", "- I can appreciate the quandary that customer CIO/CTOs were in during the height of COVID-19 disruption in March/April.", "With the world shutting down, spend would rightfully focus towards “keep the lights on” IT areas and necessary support for transitioning to work from home.", "What is obvious is that this has favored hosting infrastructure (DDOG, FSLY, NET), identity/security (OKTA, CRWD), communications (TWLO) and remote collaboration (ZM, DOCU).", "For an analytics package, I can see that spend being put on hold in context. Not because it isn’t valuable to the analytics team, but because in the heat of the moment, I wouldn’t categorize it as mission critical.", "However, investors shouldn’t conflate mission critical with valuable. As enterprises have more visibility into the future and we slowly reverse the shut-down posture, then value-add solutions (that generate efficiencies, cost savings or revenue opportunities) like Alteryx should see spend return.", "- Putting aside COVID-19 impact, I was encouraged by other indicators of business performance that continued in Q1.", "Specifically, increasing customer count and G2K DBNER.", "- APA is very interesting. It is mostly a marketing move for now, but presumably will be followed by platform re-architecture, feature improvement and new product offerings.", "Establishing a category around APA should provide the market fit for the product. The bevy of new job postings around modern cloud architecture, APIs, lightweight clients and open source provide confidence for me that Alteryx won’t fall into the trap of becoming a legacy software offering.", "- Along these lines, Dean said something interesting towards the end of the call about renaming their annual user conference “Analyticon”.", "Alteryx is recognizing the convergence happening in the analytics and data science space. This aligns well with APA.", "They are going to open up their user conference to a much broader ecosystem, adding prospective customers and adjacent technology partners, such as H20 and Snowflake (which some analysts have categorized as competitors).", "They plan to bring all market participants into a single conference.", "- I think the primary risk for Alteryx going forward is around execution in Q2 and prolonged impact from COVID-19 on enterprise spend.", "Also, while Alteryx had great momentum through Q1, if buying behaviors somehow change or analytics investment is permanently de-prioritized, this would be a real problem for the investment thesis.", "- The pivot to APA is exciting, but will represent a lot of work. The new category definition may not take hold.", "The modern software development motion may take longer to execute or engineering culture may not shift quickly.", "This is a big bet that might take several quarters to play out.", "- The competitive landscape seems clear for now, but is always something to watch. Potential competitors might out-maneuver the APA initiative with categories of their own.", "It’s hard to encourage patience for investors, particularly when other COVID-19 beneficiaries (TWLO, FSLY, OKTA, DDOG, DOCU) are pushing to new highs.", "However, I feel that Alteryx has the potential to surprise investors later in the year and generate strong momentum going into 2021.", "This is based on positive execution in Q4 and through the first part of Q1. The new initiatives with APA and modernization of architecture should also broaden the customer landscape and reach within enterprises.", "These might drive new revenue streams layering on top of strong expansion rates for existing products.", "My general investment strategy skews towards looking forward 6-12 months and trying to anticipate where a company will be at that point, relative to valuation, product positioning and dynamics in the addressable market.", "For me, this means holding my position in AYX. Unless the COVID-19 situation gets much worse, I expect Alteryx to return to higher levels of growth going into 2021.", "This would provide a steep valuation ramp this time next year. The introduction of APA, with associated industry interest from PwC and IDC, should provide further tailwinds.", "In the earnings call, the CFO reiterated their long term margin targets, which should support high valuation assuming reasonable revenue growth returns.", "I understand if some investors will move over to other COVID-19 plays in the interim, while the thesis plays out.", "In the meantime, I am maintaining my long term price target for AYX of $325 by 2024 and will keep most of my existing position.", "I will shift a portion of my large AYX allocation in the near term to other stocks that recently outperformed (TWLO, FSLY) in order to balance out my positions.", "However, I will monitor AYX’s progress through this year and may add back as the situation becomes clearer going into 2021.", "In any case, I think AYX represents a solid choice for investors with a long-term horizon.", "Another outstanding piece of analysis. I agree with your decision to trim $AYX, as I did the same a few days back.", "My plan was to redeploy the funds into names like $LVGO, $ESTC, $DOCU, $CRWD, $MDB, $TWLO on pullbacks, but these names are refusing to pull back much at all.", "I see $ESTC and $CRWD as two names with upcoming earnings reports that have skyrocketed and may represent alpha opportunity.", "Excellent analysis! This is the first piece I read from your website and I am very impressed indeed. (I have subscribed to your newsletter half way through the article.)", "•The challenge for Alteryx in projecting Q2 revenue, as compared to other SaaS businesses is that only 60-65% of their sales are ratable, versus 100% for other companies.", "Are they not also offering yearly contracts for Designer and 2 to 3-year ones for Server as you mentioned?", "Hi – thanks for the feedback. Regarding that statement, when Alteryx closes a new sale, they realize 35-40% of the total contract value as revenue in that quarter.", "The remainder is split evenly amongst the other quarters for the contract duration. This revenue recognition rule was introduced when Alteryx moved to the new ASC 606 standard.", "This differs from other SaaS companies that split total contract value evenly across all quarters for revenue recognition.", "Because of this, Alteryx relies on new contract sales (renewals, expansions and greenfield) to drive a larger percentage recognized revenue each quarter than other SaaS companies.", "So, the recent slowdown in new buying behavior from customers has a magnified effect on Altery’s revenue streams.", "The flip side is that once spending returns, Alteryx will be able to realize a larger percentage of new contract value as revenue than peers.", "This is not a good or bad thing – it is just their interpretation of an accounting rule. But, should be understood by investors to evaluate revenue growth rates."]}

The growth is primarily due to a 1.5 GWdc announcement from Florida Power & Light and 1.1 GWdc announced by Duke Energy in the Carolinas.", "Florida Power & Light’s development of its own solar projects makes up the bulk of Florida’s five-year forecast, with additional announcements from Duke Florida, Teco Energy and Jacksonville Electric expected to add to the pipeline in that state.", "Voluntary procurement of utility PV based on its economic competitiveness continues to be the primary driver of projects announced in 2019.", "While many states, utilities and cities have announced or proposed 50% or 100% renewable energy or zero-carbon standards, the announcements have not yet resulted in an uptick in RPS-driven procurement.", "Corporate procurement of utility solar drove 22% of projects announced in 2018 and continues apace in 2019, with 14% of projects announced having a corporate offtaker.", "(Wood Mackenzie classifies large offsite projects with C&I offtakers as utility-scale rather than distributed due to the size and structure of the deals.)", "As the number of corporations pledging to use 100% renewable power continues to grow, corporate procurement is expected to remain a strong driver of utility PV.", "Despite steady installations in Q1 2019, the residential market is still highly reliant on legacy state markets, such as California and the Northeast, which have seen only modest to flat growth over the past several quarters.", "As these major state markets continue to grow past early-adopter consumers, higher costs of customer acquisition will challenge the industry to innovate product offerings and diversify geographically.", "Indeed, 29% of residential capacity in Q1 2019 came from markets outside the top 10 (by cumulative capacity), the highest share for emerging markets in industry history.", "From 2019-2021, residential growth will range from 5%-20% due to both emerging markets with strong resource fundamentals like Florida and Texas, and markets where recent policy developments have increased our near-term forecasts.", "Maryland’s recent renewable portfolio standard increase, the removal of South Carolina’s net metering cap, and new incentive programs such as Illinois’ Adjustable Block Program will provide significant upside and growth to our residential forecasts over the next few years.", "Meanwhile, California’s new home solar mandate will also help to offset market penetration challenges beginning in 2020.", "In the long term, the ITC step-down is expected to pull in demand in both legacy and emerging markets before declining in 2022.", "Growth resumes in 2023 and continues into 2024 based on economic fundamentals as the market adjusts to post-ITC market conditions.", "That said, long-term growth in a post-ITC world will be contingent on geographic diversification outside of legacy state markets and technological/business-model innovation to improve product offerings in solar-plus-storage.", "Non-residential installation totals in Q1 2019 were the weakest since Q1 2017 as all three major state markets (California, Massachusetts and Minnesota) saw declining volumes due to state-level policy reforms and interconnection delays that continue to limit development opportunities.", "Overall, the non-residential PV market is on track for another down year as the segment acclimates to a reduced incentive environment across major state markets.", "However, this will be incrementally offset starting in 2020 as the next wave of states with robust community solar mandates – New York, Maryland, Illinois and New Jersey – experience growth.", "Furthermore, recent policy developments in New York and Maryland will ultimately provide for growth in our long-term outlook.", "Significant revisions to the Value of Distributed Energy Resources (VDER) docket in New York have bolstered our long-term forecasts for both commercial and community solar, while an RPS increase in Maryland will boost the sagging SREC market to the benefit of the entire non-residential segment.", "Increasing solar-plus-storage viability will also begin to have an impact on non-residential demand as policymakers and business leaders increasingly consider energy storage in their decisions.", "New York’s recent development of the Bridge Incentive increases our long-term solar-plus-storage forecasts with further potential upside.", "By 2023, roughly 30% of total non-residential PV will come from community solar, and ~20% will come from solar-plus-storage projects.", "The U.S. utility solar forecast for 2019-2024 has grown by 5.1 GWdc since last quarter. The largest contributor is an increase to Florida’s five-year outlook from 6.0 GWdc to 9.0 GWdc due to new solar procurement by Florida Power & Light (FPL), Duke Energy Florida, and other Florida utilities (most of which is utility self-build).", "This positions Florida to be the top state for utility PV over the next six years.", "Since last quarter, the 2019 forecast has grown by 1.2 GW, due largely to late project announcements in Texas that raised the state’s forecast by 720 MWdc.", "While the forecast for 2020 saw little change to overall expected capacity additions, over 10.0 GWdc of utility PV are still expected to come online that year.", "From 2021-2023, our utility PV forecast has increased by 2.8 GWdc. While the bulk of this increase is found in Florida, there are a growing number of utilities such as Xcel Energy, Idaho Power and PacifiCorp, among others, announcing additional solar procurement, expedited coal plant retirement, or plans to achieve 50% to 100% renewable or carbon-free energy targets, all of which have boosted the midterm forecast.", "During this time, utility PV also becomes increasingly competitive with wind. As the wind-focused federal Production Tax Credit steps down, solar begins to fall below the cost of wind on a levelized cost of energy (LCOE) basis in many traditional wind states such as Illinois, Iowa, Kansas, Michigan and the Dakotas by the mid-2020s.", "(Wood Mackenzie’s LCOE calculations for solar take the ITC incentive into account.) This is likely not only to drive more solar procurement in wind-dominant regions of Midcontinent Independent System Operator and Southwest Power Pool, but also to make solar the preferred renewable technology for corporate offtakers.", "Oklahoma Gas & Electric’s recent RFP for solar-plus-storage is the first example of what is likely to be a trend in solar procurement in the Prairies and Midwest.", "Our 2024 forecast has also increased by 1.1 GWdc. Many utilities such as Dominion, Tennessee Valley Authority and FPL have outlined solar procurement plans for 2024 and beyond.", "Despite the ITC having fully stepped down to 10% by that time, utility PV will remain economically competitive with new-build wind and natural gas in many places.", "We employ a bottom-up modeling methodology to track and report national average PV system pricing for the major market segments.", "This methodology is based on tracked wholesale pricing of major solar components and data collected from interviews with major installers.", "In Q1 2019, system pricing fell in all market segments.

Many had hoped that the disastrous project was finally done for in November 2015, when the Obama administration vetoed the pipeline—acknowledging its pervasive threats to climate, ecosystems, drinking water sources, and public health.", "But immediately after taking office, President Donald Trump brought the zombie project back to life, along with the legal battles against it.", "By the time President Biden took office in 2021, ready to fulfill his campaign promise to revoke the cross-border permit, the dirty energy pipeline had become one of the foremost climate controversies of our time.", "Here’s everything you need to know about the historic KXL fight–and why the pipeline’s cancellation has had no impact on current oil prices.", "The Keystone XL pipeline extension, proposed by TC Energy (then TransCanada) in 2008, was initially designed to transport the planet’s dirtiest fossil fuel, tar sands oil, to market—and fast.", "As an expansion of the company’s existing Keystone Pipeline System, which has been operating since 2010 (and continues to send Canadian tar sands crude oil from Alberta to various processing hubs in the middle of the United States), the pipeline promised to dramatically increase capacity to process the 168 billion barrels of crude oil locked up under Canada’s boreal forest.", "It was expected to transport 830,000 barrels of Alberta tar sands oil per day to refineries on the Gulf Coast of Texas.", "From the refineries, the oil would be sent chiefly overseas—not to gasoline pumps in the United States.", "Some three million miles of oil and gas pipelines already run through our country, but KXL wasn’t your average pipeline, and tar sands oil isn’t your average crude.", "It's derived from a sludgy, sticky deposit found beneath the wilds of northern Alberta’s boreal forest.", "These sands contain bitumen, a gooey type of petroleum that can be converted into fuel. It’s no small feat extracting oil from tar sands, and doing so comes with steep environmental and economic costs.", "Nevertheless, in the mid-2000s, with gas prices on the rise, oil companies ramped up production and sought additional ways to move their product from Canada’s remote tar sands fields to midwestern and Gulf Coast refineries.", "The proposed Keystone XL extension actually comprised two segments. The first, a southern leg, had already been completed and now runs between Cushing, Oklahoma, and Port Arthur, Texas.", "Opponents of this project—now called the Gulf Coast Pipeline—say that TC Energy took advantage of legal loopholes to push the pipeline through, obtaining authorization under a U.S. Army Corps of Engineers nationwide permit and dodging the more rigorous vetting process for individual permits, which requires public input.", "The second segment was the hotly contested 1,209-mile northern leg—a shortcut of sorts—that would have run from Hardisty, Alberta, through Montana and South Dakota to Steele City, Nebraska.", "In 2015, the U.S. State Department, under President Barack Obama, declined to grant the northern leg of the Keystone XL project the permit required to construct, maintain, and operate the pipeline across the U.S.–Canada border—a permit that President Trump later granted and President Biden once again revoked.", "Dirty energy lobbyists claimed developing tar sands would protect our national energy security and bring U.S. fuel prices down.", "But environmental reviews by both the Obama and Trump administrations concluded that the Keystone XL pipeline would not have lowered gasoline prices.", "NRDC and its partners also found the majority of Keystone XL oil would have been sent to markets overseas—aided by a 2015 reversal of a ban on crude oil exports.", "This lines up with an industry trend: Oil and gas companies are exporting 8.4 million barrels of crude oil and refined fuels every single day.", "That’s up nearly threefold from a decade ago, and an amount equal to 42 percent of our consumption. And these exports are more than 10 times the capacity of the proposed Keystone XL pipeline.", "Tar sands oil is thicker, more acidic, and more corrosive than lighter conventional crude, and this ups the likelihood that a pipeline carrying it will leak.", "Indeed, one study found that between 2007 and 2010, pipelines moving tar sands oil in Midwestern states spilled three times more per mile than the U.S. national average for pipelines carrying conventional crude.", "Since it first went into operation in 2010, TC Energy’s original Keystone Pipeline System has leaked more than a dozen times; one incident in North Dakota sent a 60-foot, 21,000-gallon geyser of tar sands oil spewing into the air.", "Less than two years before the project was finally pulled, the Keystone tar sands pipeline was temporarily shut down after a spill in North Dakota of reportedly more than 378,000 gallons in late October 2019.", "And the risk that Keystone XL would have spilled was heightened because of the extended time the pipe segments were left sitting outside in stockpiles.", "“A study published in early 2020, co-authored by TC Energy’s own scientists, found that the anti-corrosion coating on the project’s pipes was damaged from being stored outside and exposed to the elements for the last decade,” notes NRDC senior attorney Jaclyn Prange, who spent years working on KXL litigation.", "Complicating matters, leaks can be difficult to detect. And when tar sands oil does spill, it’s more difficult to clean up than conventional crude because it immediately sinks to the bottom of the waterway.", "People and wildlife coming into contact with tar sands oil are exposed to toxic chemicals, and rivers and wetland environments are at particular risk from a spill.", "(For evidence, note the 2010 tar sands oil spill in Kalamazoo River, Michigan, a disaster that cost Enbridge more than a billion dollars in cleanup fees and took six years to settle in court.)", "Keystone XL would have crossed agriculturally important and environmentally sensitive areas, including hundreds of rivers, streams, aquifers, and water bodies.", "One was Nebraska’s Ogallala Aquifer, which provides drinking water for millions as well as 30 percent of America’s irrigation water.", "A spill would have been devastating to the farms, ranches, and communities that depend on these crucial ecosystems.", "Even worse, building Keystone XL would have meant enduring those risks just to send the fuel to our overseas rivals—and the profits to Big Oil.", "All facets of the tar sands industry pose a threat to the environment. Its mines are a blight on Canada’s boreal, where mining operations dig up and flatten forests to access the oil below, destroying wildlife habitat and one of the world’s largest carbon sinks.", "The mining depletes and pollutes freshwater resources, creates massive ponds of toxic waste, and threatens the health and livelihood of the First Nations people who live near them.", "Refining the sticky black gunk produces piles of petroleum coke, a hazardous, coal-like by-product. What’s more, the whole process of getting the oil out and making it usable creates three to four times the carbon pollution of conventional crude extraction and processing.", "“This isn’t your grandfather’s typical oil,” says Anthony Swift, director of NRDC’s Canada project. “It’s nasty stuff.”", "A fully realized Keystone XL would have led to more mining of that “nasty stuff” by accelerating the pace at which it’s produced and transported.", "(Indeed, Keystone XL was viewed as an essential ingredient in the oil industry’s plans to triple tar sands production by 2030.)", "It would also have led to greater greenhouse gas emissions—which, the latest scientific reports makes clear, we simply can’t afford if we’re to avoid the most catastrophic climate impacts.", "The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) initially stated that, on a wells-to-wheels basis, tar sands oil emits 17 percent more carbon than other types of crude, but several years later, the State Department revised this number upward, stating that the emissions could be “5 percent to 20 percent higher than previously indicated.”", "That means burdening the planet with an extra 178.3 million metric tons of greenhouse gas emissions annually, the same impact as 38.5 million passenger vehicles or 45.8 coal-fired power plants.", "Finally, massive fossil fuel infrastructure investments like KXL undermine efforts to minimize global warming and prioritize clean energy like wind and solar.", "Leading climate scientist and former NASA researcher James Hansen has warned that fully exploiting Canada’s tar sands reserves by moving forward with these projects would mean “game over” for our climate.", "In short, tar sands oil represents no small threat to our environment, and our best stance against it, as the rallying cry goes, is to “keep it in the ground.”", "Opposition to Keystone XL centered on the devastating environmental consequences of the project. The pipeline faced more than a decade of sustained protests from environmental activists and organizations; Indigenous communities; religious leaders; and the farmers, ranchers, and business owners along its proposed route.", "One such protest, a historic act of civil disobedience outside the White House in August 2011, resulted in the arrest of more than 1,200 demonstrators.", "“This is not a pipeline to America,” said the late civil rights activist Julian Bond, among the many arrested.", "“It’s a pipeline through America, and it threatens to be a disaster for us if it leaks poisons on the way.”", "Leading scientists and economists came out in opposition to the project, in addition to unions and world leaders such as the Dalai Lama, Archbishop Desmond Tutu, and former president Jimmy Carter (together, these and other Nobel laureates have written letters against the project).", "In 2014, more than two million comments urging a rejection of the pipeline were submitted to the U.S. Department of State during a 30-day public comment period.", "But the groundswell of public protest was up against a formidable opponent–hundreds of millions spent on lobbying by the fossil fuel industry.", "In the two years leading up to the November 2014 midterm elections, the fossil fuel industry spent more than $721 million to court allies in Congress.", "When industry-friendly politicians took charge of both congressional houses in January 2015, their first order of business was to pass a bill to speed up approval of Keystone XL.", "(That effort failed.) Later, fossil fuel companies funnelled millions into Trump’s 2017 inauguration ceremony, days after which he brought the Keystone XL project back from the dead, and ramped up federal lobbying efforts in the first months of his administration.", "“So what if there’s no pipeline? Big Oil will find a way.”", "One of the central arguments made by pipeline pushers was that tar sands expansion will move forward with or without Keystone XL.", "This has proved to be untrue. Dealing in tar sands oil is an expensive endeavor. It’s costly both to produce and to ship, particularly by rail, which would be an alternative to Keystone XL.", "Indeed, moving crude by rail to the Gulf costs substantially more than moving it by pipe. For companies considering whether to invest in a long-lived tar sands project (which could last for 50 years), access to cheap pipeline capacity plays a major role in the decision to move forward or not.", "Without Keystone XL, the tar sands industry has been forced to cancel projects rather than shift to rail, subsequently leaving more of the earth’s dirtiest fuel in the ground where it belongs.", "The industry also falsely claimed that the pipeline would be a big source of jobs.", "When TC Energy said the pipeline would create nearly 119,000 jobs, a State Department report instead concluded the project would require fewer than 2,000 two-year construction jobs and that the number of full-time, permanent jobs would hover around 35 after construction.", "When the Obama administration refused to grant the cross-border permit necessary to build TC Energy’s Keystone XL oil pipeline in November 2015, it struck a blow against polluting powers and acknowledged the consensus on this misguided project from a wide swath of communities, experts, and organizations.", "The decision echoed a seven-year State Department review process with EPA input that concluded the pipeline would fail to serve national interests.", "Upon entering office, President Trump—with his pro-polluter cabinet of fossil fuel advocates, billionaires, and bankers—quickly demonstrated that his priorities differed.", "On his fourth day in office, Trump signed an executive order to allow Keystone XL to move forward. On March 28, 2017, his State Department illegally approved a cross-border permit for the pipeline, reversing the Obama administration’s prior determination that KXL would not serve the national interest.", "When that failed—thanks to a lawsuit brought by NRDC and other groups—Trump reissued the cross-border permit himself.", "“We would score a victory, and it would have huge ramifications for holding off construction at critical times,” says NRDC attorney Cecilia Segal, who has worked on KXL litigation since 2017.", "“But then the Trump administration would do something to undercut us outside of court.” The administration also attempted to issue other permits for the project, all based on flawed environmental analyses, eventually prompting more lawsuits, including two from NRDC and its allies.", "Opposition outside the courts was swift and strong as well. Farmers, ranchers, tribes, and conservation groups helped keep the project stalled for Trump’s full four years in office, despite his best efforts to expedite its approval.", "President Biden and the end of the Keystone XL pipeline", "Even as Trump and TC Energy tried to revive the pipeline, polls showed that a majority of Americans opposed it.", "The market case had also deteriorated. Low oil prices and increasing public concern over the climate led Shell, Exxon, Equinor (then Statoil), and Total to either sell their tar sands assets or whittle them down.", "Meanwhile, major new tar sands projects stopped moving forward, despite investments from the government of Alberta, Canada.", "For example, in 2020, Teck Resources withdrew its 10-year application to build the largest tar sands mine in history, citing growing concern surrounding climate change in global markets.", "On the campaign trail, Biden vowed to cancel the Keystone XL cross-border permit should he win the presidency—and on his first day in office, he made good on that promise.", "The revoked permit became the final nail in the pipeline’s coffin. By that point, Keystone XL faced an unfriendly administration, numerous legal challenges, declining oil prices, worsening climate impacts, and a growing movement of climate organizers—along the pipeline’s route and around the world—unwilling to look the other way.", "In June 2021, TC Energy announced that it was abandoning its plans for building the pipeline for good—putting an end to a fossil fuel project that had loomed over waterways, communities, and the climate for more than a decade.", "“Keystone XL was a terrible idea from the start,” Swift said. “It’s time to accelerate our transition to the clean energy sources that will power a prosperous future.”", "While the tar sands industry was once seen as an unbeatable opponent in a David-and-Goliath fight, the victory against Keystone XL shows that the tables have begun to turn–and that more power now lies with the advocates for climate justice than ever before.", "“The era of building fossil fuel pipelines without scrutiny of their potential impact on climate change and on local communities is over,” Swift says.", "This story was originally published on April 7, 2017, and has been updated with new information and links.", "This NRDC.org story is available for online republication by news media outlets or nonprofits under these conditions: The writer(s) must be credited with a byline; you must note prominently that the story was originally published by NRDC.org and link to the original; the story cannot be edited (beyond simple things such as grammar); you can’t resell the story in any form or grant republishing rights to other outlets; you can’t republish our material wholesale or automatically—you need to select stories individually; you can’t republish the photos or graphics on our site without specific permission; you should drop us a note to let us know when you’ve used one of our stories.", "The Desire to Stop Canadian Tar Sands Transcends Borders"]}

According to Fischer (2010, p. 117), “both the analytical and numerical modeling suggest that rate reductions are only likely at lower RPS shares.", "At higher RPS shares, in contrast, the implicit tax quickly dominates and electricity prices increase rapidly.”", "The development of state-level RPSs is, in part, a response to the lack of a more comprehensive national policy for reducing carbon emissions.", "Local development of renewable resources provides an immediate, visible representation of state action to address climate change, even if its impact on global GHG emissions is minimal.", "An analysis by Resources for the Future suggests that state RPSs reduced U.S. CO2 emissions by 4 percent in 2010.", "The authors concluded that, “given that by 2010 the RPS have been in effect for only a few years in many states, this is a fairly significant impact.", "The gap between the two cases [with and without state RPSs] is likely to continue to widen as RPS are fully implemented across the nation” (Sekar and Sohngen, 2014, p. 10).", "Consideration is being given to the continuation or expansion of RPS requirements to achieve higher levels of renewable energy deployment.28", "28 RPS policies may be subject to reconsideration in some states. Ohio recently enacted a 2-year suspension of its RPS requirement, which in the absence of further legislative action would defer full compliance from 2025 to 2027.", "(Ohio also suspended energy-efficiency standards; its action on energy efficiency raises issues that deserve careful study in terms of the suspension’s potential to increase customer costs and slow economic growth.)", "Proposals have been made to repeal RPSs in 18 of the 29 states that have adopted such standards. See http://web20.nixonpeabody.com/energyblog/Lists/Posts/Post.aspx?ID=81&Title=Tough+Times+For+Renewable+Portfolio+Standards (accessed June 20, 2014).", "Identifying the factors that may be important to the adoption of RPSs can involve a review of the arguments advanced and/or a study of the circumstances surrounding their adoption.29 RPS policies also may reflect efforts to limit other environmental externalities, reduce the cost of renewable technologies through enhanced learning by doing, enhance the reliability of distribution with distributed generation, promote the security of energy supplies, preserve water resources, and/or create local jobs in an emerging clean energy industry and potentially capture first-mover advantages (Fischer and Preonas, 2010).", "Although RPSs have reduced CO2 emissions, RPSs are not the most cost-effective means of doing so. As indicated in a previous National Research Council (2010c) report, pricing GHG emissions provides the critical foundation for cost-effective reductions in GHG emissions and the basis for innovation and a sustainable market for renewable energy resources.", "Most studies of alternative renewable energy policies agree that a carbon tax or cap-and-trade system would reduce GHG emissions more cost-effectively than RPSs (see, e.g., Fischer and Newell, 2008; Fischer et al., 2013; Palmer and Burtraw, 2005; Palmer et al., 2010; Tuladhar et al., 2014).", "For example, Palmer and colleagues (2010) compare the cost of achieving a reduction in CO2 emissions using a national RPS—a 25 percent renewable standard by 2025—with that of a cap-and-trade policy achieving the same emissions reduction.", "They estimate that the RPS would have an average cost of $14 per ton of CO2 reduced, while the same reduction could be achieved in a cap-and-trade program for $4 per ton, or less than one-third the cost.", "This finding is not surprising. In requiring the use of renewable technologies, RPSs fail to recognize other actions, such as the substitution of gas- for coal-fired generation, that might reduce emissions more cost-effectively.", "RPSs treat all renewable generation equivalently, as if all renewable generation sources displaced comparable nonrenewable sources and had an equivalent net emissions impact.", "They lower the cost of selected clean energy technologies, but do not incorporate the social costs of carbon and other environmental externalities into the price of polluting resources, potentially distorting price signals for both consumers and other market participants (Borenstein, 2012; Nordhaus, 2013).", "Market-based environmental regulation that appropriately prices both GHGs and other environmental externalities will tend to produce and provide incentives for emission reductions more cost-effectively relative to comparable technology requirements.", "Technology deployment incentives can create innovation benefits by supporting learning by doing.30 However, the appropriate incentive for promoting learning by doing is likely to be lower than the deployment incentives currently available from RPSs, tax credits, and other renewable energy programs.", "29 For one assessment of factors correlating with the adoption of RPSs, see Lyon and Yin (2009).", "General RPSs are not tailored to improving the reliability of distribution, promoting the security of energy supplies, preserving water resources, and/or creating jobs.", "There are many ways to improve the reliability of distribution. Greater reliance on renewable resources might help Western Europe reduce imports of natural gas or help California limit cooling water requirements.", "However, greater reliance on renewables also could increase dependence on imported rare earth elements.", "And while renewable generation will create some jobs, potentially offsetting job losses can be associated with increased power costs.", "Policies specifically designed to achieve these secondary benefits could be more cost-effective in meeting stated objectives.", "A cap-and-trade program could efficiently reduce and price GHG emissions. If a binding emissions trading system were implemented, RPSs would not necessarily produce additional emission reductions, but would likely increase overall compliance costs (Fischer and Preonas, 2010).", "In circumstances where a binding emissions trading system reasonably reflects pollution costs and creates an effective market signal for emission reductions, it would be beneficial for states or regions to evaluate the impacts of replacing RPSs with a cap-and-trade system and more modest, targeted incentives to produce learning-by-doing benefits.", "Savings from reduced renewable energy deployment incentives could be redirected to earlier stages of the innovation system, where greater public resources are needed to support the development and demonstration of new low-carbon technologies (see Chapter 3).", "Ultimately, when possible, states would benefit from seeking to ensure that their policies evolve to establish best practices for competition featuring market signals and other such mechanisms for participants.", "Removing barriers to participation by government agencies and departments as active customers in state and regional markets for renewable energy would also improve opportunities for renewable generation.", "Steps to this end would include enabling federal facilities, such as military bases, to sign PPAs for renewable power.", "The Department of Defense in particular offers opportunities for renewables because of the size of its energy demand and budget, its global footprint, and its mandate to use renewables for 25 percent of its total energy needs by 2025.", "Executive Order 13693 goes a long way toward encouraging the federal government’s role as a leading consumer of increasingly clean energy by setting renewable and alternative energy and energy-efficiency targets for federal facilities.", "Finding 5-9: Few states have conducted benefit-cost analyses of their RPS requirements and evaluated options for evolving their RPSs, learning from other states, and taking innovation and evolving models into account.", "Recommendation 5-7: State and regional authorities should regularly arrange for independent evaluations of the effectiveness and cost of their policies for encouraging", "deployment, competition, cost declines, reductions in financing costs, and other aspects of renewable energy technologies.", "They also should be encouraged to adopt evolving best practices for competition, including market signals and mechanisms, in their state renewable policies and programs.", "Incentives, Subsidies, and Diverse Technology Market Growth", "Subsidies are critically important to emerging technologies, particularly those with life-cycle benefits that are not priced.", "As discussed above, despite significant cost reductions in renewables in recent years, renewables in most areas of the United States still are not cost-competitive and continue to require subsidies as an important component of establishing a path to their eventual competitiveness.", "These subsidy levels have been declining for maturing renewables, with onshore wind having developed into the most cost-effective renewable.", "As of 2013, solar “cash incentives (rebates and performance-based incentives) have fallen by 85-95 percent from their historical peak in 2001-2002, and incentive reductions from 2012-2013 equal 40-50 percent of the drop in installed prices” (Barbose et al., 2014, p. 2).", "Federal subsidies, such as the investment tax credit for solar and the production tax credit for wind, that are targeted at deployment have demonstrated their effectiveness.", "That being the case, subsidies are best not designed to be permanent, but to have sunset provisions and to phase out over time on a technology-by-technology basis, with market tests that consider cost and progress toward unsubsidized competitiveness.", "This type of approach to supporting technology development and early deployment does not constitute picking winners and losers.", "Incentives are applied across a class of technologies, not to a single product or company, with pricing mechanisms that decline over time, but there also are market tests for appropriate phase-out under actual market development conditions.", "These approaches encourage private-sector investment in innovation, infrastructure, and scale-up while avoiding the stop-and-start impacts of short-term extensions of tax credits.", "Another principle for federal and state renewable policies involves appropriate regulatory and financing structures for projects with differing scales:", "- Small, distributed generation projects (such as rooftop solar) reduce but are unlikely to economically eliminate owners’ purchases of electricity in retail markets.", "Appropriate pricing of interconnection with the power company and the grid and pricing for backup services, such as the price of utility-provided power when the distributed generation project is not producing enough power for the customer,", "are important to maximize the value of distributed generation projects.", "- Community-scale renewables provide virtual generation and energy management to multiple customers, and over time are expected to be combined with efficiency, demand response, microgrids, combined heat and power, storage, and other distributed energy approaches and resources.", "Community-scale projects need pricing and rate models that encourage innovation and competition, recognize the value of this distributed virtual system, and also incorporate the evolving role of the utility in integrating and managing the electricity system as an “Internet” network of networks.", "- For utility-scale renewable generation, long-term PPAs have proven effective in incentivizing a number of projects around the country.", "The long-term PPAs have enabled low-cost project financing, since most renewable projects have high capital costs and little or no variable fuel costs.", "Across all technologies and scales, it is important to emphasize that renewable deployment needs to take place in an increasingly competitive market, and to continue to reward learning and economies of scale, as well as projects with the best economics.", "Effective federal, state, and local policies need to be consistent with growing market signals that look out at least 5 years to encourage investment in innovation and development that will continue to bring down costs.", "Reducing the cost of capital for renewable and clean energy projects is an important component of leveling the playing field.", "While this issue is discussed in greater detail in Chapter 7, it is important to acknowledge here the importance of federal and state policies to reducing the financing costs for zero-emission technologies.", "Federal tax changes that would extend real estate investment trust (REIT) and master limited partnership (MLP) financing structures to zero-emission technologies could also help address financing issues related to renewable projects.", "In addition, many states are developing or considering so-called “green banks” to leverage low-cost state borrowing in combined public/private financing structures for lower-cost renewable and energy-efficiency deployment projects.", "The federal government might consider encouraging banks to participate in these green bank programs through approaches similar to the Community Reinvestment Act, which has enabled the deployment of increased private capital for local projects.", "Chapter 6 reviews challenges associated with the regulatory structure of the electric power industry.", "Utilities play critical roles in the deployment of renewables, but current business models for utilities tend to be insufficient for adequately incentivizing the adoption of renewables.", "State and federal incentives and regulations need to encourage utilities to change their priorities and decision processes, but without being unduly burdensome."]}

Participants in these meetings acknowledged that Level 2 charging is favorable to fast charging because it generally requires less electricity at a particular moment in time and can be reasonably managed through time-varying rate designs.", "However, several stakeholders also noted that widespread public fast charging stations are a key consideration for consumers who are looking at buying an EV.", "In other words, while Level 2 charging has the greatest promise of providing benefits to the electric grid, those benefits depend on EV ownership and that partly depends on the perception of available public fast charging stations.", "In this case, by deploying multiple pilots as a package, Xcel Energy was able to address stakeholder interests in both types of charging infrastructure.", "Several participants in our stakeholder meetings made clear that they wanted Xcel Energy’s EV programs to be designed to incentivize charging behavior that doesn’t increase costs at peak times of electricity usage, instead incentivizing usage when renewables are producing power.", "In response to this, Xcel Energy offered a conventional two-part time-varying rate for all three of its EV pilots, with on-peak occurring from 9 a.m. to 9 p.m., and off-peak occurring from 9 p.m. to 9 a.m.", "This proposed rate design led to a two-part discussion that may be insightful to other utilities.", "First, some stakeholders wanted to see a more advanced rate design used for these pilots – one that would deploy more time periods (e.g., four time periods per day rather than two) to send more accurate price signals to customers.", "Notably, and as I’ve written about previously, Xcel Energy received approval for a more advanced residential time-varying rate design pilot in May of 2018, which has four electricity price changes in each day.", "Therefore, some stakeholders wanted to see this rate design deployed for the EV pilots. Second, for the public charging pilot, there was a concern that while the charging station owners (which, in Xcel Energy’s proposed design, will be third parties) would pay time-varying rates, the owners might not necessarily pass those rates on to the EV drivers using the charging stations, eliminating any charging behavior change that would have resulted.", "In response, the PUC allowed the conventional time-varying rate design to move forward in the interim but required Xcel Energy to come back with a more refined rate design for the fleet and public charging EV pilots within six months.", "For the public charging site hosts in particular, the PUC asked charging station operators to use time-varying rates by default, but allowed them to opt-out of doing so if warranted.", "In this particular case, the two-period time-varying rate proved unacceptable to both stakeholders and the commission.", "However, the fact that Xcel Energy had already completed some legwork to design a more advanced time-varying rate made it particularly hard to defend the two-part rate.", "Utilities developing EV programs should certainly be looking at time-varying rate designs, and, based on this experience, would do well to make the price signals in those rate designs as accurate as possible.", "Consumer impacts, including cost recovery for pilot expenses, were of significant concern in our stakeholder meetings, with some participants stressing the importance of ensuring the benefits of EV programs outweigh the costs for all customers, EV drivers and non-EV drivers alike.", "This also became a key point of discussion when the pilots were being considered by the PUC.", "The discussion centered on who should pay for the pilots, since EV infrastructure and services are in the interests of both the utility and ratepayers.", "Consumer advocates argued that, without an analysis showing the measurable benefits to all ratepayers, only the utility and participating customers should pay for the programs, as this is otherwise just a marketing initiative to sell more electricity to some customers at the expense of all.", "The Commission disagreed, stating that it asked the utilities to come forward with innovative EV pilot projects for several reasons in the public interest and this is an example of a utility following through on that request.", "Denying this request would send the wrong signal—that innovation is not rewarded. Therefore, they decided that all ratepayers should fund the pilots, as long as those expenses are shown by the utility to be reasonable and prudent.", "The Commission clarified that the decision applies only to the pilots and that one intended outcome is to gather information that can enable better cost-benefit analysis in the future.", "As part of this, they made the following decisions:", "- While the utility typically does not own and recover costs on infrastructure beyond a customer’s service connection, for the purposes of these pilots the Commission allowed Xcel Energy to classify wiring and charging equipment beyond the meter as part of their distribution system.", "- While customers benefitting from a new service line typically need to contribute to the costs of that line, for these specific pilots the Commission allowed those costs to be spread out across all ratepayers.", "- Finally, Xcel Energy is currently operating under a multi-year rate plan, which is intended to promote innovation by allowing the utility flexibility on costs over multiple years, but within certain pre-established limits.", "While some parties argued that costs for these pilots should count within those limits, Xcel Energy argued that these costs were unforeseen when the limits were established, and that they should be allowed to recover these costs beyond those limits.", "The Commission ultimately agreed, but suggested that Xcel Energy’s next multi-year rate plan should include a proposed research and development budget to avoid this happening again in the future.", "While the decisions made in this case may be unique to Xcel Energy and Minnesota, the broader lesson is that the costs and benefits of utility EV programs need to be thought through carefully, with specific attention to impacts on non-participants.", "In summary, utility EV programs offer a unique opportunity to create benefits for shareholders, consumers, and the environment, but they need to be implemented carefully and thoughtfully.", "Xcel Energy’s pilot programs in Minnesota show that finding a balance among the needs of diverse interests is difficult, but not impossible, and that that upfront stakeholder engagement can be a beneficial step towards ensuring that a utility’s final proposal is as close to acceptable as possible among the parties who will potentially advocate for or against it.", "UPDATE: There was a request submitted to the PUC to reconsider its order approving Xcel’s EV pilots. The request was denied and the denial is now being appealed.", "More information is available in MN PUC Docket 18-643."]}

Depending on a city’s electric utility, a 100 percent renewable electricity goal may be placing disproportionate emphasis on electricity.", "Using data from City B in the previous example, the next graph demonstrates how a change in a utility’s emission factor can alter the breakdown of a community’s emissions profile.", "If the city were to take no climate action and its energy growth remained flat, the proportion of emissions that comes from electricity would be reduced by nearly 75 percent.", "In consideration of prioritizing emissions reductions, the city may want to set its renewable electricity goal based on the planned emissions rather than the current emissions to be better positioned to put resources toward reducing other sources of emissions.", "Another consideration under this scenario is how a community chooses to distinguish between renewable electricity and carbon-free electricity.", "A community in Xcel Energy territory that sets a 100 percent renewable electricity goal may be setting itself back by dismissing existing nuclear generation, which will likely be online through the mid-2030s.", "Nuclear energy generation can be contentious, but it is nonetheless an important consideration when thinking about low-carbon electricity.", "Who has the right to claim the renewable electricity is a matter of who owns the renewable electricity credit (REC).", "In many cases, an individual who owns a solar energy system, for example, may not be able to claim the REC if s/he does not own it.", "For example, participation in a utility production incentive program likely results in the utility owning the RECs.", "Similarly, participation in a utility-run community solar garden program will likely also mean that utility owns the RECs, not the subscriber.", "Both distributed solar installations and community solar gardens have direct economic and environmental benefits, though they may not be counted toward a specific renewable electricity goal.", "Conversely, many utilities offer green power purchase programs where consumers can pay a small premium on their bills to support renewable electricity generation.", "While purchasing RECs through a green power purchase program supports renewable electricity, it won’t provide local economic benefits and may be limited in its impact on greenhouse gas emissions depending on the renewable resource it is connected with, for instance if the source has already been providing electricity to the grid, the carbon attributes will have already been calculated as part of utility’s emissions factor.", "- Set goals that have the biggest impact on the determined priorities.", "- In-boundary solar and efficiency goals will have the greatest local economic and environmental benefits.", "To realize these benefits, avoid goals that are tied to REC ownership. For example, set a goal to install solar on a minimum number of rooftops within the community.", "Community solar garden subscriptions will also support economic and environmental priorities, though job creation may be realized elsewhere.", "- Set a goal where a minimum percent of residents and businesses are subscribed to a community solar garden.", "- Goals that are set to reduce carbon emissions should consider future generation mixes so strategies can be tailored to maximize impact across sectors.", "For communities in municipal or cooperative territories, there may be more flexibility in generation sources.", "- Communities can collaborate with the utility to plan a clean energy future that includes a mix of local and remote generation.", "Many utilities may be limited by long-term generation contracts. There may be opportunity to re-negotiate these contracts or plan the community’s energy vision for when that contract ends.", "- Communities can also leverage efficiency opportunities to support hitting renewable electricity targets and identify the technology or mix of technologies that best fit the community’s available clean energy resources.", "- Whatever goal is set, make sure it fits within the energy and utility context of the community and is in line with the community’s priorities.", "- There is a lot of opportunity to increase the amount of renewable electricity and to reap the economic and environmental benefits locally, so be sure to maximize impact and minimize barriers.", "Ultimately, cities will carve out a path that works best for them, and the more cities that do, the more everyone benefits from success."]}

And this week, the company announced it will be fast-tracking the retirement of its two remaining coal-burning power plants, which are in Minnesota, by 2030.", "So make no mistake: This is industry-shaking news. Here’s our explainer, first published December 5.", "Greater ambition is in Xcel’s political and economic interests", "Xcel has been a leader on clean energy for a while. According to the company, it has reduced its carbon emissions by 35 percent since 2005.", "Earlier in 2018, it announced plans to, by 2030, reduce carbon emissions 60 percent (from 2005 levels), increase the level of renewable energy in its fleet to 55 percent, and shut down 50 percent of its coal capacity — in the state of Colorado.", "Those goals were enough to win the company Utility Dive’s Utility of the Year Award for 2018.", "But the new goals go much farther. And they cover Xcel’s entire eight-state territory.", "So what pushed the company’s ambition so much higher?", "First, renewables are getting really cheap. In its recent solicitations, Xcel has gotten more bids for renewables, with more variety, for much cheaper.", "Wind and solar plants paired with storage are bidding in cheaper than the ongoing operating costs of existing coal plants.", "Renewables are even giving natural gas a run for its money.", "Second, Xcel’s customers — particularly cities — are demanding it. “When your customers are asking for this over and over,” Fowke said when announcing the news, “you really do listen.", "Boulder, the city of Denver, Breckenridge ... Pueblo, they’re considered or they have already decided that they want to pursue 100 percent renewable.”", "Remember that, because it’s important in an age of no federal climate policy: Cities can move utilities, and utilities can move the energy industry.", "Third, the political landscape is shifting. Democrats took the governor’s mansion in Colorado, Michigan, New Mexico, and Wisconsin.", "In Colorado and New Mexico, they now have a “trifecta” — governor and both legislative houses. Running for governor in Colorado, Jared Polis supported a new renewable energy standard of 100 percent by 2040; with Democratic majorities in the state legislature, he might get it passed.", "Renewables are on the rise in the West, popular with politicians, cities, corporations, and ordinary ratepayers.", "It is to Xcel’s benefit to get ahead of the curve and give the people what they want.", "Fourth, Xcel would very much like to build more stuff.", "It is a vertically integrated monopoly. The areas in which it operates have not been “restructured,” i.e., generation has not been split off from transmission and distribution.", "Regulated monopoly utilities, as I’ve explained in previous stories, do not make money on the power they sell or the fuel they buy.", "They make money by drawing a rate of return on investments in power infrastructure. These “rate-based” investments are the utility’s bread and butter.", "In a broad sense, the shift to renewables is good for such utilities. When they shift from existing fossil fuel plants to new renewable energy, they shift from fuel (coal and natural gas) costs, which they make no money on, to investments in new renewable energy power plants, new batteries to store power and electric car chargers to help electrify the vehicle fleet, and tons of new transmission lines, much of which they can rate-base.", "These goals (perhaps combined with a new, more stringent RPS in Colorado) will help Xcel get permission from regulators to depreciate lots of uneconomic old fossil-fuel assets (which activists have been hassling it about anyway) and build, build, build a bunch of new stuff.", "In short, Xcel stands to profit handsomely, and benefit politically, by giving its customers the clean energy they want.", "(Many ratepayer advocates worry that utilities like Duke are taking advantage of this dynamic, using clean energy as an excuse to build stuff that local, distributed energy could handle better — but that’s a different post.)", "A more interesting question is how this might affect Xcel’s monopoly status. On one hand, riding a political wave as a climate champion allows it to stay ahead of grumbling or desire for restructuring.", "On the other hand, Xcel suddenly needing so much clean energy might help grease the skids for regionalization, i.e., the creation of a restructured Western wholesale power market run by a regional transmission operator (RTO).", "If all of the West is heading toward decarbonization together, the region’s utilities will need to pool their resources.", "In fact, they might need to pool their resources rapidly, because the federal tax credits for wind and solar power are set to expire soon.", "Buying a lot of capacity before then could save a lot of money.", "Fifth — and this may be somewhat peripheral, but it’s interesting — on the very same day Xcel made its announcement, the Boulder City Council voted to move forward with creating a municipal utility and breaking off from Xcel.", "Xcel very much opposes that move. By ramping up its clean energy goals, it may not keep Boulder, but it could dissuade other similar-minded cities from following Boulder out the door.", "Anyway, the decision to go carbon-free by 2050 is not a selfless act on Xcel’s part — it sees which way the wind is blowing and is focused on providing returns for shareholders.", "And the announcement leaves many, many details unspecified, including plans to shut down fossil fuel plants and transition plans for affected communities.", "Nonetheless, it shows that incentives are beginning to align in a hopeful way. It is the smart move, politically and economically, for Xcel to set a course for zero carbon.", "That would have been unthinkable 10 or even five years ago.", "A few other aspects of this story are worth highlighting.", "Xcel explicitly did not promise 100 percent renewable electricity. It promised 100 percent carbon-free electricity.", "In this, it echoed California’s recent bill SB 100, which committed the state to 100 percent carbon-free energy by 2045.", "The difference is that carbon-free includes not only renewables but also advanced nuclear power plants and fossil fuel power plants with carbon capture and sequestration, either of which Xcel may end up needing to get to 100.", "The company believes that its 2030 goal can be achieved affordably with renewable energy and other technologies currently available.", "However, achieving the long-term vision of zero-carbon electricity requires technologies that are not cost effective or commercially available today.", "That is why Xcel Energy is committed to ongoing work to develop advanced technologies while putting the necessary policies in place to achieve this transition.", "Both sides of this message are incredibly important and poorly understood by the general public.", "First, we have a really good idea of how to get to 80 percent. Climate researcher Christopher Clack and his team showed in 2016 that the entire US could get to 80 percent using existing commercial technologies.", "We know we can get to 80, but 80 is a long, long way off almost everywhere. There is, in other words, no reason to wait.", "And second, we’re not yet sure how to get that last 20 percent, so we need to keep researching new techniques and technologies in the meantime.", "Xcel is going to work with state regulators to try to do some ratepayer-supported R&D. That seems like a really good idea.", "Targeting zero carbon before we know exactly how to achieve it is the kind of aspirational courage that will very much be needed if the US ever gets anything like a Green New Deal.", "A final side note here: Xcel runs two nuclear plants in Minnesota, which provide almost 30 percent of Xcel power in the Upper Midwest.", "Their licenses will be up around 2030. It’s very likely that to stay on track for its carbon targets, Xcel will need to keep those plants running for longer than that.", "Math like this is what has driven a substantial recent shift in opinion among greens about the wisdom of keeping existing nuclear plants open.", "Somewhat by coincidence, the same day Xcel made its announcement, A.P. Moller-Maersk, the world’s largest shipping container company, announced that it will target carbon neutrality by 2050, though, it said, “carbon neutral vessels must be commercially viable by 2030, and an acceleration in new innovations and adaption of new technology is required.”", "This came on the heels, last month, of Google’s announcement that it would strive to run all its operations on 100 percent clean energy, at all times, around the clock.", "There are now hundreds of companies (Ikea, Apple, BMW, Coca-Cola, Facebook, etc.), more than 90 US cities (Minneapolis, Denver, St. Louis, Atlanta, Salt Lake City, etc.), and two US states (Hawaii and California) committed to reaching 100 percent clean electricity.", "This is how the real target — zero net carbon — will arrive in the US: not in a blinding flash or a big federal bill (at least not at first), but like a virus or a meme, catching hold and spreading through contact.", "Researchers have found that both rooftop solar panels and electric vehicles are contagious. People are more likely to buy them when they see other people buying them.", "Human beings are social creatures, not autonomous utility maximizers. We don’t reason through our purchases and our lifestyles; we generally adopt what’s around us and do what people like us do.", "The very same is true of urban policy makers, corporate officers, utility executives, and state regulators.", "You can show them all the charts and graphs you want — until they see others like them doing these things, they won’t feel confident.", "Now more and more people are doing it, and more and more people are seeing other people doing it. The virus is spreading.", "With Xcel and Platte River Power Authority’s news commitments, the virus has spread into the utility industry."]}

First, meal planning might address the issue of not knowing what to prepare for dinner, that has been previously described as a barrier for home meal preparation [29].", "Second, by planning meals individuals may think about recipes that can be prepared in a limited period of time and, therefore reduce the feeling of time scarcity, that may limit home meal preparation", "[6, 12, 16] and increase the recourse to food choice coping strategies such as eating out, delivery meals or ready prepared food", "[17, 23–25]. In addition, planning meals may reduce the risk of missing ingredients for home meal preparation which could also lead to the consumption of food prepared away from home.", "Finally, deciding what foods will be eaten in the next few days could also enable individuals to cook more diversified recipes and to anticipate grocery shopping for the specific ingredients needed, thus potentially explaining the increased food variety observed in meal planners.", "However, reverse causality cannot be excluded since individuals interested in having a healthy diet might be more likely to plan their meals.", "In line with this idea, meal-planners in our sample were more likely to have higher educational level, to have higher income, to be physically active and to have a lower BMI, characteristics that have been related with a better attitude towards healthy eating [61].", "Our results showed that women who planned meals were less likely to be overweight or obese, while in men, there was an association with obesity only.", "Since meal planners have a diet of higher quality, it potentially prevents overweight in these individuals [52].", "However, we cannot exclude reverse causality.

As an example, we observed that the ingredients available during grocery shopping are likely to influence meal planning while existing tools rather propose menus to plan grocery shopping.", "A major strength of this study was its large sample size allowing an evaluation of meal planning practices at a population level.", "The wide range of socio-economic and lifestyle variables collected through the web-based platform enables the control of potential effects of confounding factors.", "In addition, the web-based tool used to assess 24-h dietary records has shown a good validity in prior studies [63, 64].", "However, because of the influence of seasonality on food variety, the FFQ was used to evaluate dietary variety since it allows usual intake estimates over a relatively long period of time [65].", "This study was also subject to several limitations. First, the cross-sectional design of this study prevented any inference of causality.", "Moreover, since participants were volunteers in a nutrition focused cohort, they may have higher health consciousness and interest in nutritional issues.", "The fact that we selected only participants who completed both dietary assessment tools might have exacerbated this characteristic in our sample.", "Therefore, caution is needed when generalizing our results. However, sensitivity analyses including individuals with at least one of the dietary assessments (24-h dietary records or FFQ) revealed similar trends.", "Besides, the fact that participants had relatively high knowledge in nutrition could potentially account for the few differences observed in energy and food group intakes, since they may be able to cook healthful meals without planning meals.", "It is also important to consider that food variety score was based on FFQ data, which has been recorded at different time frames (16 months after the inclusion in the cohort).", "Thus, for participants included since a long time in the cohort study, the estimation may not represent their current dietary repertoire.", "In addition, data were self-reported, thus potentially leading to misreporting due, for example, to desirability bias.", "Nonetheless, previous validation studies performed on a subsample of the NutriNet-Santé study have supported the good validity of self-reported anthropometric and dietary data [63, 64, 66].", "Finally, given that meal planning may be influenced by numerous parameters such as cooking practices and food availability in the surrounding, it is possible that some factors mediating the associations observed in the present paper were not taken into account in the analyses.", "The potential impact of cooking practices was however considered by adding cooking frequency as a confounder.", "Future research should be conducted to address the issue of how food availability could potentially influence the relationship observed between meal planning and diet quality.", "Our results highlighted that individuals planning their meals were more likely to have a better dietary quality, including a higher adherence with nutritional guidelines as well as an increased food variety.", "Additionally, meal planning was associated with lower odds of being obese in men and women and overweight in women only.", "Although interventional or prospective research should be conducted in order to infer causality, these data suggest the potential interest of promoting meal planning to improve dietary quality and prevent overweight.", "Such a tool could partly address the issue of time scarcity reported by consumers for meal preparation and, might therefore encourage home cooking.", "Given the potential benefits of meal planning identified in this study, it would be interesting that future research evaluate the appropriation and the impact of applications designed to help individuals planning their meals.", "We thank all scientists, dieticians, technicians, and assistants who help carry out the NutriNet-Santé study.", "We especially thank Younes Esseddik, Yasmina Chelghoum, Mohand Ait Oufella, Paul Flanzy and Thi Hong Van Duong, computer scientists; Veronique Gourlet, Charlie Menard, Fabien Szabo, Nathalie Arnault, Laurent Bourhis and Stephen Besseau, statisticians; and the dieticians.", "We are grateful to volunteers from the NutriNet-Santé study.", "The NutriNet-Santé Study is supported by the French Ministry of Health (DGS), the French Institute for Public Health Surveillance (InVS), the French National Institute for Health and Medical Research (INSERM), the French National Institute for Agricultural Research (INRA), the Medical Research Foundation (FRM), the National Conservatory for Arts and Crafts (CNAM), the National Institute for Prevention and Health Education (INPES) and the University of Paris 13.", "This study is supported by the National Institute for Prevention and Health Education (INPES).", "In France, there is a very strict regulation concerning the protection of personal data and privacy making difficult the availability of data (even non-nominal data).", "PD: conducted the literature review, drafted the manuscript and performed analyses; CM, VA, GI, BA, EKG, SH and SP: were involved in the interpretation of results and critically reviewed the manuscript; and SH and SP: were responsible for the development of the design and the protocol of the study.", "All authors read and approved the final manuscript.", "The authors declare that they have no competing interests.", "This study is conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki, and all procedures were approved by the Institutional Review Board of the French Institute for Health and Medical Research (IRB Inserm n°0000388FWA00005831) and the Commission Nationale de l’Informatique et des Libertés (CNIL n°908450 and n°909216).", "All participants provided informed consent with an electronic signature.

The consequences of iNKT dysfunction or exhaustion during infection could be considerable due to the unique role of iNKT cells in linking, and directing, innate and adaptive immunity.", "A hallmark of iNKT activation is the rapid production of a vast array of cytokines and chemokines [35-37].", "Other iNKT effector functions include perforin/granzyme release associated with NKG2D engagement [38-42], and Fas/FasL-mediated cytotoxicity [36,39].", "In addition to direct cytolytic function and cytokine secretion, iNKTs play an important role in the activation and regulation of other immune cell subsets.", "iNKT activation reciprocally modulates DC function [43-45] and quickly leads to NK cell activation in an IFNγ-dependent manner, followed by T and B cell activation [46].", "Stimulation of iNKT cells in conjunction with soluble T cell antigen enhances both CD4+ and CD8+ antigen-specific responses [47,48].", "Consequently, loss of iNKT function can lead to significant defects in adaptive immunity. Data from non-human primate studies suggests that pre-infection iNKT frequency correlates with retention of CD4 count following SIV challenge, and supernatant from iNKT cultures is sufficient to inhibit HIV replication in vitro.", "To date, the determinants of iNKT dysfunction during HIV infection are poorly understood. In one study, the exhaustion marker PD-1, which contributes to loss of T cell function in HIV infection, was unrelated to iNKT dysfunction [30], but the role of other inhibitory receptors such as LAG-3 has not been assessed.", "In this context, several gaps in knowledge remain. Although T cell LAG-3 expression is generally low, no studies to date have included cohorts of African populations where T cell immune activation is significantly higher compared to Caucasians [49] and HIV clade A/D/C infections predominate.", "We also extended our studies of LAG-3 expression beyond CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, given reports of LAG-3 expression on activated NK and ex vivo iNKT cells and simultaneously assessed LAG-3 expression on T cell, NK and iNKT subsets among a population of healthy and HIV-infected Kenyan commercial sex workers.", "In a follow-up study, we determined the functional consequences of the association between LAG-3 expression and iNKT cytokine production in chronically infected and ART-treated individuals.", "This is the first study to functionally assess LAG-3 on multiple lymphocyte populations among an African cohort.", "A total of 10 HIV-, 40 HIV+ ART naïve and 40 HIV+ ART experienced women were recruited for the study (Table 1).", "The gating strategy for ex vivo samples is shown in an (Additional file 1).

The aim of our cross-sectional study was to investigate the association between meal planning and diet quality, including adherence to nutritional guidelines and food variety, as well as weight status.", "Meal planning, i.e. planning ahead the foods that will be eaten for the next few days, was assessed in 40,554 participants of the web-based observational NutriNet-Santé study.", "Dietary measurements included intakes of energy, nutrients, food groups, and adherence to the French nutritional guidelines (mPNNS-GS) estimated through repeated 24-h dietary records.", "A food variety score was also calculated using Food Frequency Questionnaire. Weight and height were self-reported.", "Association between meal planning and dietary intakes were assessed using ANCOVAs, while associations with quartiles of mPNNS-GS scores, quartiles of food variety score and weight status categories (overweight, obesity) were evaluated using logistic regression models.", "A total of 57% of the participants declared to plan meals at least occasionally. Meal planners were more likely to have a higher mPNNS-GS (OR quartile 4 vs. 1 = 1.13, 95% CI: [1.07–1.20]), higher overall food variety (OR quartile 4 vs. 1 = 1.25, 95% CI: [1.18–1.32]).", "In women, meal planning was associated with lower odds of being overweight (OR = 0.92 [0.87–0.98]) and obese (OR = 0.79 [0.73–0.86]).", "In men, the association was significant for obesity only (OR = 0.81 [0.69–0.94]).", "Meal planning was associated with a healthier diet and less obesity. Although no causality can be inferred from the reported associations, these data suggest that meal planning could potentially be relevant for obesity prevention.", "In industrialized countries, eating habits and cooking practices have considerably changed. First, time devoted to cooking has decreased: in the United States, it has been reduced from 1:63 hour per day in 1965–1966 to 58 min in 2006–2007 [1].", "Additionally, the source of food consumed has changed: people consume less food prepared at home, whereas foods prepared away from home represent an increasing part of the diet", "In light of this observation, a number of studies have evaluated the potential impact of food prepared away from home on dietary quality, as well as weight status.", "These studies highlighted that the consumption of food prepared away from home is associated with a lower quality diet [5–8] and a higher body mass index [9–11], whereas benefits have been attributed to home-prepared food [2, 12–14].", "More frequent home food preparation has been associated with better adherence to dietary objectives [12], higher intakes of fruits, vegetables [13, 14], fiber, folate and vitamin A, while lower intakes of fat in young people [13].", "Therefore, home meal preparation has been increasingly promoted as a strategy for improving dietary quality and preventing obesity [12–15].", "In designing strategies to promote home cooking, it is important to understand the patterns and correlates of home meal practices.", "Many studies have investigated the reasons why people cook less. Time scarcity and cooking skills were identified as common barriers to prepare home meals [6, 11, 12, 16, 17].", "Previous research emphasized that individuals with lower cooking skills were more likely to consume away from home food such as ready meals or take-out meals from fast food or restaurants [11, 18].", "In response to these difficulties, a number of studies have evaluated the opportunity to improve cooking skills in order to promote healthy dietary patterns [19–21].", "To face time pressure, a series of qualitative studies highlighted that parents resort to food choice coping strategies, such as meal simplification, taking out, or meal planning [16, 17, 22–26] despite their potential impact on diet quality.", "Among these strategies, time management skills [27] and in particular meal planning [28, 29], which consists in deciding ahead the foods that will be eaten in the next few days, has been previously suggested as a solution to balance competing time demands and reduce barriers to healthy dietary practices.", "In the literature, very few studies have investigated meal planning practices and they often focused on adequate diet for diabetic subjects", "[30–32]. Studies performed on general populations showed that meal planning was positively associated with frequencies of home food preparation [29] and family meal [33], as well as the presence of fruits for dinner [34].", "To our knowledge, only one study in the literature has evaluated the potential link between meal planning and food consumption.", "It focused on fruit and vegetables specifically, and showed that planning meal ahead was associated with higher fruit and vegetable intakes [35].", "However, the latter presented weakness in the dietary intake assessment method since it consisted only of questions on the number of servings eaten per day.", "Additionally, meal planning was evaluated, among various practices, as a tool to maintain weight among successful weight losers [36, 37] but no data exists on the potential relationship with weight status in the general population.", "In the present study, we hypothesize that meal planning might encourage home meal preparation, and therefore have beneficial effects on dietary quality and consequently on weight status.", "Thus, we first described meal planning practices among a large sample of individuals. Then, we investigated the relationships between meal planning and diet quality, based on adherence to nutritional guidelines, energy, macronutrients and food group intakes, as well as food variety.", "Finally, we evaluated the association between meal planning and weight status.", "The NutriNet-Santé study (http://info.etude-nutrinet-sante.fr) is an ongoing web-based prospective observational cohort study launched in France in May 2009 with a scheduled follow-up of 10 years.", "It aims to investigate the relationship between nutrition and chronic disease risk, as well as the determinants of dietary behavior and nutritional status.", "The study was implemented in the French general population (internet-using adult volunteers, aged ≥18 years).", "The rationale, design and methodology of the study have been fully described elsewhere [38]. In brief, to be included into the study, participants have to complete a baseline set of self-administered web-based questionnaires assessing dietary intake, physical activity, anthropometric characteristics, lifestyle, socioeconomic conditions and health status.", "As part of the follow-up, participants are asked to complete the same set of questionnaires each year.", "Moreover, each month, participants are invited by e-mail to fill in optional questionnaires related to dietary intake, determinants of eating behaviors, nutritional and health status.", "This study is conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki, and all procedures were approved by the Institutional Review Board of the French Institute for Health and Medical Research (IRB Inserm n°0000388FWA00005831) and the Commission Nationale de l’Informatique et des Libertés (CNIL n°908450 and n°909216).", "All participants provided informed consent with an electronic signature. This study is registered in EudraCT (n°2013-000929-31).", "Meal planning practices were assessed via an optional questionnaire launched in the NutriNet-Santé cohort study in April 2014.", "First, grocery shopping and cooking practices were evaluated. In particular, participants were asked to indicate whether they were involved in grocery shopping (every day, several times a week, once a week, less than once a week) and cooking (every day twice a day, every day once a day, several times a week but not every day, once a week, less than once a week, never) in their household.", "Then, participants were asked the following question “Generally, when do you choose the foods you are going to eat for meal?”", "(just before meal, during the day, the day before, few days before, one week before, never). Participants responding “never” were exempted to complete the rest of the questionnaire.", "Participants were also asked whether having to think about what they have to cook is a constraint for them.", "The responses were rated on a 5-point Likert scale ranging from one (strongly disagree) to five (strongly agree).", "Participants were then asked whether they planned meals, even in an irregular manner (yes I do, yes I did but not anymore, no I never planned meals).", "The definition of “planning meals” given to the participants was “to plan ahead the foods that will be eaten for the next few days”.", "Participants who reported planning meal currently were considered as “meal planners” whereas others were categorized as “non-meal planners”.", "Finally, the questionnaire included questions about meal planning frequency (several times a week, once a week, once every two weeks, two to three times a month, not regularly), duration (a few days, one week, two weeks or more), period of the week (weekdays, weekend, weekdays and weekend) and sources of inspiration (personal recipe repertoire, Internet or apps, ingredients available during grocery shopping).", "At baseline and annually thereafter, participants in the NutriNet-Santé study are asked to provide socio-demographic data, including sex, age (18–30, 30–50, 50–65, >65 years), educational level (up to secondary, some college or university degree), monthly income (<1,200 €, 1,200–1,800 €, 1,800–2,700 € and >2,700 € per consumption unit), presence of children in the household (yes, no), history of dieting to lose weight during the past year (yes, no) and physical activity (low, moderate, high).", "Monthly household income is calculated per “consumption unit” (CU), where one CU is attributed for the first adult in the household, 0.5 CU for other persons aged 14 or older, and 0.3 CU for children under 14, following national statistics methodology and guidelines [39].", "Physical activity was assessed using a short form of the French version of the International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ).", "The weekly energy expenditure expressed in metabolic equivalent task minutes per week was estimated, and three scores of physical activity were constituted [i.e., low (<30 min/day), moderate (30–59 min/day), and high (≥60 min/day)]", "according to the French guidelines for physical activity [40].", "For the present study, we used the closest available data with respect to the assessment of meal planning practices.", "At inclusion and once a year thereafter, participants are invited to complete three non-consecutive 24-h dietary records, randomly assigned over a 2-week period (two weekdays and one weekend day).", "For the present analysis, we selected participants who completed at least three 24-h dietary records since their inclusion in the cohort study (i.e. completed between May 2009 and December 2014).", "Participants reported all foods and beverages consumed at each eating occasion. They estimated the amounts eaten using validated photographs of portion sizes [41], using household measures or by indicating the exact quantity (grams) or volume (milliliters).", "Daily mean food intakes were calculated, weighted for the type of day of the week. Energy, nutrient and food group intakes were estimated using the NutriNet-Santé composition table including more than 2000 foods [42].", "Dietary underreporting was identified on the basis of the method proposed by Black [43]. We hypothesize that meal planning encourages food preparation and therefore considered food groups that can be used in food preparation (e.g. eggs).", "In addition, we considered food groups that have nutritional interest (e.g. fruits). Thus, the following food groups were included in the study: fruits, vegetables, fish (including seafood and processed seafood), meat (including cooked ham, offal), eggs, milk, cheese, added fats (including oil, butter, margarine, vinaigrette), sugary products (e.g. cake, biscuits, sugars, honey, jam, chocolate) and starchy foods (including potato, legumes, pasta, rice, other cereals) with a specific focus on legumes and whole grain starchy foods (including whole grain pasta, rice, other cereals).", "Adherence to nutritional guidelines was assessed using the PNNS Guideline Score (PNNS-GS). The 15-point PNNS-GS is a validated a priori score reflecting the adherence to the official French nutritional guidelines which has been extensively described elsewhere [44].", "Details on computation of this score are in Additional file 1. Briefly, it includes 13 components: eight refer to food-serving recommendations (fruit and vegetables; starchy foods; whole grain products; dairy products; meat, eggs and fish; fish and seafood; vegetable fat; water vs. soda), four refer to moderation in consumption (added fat; salt; sweets; alcohol) and one component pertains to physical activity [44, 45].", "Points are deducted for overconsumption of salt (>12 g/day), added sugars (>17.5% of energy intake), or when energy intake exceeds the needed energy level by more than 5%.", "Each component cut-off was that of the threshold defined by the PNNS public health objectives when available [45] otherwise they were established according to the French Recommended Dietary Allowances [46].", "For the present analysis, we consider the mPNNS-GS, a modified version of the PNNS-GS, which takes into account only the dietary components, therefore excluding the physical activity component.", "Food variety has been defined as the number of different food items reported to be eaten over a given reference period [47].", "Considering that seasonality is likely to influence food variety and that a period of 10 to 15 days has been recommended to accurately assess food variety [48], the food variety was evaluated using a Food Frequency Questionnaire (FFQ).", "Sixteen months after baseline, participants were invited to complete a self-administrated 240-items FFQ to assess their usual dietary intake over the past year [49].", "Participants were asked to report their consumption frequency on the basis of how many times they ate the standard portion size proposed (typical household measurements such as spoon or standard unit such as a yogurt).", "The frequency of consumption referred to usual consumption over the past year on an increasing scale including yearly, monthly, weekly or daily units, as suitable, and participants were asked to provide only one answer.", "The food variety score corresponded to the number of FFQ items reported to be consumed at least once during the last year [47].", "The maximum score was therefore 240. Fruit and vegetable variety scores were also computed based on the number of different fruits and vegetables reported by the participants.", "Height and weight were assessed by using an anthropometric questionnaire, which was self-administered online, at baseline and each year thereafter [50, 51].", "For each participant, the closest available data to the meal planning questionnaire were used for the analysis.", "Data were not collected for pregnant women. BMI (in kg/m2) was calculated as the ratio of weight to squared height.", "Participants were classified as underweight or normal weight (BMI < 25), overweight (25 ≤ BMI < 30) and obesity (BMI ≥ 30) according to WHO references values [52].", "The analysis focused on participants who had completed the meal planning questionnaire, had declared being involved in meal preparation in their household, and who had completed at least three 24-h dietary records since they were included in the study, as well as the FFQ.", "Chi-square tests and Student’s t tests were used to compare characteristics of included vs. excluded participants, as well as meal planners vs. non-meal planners.", "Meal planners’ practices were also described. Continuous variables are presented as means ± SDs and categorical variables as percentages.", "ANCOVAs were performed to investigate the relationship between meal planning and energy, macronutrients and food groups.", "However, for some particular food groups which did not exhibit normal distribution (i.e. eggs, milk, legumes, and whole grain starchy foods), mainly due to a high proportion of non-consumers, a binary variable (consumer/non-consumer) was created and a logistic regression analysis was performed.", "Logistic regression models were also used to assess the associations between meal planning and quartiles of mPNNS-GS, as well as quartiles of food variety scores (overall, fruit and vegetable) and BMI categories.", "Due to significant interactions and differences on the associations with meal planning, analyses on BMI were performed separately by sex.", "Meal planning has been described as a cooking skill [53]. Thus, characteristics that have been shown to influence cooking practices, dietary intakes or weight status were considered as confounders in the present analyses.", "Models were therefore all adjusted for sex [1, 54, 55], age [56], educational level, monthly income [6], presence of children in the household [6], history of dieting to lose weight during the past year [57], physical activity [58], and cooking frequency.", "Models evaluating the associations with mPNNS-GS, macronutrient and food groups intakes were further adjusted for daily energy intake and number of 24-h dietary records completed by participants.", "The energy model was only adjusted on the number of 24-h records while the food variety models were adjusted on daily energy intake.", "Missing covariate data were imputed using multiple imputation method.", "Sensitivity analyses were conducted on a subsample of individuals having responded to at least one of the dietary assessments (i.e. FFQ, dietary records).", "In addition, analyses were conducted using another definition of food variety score (number of FFQ items reported to be consumed more than once a week)", "All tests of statistical significance were two-sided and the type I error was set at 5%.

Among the included participants, 57.4% declared to plan their meals at least occasionally whereas 42.6% did not, among which 17.3% planned in the past and 25.3% never planned meals.", "Overall, the same proportions were observed in men (meal planners: 55.9% vs. non-meal planners: 44.1%) and women (meal planners: 57.8% vs. non-meal planners: 42.2%), but women were more likely to have planned meals in the past compared to men (19.0% vs. 11.3%).", "Table 1 presents the sociodemographic and economic characteristics of meal planners and non-meal planners, as well as mean scores for mPNNS-GS, overall food variety and overweight prevalence.", "Overall, differences between the two groups were relatively limited.

Generally, individuals planned their meals several times a week, for a few days period including weekdays and weekend, and get inspiration mostly from their personal recipe repertoire or ingredients available during grocery shopping.", "A previous survey evaluating Canadians’ attitudes and habits with regard to home food preparation highlighted that about 40% of the participants decide what they will prepare for dinner during the day, 27% the day before and 33% at least two days before [29].", "However, the latter did not explore the modalities of meal planning.", "Based on a large sample of general population, our data support the notion that planning meal is indeed associated with a better adherence to nutritional guidelines and an increased food variety (overall, fruits and vegetables).", "However, it should be noted that only small differences were observed with energy, macronutrient and food group intakes specifically.", "Although meal planning has been previously suggested as a potential tool to improve dietary quality [28, 29], to our knowledge, no study in the literature has investigated this related association.", "Previous authors highlighted that individuals deciding in advance what to prepare for dinner were more likely to cook homemade dishes [29].", "Since more frequent food preparation has been linked with a better diet quality [12–14], this could potentially explain the healthier diet observed in meal planners.", "A few hypotheses can be made on how meal planning could encourage home food preparation. First, meal planning might address the issue of not knowing what to prepare for dinner, that has been previously described as a barrier for home meal preparation [29].", "Second, by planning meals individuals may think about recipes that can be prepared in a limited period of time and, therefore reduce the feeling of time scarcity, that may limit home meal preparation", "[6, 12, 16] and increase the recourse to food choice coping strategies such as eating out, delivery meals or ready prepared food", "[17, 23–25]. In addition, planning meals may reduce the risk of missing ingredients for home meal preparation which could also lead to the consumption of food prepared away from home.", "Finally, deciding what foods will be eaten in the next few days could also enable individuals to cook more diversified recipes and to anticipate grocery shopping for the specific ingredients needed, thus potentially explaining the increased food variety observed in meal planners.", "However, reverse causality cannot be excluded since individuals interested in having a healthy diet might be more likely to plan their meals.", "In line with this idea, meal-planners in our sample were more likely to have higher educational level, to have higher income, to be physically active and to have a lower BMI, characteristics that have been related with a better attitude towards healthy eating [61].", "Our results showed that women who planned meals were less likely to be overweight or obese, while in men, there was an association with obesity only.", "Since meal planners have a diet of higher quality, it potentially prevents overweight in these individuals [52].", "However, we cannot exclude reverse causality. People attaching more importance to food and weight management might be more likely to plan their meals.", "In line with this hypothesis, two studies in the literature highlighted that meal planning is more frequently used by successful weight loss maintainers compared to those who did not maintain weight losses [36, 37].", "In terms of public health, our results bring supportive insights that promoting meal planning might encourage the preparation of healthier and more varied home meals.", "Previous studies showed that parents would be interested in learning how to plan meals [28, 60], however, other findings suggested that meal planning is also perceived as complex and time consuming [62].", "Specific tools might assist people in managing meal planning but to be adopted and sustainable over time, it is important to identify consumers’ needs.", "The present data highlighted that there are various ways of planning meals. As an example, we observed that the ingredients available during grocery shopping are likely to influence meal planning while existing tools rather propose menus to plan grocery shopping.", "A major strength of this study was its large sample size allowing an evaluation of meal planning practices at a population level.", "The wide range of socio-economic and lifestyle variables collected through the web-based platform enables the control of potential effects of confounding factors.", "In addition, the web-based tool used to assess 24-h dietary records has shown a good validity in prior studies [63, 64].", "However, because of the influence of seasonality on food variety, the FFQ was used to evaluate dietary variety since it allows usual intake estimates over a relatively long period of time [65].", "This study was also subject to several limitations. First, the cross-sectional design of this study prevented any inference of causality.", "Moreover, since participants were volunteers in a nutrition focused cohort, they may have higher health consciousness and interest in nutritional issues.", "The fact that we selected only participants who completed both dietary assessment tools might have exacerbated this characteristic in our sample.", "Therefore, caution is needed when generalizing our results. However, sensitivity analyses including individuals with at least one of the dietary assessments (24-h dietary records or FFQ) revealed similar trends.", "Besides, the fact that participants had relatively high knowledge in nutrition could potentially account for the few differences observed in energy and food group intakes, since they may be able to cook healthful meals without planning meals.", "It is also important to consider that food variety score was based on FFQ data, which has been recorded at different time frames (16 months after the inclusion in the cohort).", "Thus, for participants included since a long time in the cohort study, the estimation may not represent their current dietary repertoire.", "In addition, data were self-reported, thus potentially leading to misreporting due, for example, to desirability bias.", "Nonetheless, previous validation studies performed on a subsample of the NutriNet-Santé study have supported the good validity of self-reported anthropometric and dietary data [63, 64, 66].", "Finally, given that meal planning may be influenced by numerous parameters such as cooking practices and food availability in the surrounding, it is possible that some factors mediating the associations observed in the present paper were not taken into account in the analyses.", "The potential impact of cooking practices was however considered by adding cooking frequency as a confounder.", "Future research should be conducted to address the issue of how food availability could potentially influence the relationship observed between meal planning and diet quality.", "Our results highlighted that individuals planning their meals were more likely to have a better dietary quality, including a higher adherence with nutritional guidelines as well as an increased food variety.", "Additionally, meal planning was associated with lower odds of being obese in men and women and overweight in women only.", "Although interventional or prospective research should be conducted in order to infer causality, these data suggest the potential interest of promoting meal planning to improve dietary quality and prevent overweight.", "Such a tool could partly address the issue of time scarcity reported by consumers for meal preparation and, might therefore encourage home cooking.", "Given the potential benefits of meal planning identified in this study, it would be interesting that future research evaluate the appropriation and the impact of applications designed to help individuals planning their meals.", "Modified Programme National Nutrition Santé-Guideline Score", "Smith LP, Ng SW, Popkin BM.

It was believed that the outrage", "was deliberately designed, and the cry for vengeance burst from the", "whole people. In full assembly, with the venerable General Matthews", "presiding, they appointed, as in the days of '76, a Committee of Safety.", "A preamble, duly setting forth the outrage on the \"Chesapeake,\" was", "adopted, and it was resolved that there should be no intercourse with", "the British frigates in the Norfolk waters, or with their agents, until", "the decision of the United States Government was known, under the", "penalty of being deemed infamous; and the Committee of Safety—", "Thomas Matthews, Thomas Newton, Jr., Luke Wheeler, Theodric", "Armistead, Richard E. Lee, Moses Myers, William Pennock, William", "Newsum, Thomas Blanchard, Daniel Bedinger, Seth Foster, J. W.", "Murdaugh, Richard Blow, and Francis S. Taylor—were authorized to", "take such measures as the emergency demanded. As soon as the British", "commander—Commodore Douglas—read the resolves, he addressed,", "on the 3d of July, an insolent letter to the Mayor of the Borough, in", "which he declared if the resolutions were not instantly annulled, he would", "prohibit every vessel bound in or out of Norfolk from proceeding to", "her place of destination. He closed his communication by saying that", "he had proceeded with his squadron of four fifty-gun frigates to Hampton", "Roads to await the answer of the Mayor, which he hoped would be", "forwarded without delay. It is thought that Mr. Tazewell had regulated", "the popular proceedings from their initiation. In the delicate dilemma,", "which was ominous of vengeful deeds and of so much menace to the", "commercial interests of Norfolk, he came to the assistance of the Mayor", "and dictated a reply to the audacious Briton which elicited the admiration", "of the whole American Nation. The letter, written on the 4th of", "The day on which this answer is written ought of itself to prove to", "the subjects of your sovereign that the American people are not to be", "imtimidated by menace; or induced to adopt any measures except by", "a sense of their perfect propriety.

In", "1820 Mr. Tazewell was one of the Commissioners under the Florida", "treaty. In 1824 he was elected to the United States Senate. He was", "elected to fill a vacancy caused by the resignation of John Taylor of", "Caroline. It is a coincidence that his father, thirty years before, was", "chosen to fill the vacancy in the Senate caused by the resignation of the", "same individual. L. W.

By the way, there is no Benjamin Fowke IV.", "Q When you were announced as the next CEO, you said there would be no major changes for Xcel. Outline what that means to you.", "A When I said that, it’s recognizing that Dick and I built a great foundation that stressed community involvement, customer orientation and environmental accomplishment.", "We’re going to ask our employees to be more involved with our stakeholders. Customer orientation means we can’t be happy until our customers are satisfied.", "We want to make investments that save our customers money over time. We have to be very diligent about listening to our customers, because they want choices.", "Q But consumers have no choice in their utility. How does choice play a part?", "A We can give them choice on how they manage their bills. They can save money by participating in our demand-side program.", "They can support more clean energy in our portfolio. There are lots of things we can do to still offer choice to our customers.", "Q What’s the challenge on the environment going forward?", "A You’ve got to understand what we did to get here. We had the repowering and retrofitting projects for our coal plants – retiring old coal plants in St. Paul and Minneapolis and replacing them with natural gas – and building our own wind farms.", "Those were astute decisions when you see the EPA rules that we’ve got. I think we are in much better shape than our peers.", "Going forward, we will work very hard in Washington and make sure our good deeds aren’t lost. We want to make sure when there is (an energy) policy that the baseline (for new regulations) isn’t moved out to the point where the wind power and environmental retrofitting we’ve done is the new baseline, because our customers have already paid for it.", "Q Xcel still gets the bulk of its electricity from coal and likely will continue to do so for years to come.", "A I think it will be difficult to build a coal plant in this country. But as you said, it will be in our portfolio for years to come.", "Fast-forward a decade, we will still have natural gas, coal, nuclear power and renewables, but coal will be a lesser part of our portfolio.", "(Xcel later provided estimates that coal will drop from providing 50 percent of Xcel’s energy today to 40 percent by 2020 for its eight-state territory, while natural gas will grow from 21 percent today to 27 percent by 2020 and renewables will become 20 percent.", "In Minnesota alone, renewables are expected to supply 30 percent of the utility’s power.)", "Q Xcel seems to groom its CEOs for succession. When did you decide you wanted to be chief executive?", "A When I was CFO, I started considering it. CFO is obviously a senior leadership position, and at some point, you start to realize you can make a contribution to the company.", "I knew I was (the board’s top pick) about a year ago, but, you know, anything can happen, and until you’re there, you’re not there.", "Q Just the other day, we saw a high-profile succession at Apple when Steve Jobs resigned as CEO. Everyone started talking about what his successor needs to do.", "What things do you need to pay attention to in this succession at Xcel?", "A My challenge is with our workforce, because half of them will retire in the next decade. The opportunity is to change the way we do our work.", "The next generation of workers is looking for different things and is not going to be as long-term, so we’ve got to work hard to simplify our processes and transfer knowledge.", "Our other challenge and opportunity are rate increases. Our plants are getting older and need to be replaced.", "Our opportunity is to do more communication with our customers and get their buy-in. Maybe the best way is with longer-range planning, such as multiple-year compacts (rate increases across several years instead of year by year) versus the more litigious way we file rate cases today.", "A We’ve got to make sure our infrastructure is refreshed over time. We also have to make investments that save customers money over time.", "One example – we will suggest wind deals that are on economic parity with natural gas.", "Q If you could advise any of the presidential candidates on energy policy, what’s the main thing you wish you could teach them?", "A I think the need is so pressing for a comprehensive and balanced approach to the environment and energy.", "We need to have a balanced portfolio of energy that takes advantage of natural gas, which we think is a clean fuel.", "We can put more into renewables. We need to have clarity on the rules so we can make the right investment decisions for tomorrow.", "I think we need to do it with economics and facts in mind, which is why we need to get rid of the rhetoric.", "Leslie Brooks Suzukamo can be reached at 651-228-5475."]}

100000 ) as compared to South African whites (40 per 100000) who consumed a typical “western’’ diet[10].", "When compared to South African blacks, American blacks exhibit a higher CRC risk and mucosal proliferation rates which is associated with higher dietary intakes of animal products and higher colonic populations of potentially toxic hydrogen and secondary bile-salt-producing bacteria[10].", "Higher consumption of animal fat including beef, pork and lamb has been associated with an increased risk for CRC[11,12].", "The consumption of red meat and pork is higher among blacks than other race-ethnicities in the United States[12].", "Some studies have suggested an inverse association between micronutrients (Vitamin E, β carotene, vitamin C, Calcium) intake and CRC risk[13,14].", "However, there are differences in the intake of micronutrients between blacks and whites with higher intake among whites primarily due to higher dietary supplements use.", "A possible basis of this association is that high concentrations of hydrogen (a byproduct of bacterial metabolism) in the colon can interfere with cellular metabolism[15].", "Hydrogen concentration has been reported to be higher among blacks than among whites[10] and hydrogen is toxic to colonic epithelium.", "Although the exact mechanisms of action of micronutrients are not well established, they are postulated to have anti-oxidant effects, exert some effect on cell growth regulation and enhance immune response.", "Although these dietary and lifestyle factors have been associated with CRC risk and may play a role in the observed disparity among blacks versus whites, the actual differential contributions of these factors to the overall CRC burden is not well established.", "For instance, while it has been suggested that high fat and low fiber diet are associated with increased susceptibility to CRC, reversal or adoption of the “healthy” lifestyle has not been proven to reduce CRC susceptibility in randomized trials.", "For instance, the adoption of low fat, high fiber, high fruits and vegetable diet in the Polyp Prevention Trial and fiber supplementation in the Wheat Bran Fiber Trial did not reduce the recurrence of adenoma[16,17].", "Similarly, weight loss within 4 years did not reduce the risk of adenoma recurrence[18].", "Furthermore, using the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System, the prevalence of these putative risk factors such as obesity, cigarette smoking, alcohol consumption, lack of physical activities, low socioeconomic status and low health literacy are comparable among blacks and Hispanic population, yet Hispanic Americans have lower burden of CRC when compared to blacks and whites in the United States[2,9].", "The incidence of CRC among Hispanic males and Hispanic females are 46.9 and 33.3 per 100000 population and the corresponding mortality rates are 15.3 and 10.2 per 100000 population.", "Blacks tend to be diagnosed with CRC at younger ages, are more likely to present with proximal tumors and be diagnosed with more advanced diseases than whites[19-26].", "This suggests that stage at presentation may account for some of the observed racial differences in survival after CRC diagnosis.", "Tumor grade is an independent prognostic predictor of CRC even after adjusting the effects of stage of disease at the time of diagnosis[3,27-31].", "Studies have suggested that blacks suffer worse outcomes when they present with similar tumor characteristics as whites.", "Alexander et al[31] reported that blacks with high grade tumors were three times (HR = 3.05, 95%CI: 1.32-7.05) more likely to die of CRC within 5 years after surgery when compared with whites with high grade tumors.", "Blacks with lymph node-negative CRC have more than 40% excess mortality when compared to whites with the same disease[5,26,27].", "It is noteworthy that approximately 30% of patients with lymph node negative CRC (stages I and II) develop recurrent disease, probably reflecting the presence of occult tumor in those lymph nodes[32-34].", "Hyslop et al[35] suggested that blacks exhibited 4-fold greater occult metastases in individual lymph nodes compared with whites.", "Thus, occult tumor burden may be playing an important role in racial disparities in CRC outcomes between blacks and whites.", "However, in a systematic review of published studies, Bach et al[36] reported that there were no appreciable differences in cancer-specific survival between blacks and whites when treatment was comparable for similar stage cancers.", "The authors concluded that differences in cancer biology between racial groups are unlikely to be responsible for a substantial portion of the observed discrepancy in stage-specific CRC survival if blacks and whites receive similar treatments.", "Blacks are more likely to be uninsured, have a fatalistic attitude towards medical illness, experience stigma, exhibit fear and denial related to a cancer diagnosis, have an aversion to health care treatments such as surgery, mistrust the healthcare system, and have misperceptions about cancer that ultimately interfere with treatment[9,37,38].", "Although the efficacy of treatment for CRC appeared to be similar between blacks and whites in equal access systems and among participants in adjuvant chemotherapy trials[21,23]", "there are differences in the treatment received after CRC diagnosis among blacks and whites in general[25,26,39-45].", "Blacks received surgery less often than whites for CRC[26,42-45]. Demissie et al[44] reported that the odds of non-receipt of surgical treatment was higher among blacks as compared with whites for stage I (OR = 2.08, 95%CI: 1.41-3.03 among males; OR = 2.38; 95%CI: 1.69-3.45 among females) and stage IV colon cancer (OR = 1.25, 95%CI: 1.01-1.56 among males; OR = 1.41, 95%CI: 1.14-1.72 among females).", "Similar results were reported by Le et al[26].

It is noteworthy that studies have reported that disparity in survival after CRC diagnosis are attenuated or eliminated with the receipt of similar treatments by blacks and whites[21,23,47,50,51].", "There has been growing evidence that CRC screening reduces mortality[52-54]. There are multiple acceptable options for CRC screening including fecal occult blood and fecal DNA testing, double contrast barium enema, CT colonography, flexible sigmoidoscopy, and colonoscopy[55].", "Identified significant predictors of CRC screening include older age, having a regular doctor and participating in general medical examinations[56].", "Screening rates are low among racial and ethnic minorities and persons from socioeconomically disadvantaged population[57-59].", "Doubeni et al[60] reported that the screening rate for white Medicare beneficiaries improved from 49% in 2000 to 56.6% in 2005.", "During the same study period, the screening rates among blacks improved from 41% to 52% suggesting that screening rates for CRC are improving, but disparity in the screening rates still persists.", "Tehranifar et al[61] also reported that cancer survival disparities between blacks and whites widened as cancers become more amenable to medical interventions.", "This suggests that blacks lag behind when medical technologies that improve cancer healthcare are introduced for reasons that are not well understood.", "Disparities in screening have been cited as one of the reasons for high incidence and mortality from CRC among blacks as compared with whites.", "Lansdorp-Vogelaar et al[62] reported that differences in CRC screening accounted for 42% of disparity in CRC incidence and 19% of disparity in CRC mortality between blacks and whites.", "There are many barriers to CRC screening uptake among blacks. These are due to a complex combination of socioeconomic disadvantages from lower education and income, place of residence, inadequate insurance and mistrust of the medical system[63-65].", "People in lower socioeconomic neighborhoods are less likely to undergo a colonoscopy, even among insured subjects receiving care in integrated healthcare systems[64].", "Physician recommendation is important for completing CRC screening[66,67]. However, increasing availability of primary care physicians and colonoscopy providers did not narrow the racial gaps in CRC screening disparities.", "Rather, colonoscopy rates increased among whites but decreased among minorities[59]. Therefore, there is an urgent need to increase the participation of minorities as care providers in biomedical fields and improve cultural competencies of all care providers[68,69].", "Although it is well known that blacks suffer the highest burden from CRC and increasing CRC screening uptake among blacks is at the core of the solution, there is no consensus regarding the screening strategy to adopt in eliminating this disparity.", "In particular, it is unclear whether there should be different CRC screening recommendations based on race-ethnicity.", "Studies have suggested that when compared to whites, blacks are more likely to be diagnosed with CRC at younger ages, present with proximal tumors and be diagnosed with advanced diseases[19-26].", "The widely adopted recommendation is to begin CRC screening from 50 years of age for average risk individuals in the United States[55,70].", "Some experts have expressed the opinion that race-based recommendation for CRC screening will create more confusion for patients and their healthcare providers amidst a crowded field of recommendations based on age, family history of colorectal cancer and polyps, and colonic diseases such as inflammatory bowel disease.", "They argue for increasing efforts to boost participation in CRC screening by blacks and that it is not cost effective to lower the age of screening[71].", "In contrast to this opinion, the American College of Physicians recommended that CRC screening should start at 40 years of age[72] while the American College of Gastroenterology (ACG)[73] and American Society for Gastrointestinal Endoscopy recommended CRC screening beginning at age 45 years[74].", "In our opinion, blacks should begin screening at age 45 years as part of a comprehensive intervention to improve screening uptake, ensure adequate follow-up and resolution of abnormal screening results, and enhance access and utilization of good quality treatment of patients diagnosed with CRC in a timely fashion.", "This is because of the well documented earlier presentation with CRC among blacks and the proximal location of their tumors which raises the possibility of genetic predisposition such as Lynch syndrome.", "However, genetic predisposition to CRC is raised based on family history of CRC. It is well known that blacks tend not to know their family medical history due to lower health literacy and lack of knowledge of their family ancestry.", "There is a lack of information among African Americans with regards to the prevalence of inherited conditions that predispose to CRC.", "Murff et al[75] reported that blacks who have first-degree relatives (FDRs) with CRC are less likely to undergo colonoscopy screening compared with whites (27.3% vs 43.1%) who have affected relatives.", "Therefore, screening blacks earlier will serve as a “reset” that has the potential of early identification of those at increased risk of CRC in the next generation.", "Future studies should focus on quantifying genetic susceptibility to CRC among blacks.", "The predisposition to proximal CRC among blacks is a potent argument to support the recommendation of the ACG that colonoscopy should be the preferred screening modality.", "Furthermore, colonoscopy is the diagnostic procedure after an abnormal screening from the other modalities and polyps can be removed during the same procedure.", "However, it is the most invasive, most expensive and presents the most difficult logistic challenge in terms of bowel preparation, co-pays, missed work days and the need for an escort due to moderate sedation.", "Studies have suggested a higher completion rate of screening when the underserved are offered fecal occult blood tests[76,77].", "It appears that there are wide geographic variations in availability of colonoscopy to the population and in the acceptability of fecal based tests to the underserved.", "We observed that blacks were less likely to undergo diagnostic colonoscopy following an abnormal flexible sigmoidoscopy screening in the Prostate, Lung, Colorectal and Ovarian Cancer Screening Trial[78].", "This raises a concern that follow-up of abnormal screening may be a challenge for blacks and a screening modality that can permit intervention may be better.", "Notwithstanding, we are of the opinion that healthcare providers should discuss CRC screening options with their patients, but should make a specific recommendation for a screening modality based on the patient’s preferences, comorbidities, social situation, and locally available resources.", "It will require a comprehensive patient, provider, and policy-maker partnership to reduce CRC disparity.", "As studies have shown that blacks who receive medical care and cancer treatment similar to those of whites experience similar outcomes, enabling blacks to achieve equal access to care as whites could substantially reduce the racial disparities in CRC burden[36].", "It is imperative to improve health insurance coverage and health education of the population. The implementation of the Affordable Care Act has a potential to ensure coverage for millions of previously uninsured persons and provide the necessary access to CRC screening.", "However, White et al[79] reported that despite the expansion of Medicare coverage for CRC screening tests, racial/ethnic differences in CRC screening persisted over time among this insured population.", "Hence, health care access by provision of health insurance is necessary but not sufficient to improve CRC screening and reduce CRC disparity by race.", "In a meta analysis by Naylor et al[80] provider-directed multi-modal interventions which comprised of education sessions and reminders and pure educational interventions were found to be effective in raising CRC screening rates in minorities by 10%-15%.", "A median improvement of 16% in endoscopic CRC screening completion was noted with the patient navigator model.", "Tailored patient education combined with patient navigation services, and physician training in communicating with patients of low health literacy, can modestly improve adherence to CRC screening.", "The New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene has started a program called The Citywide Colon Cancer Control Coalition (C5) to help New York City attain CRC control goals through advocacy, resource development, and policy initiatives.", "They launched public campaigns and implemented patient navigation systems in many of the New York City area hospitals in an effort to increase colonoscopy screening rates and reduce racial/ethnic disparities.", "In 2003, low rates of screening as well as screening disparities were noted with only 36% of blacks, 38% Latinos", "and 48% of whites having had a colonoscopy. After this concerted citywide effort, screening colonoscopy rates had increased to approximately 62 percent by 2009 with virtual elimination of screening disparities among these ethnic groups[81].", "In Delaware, a “Village approach” was implemented which involved a 3-step process to reduce CRC disparities by increasing CRC screening rates, providing quality treatment and resolution of abnormalities and by using an extensive patient navigation services.", "The program led to increased CRC screening rates among all race-ethnicities, reduction in CRC incidence, reduction in CRC mortality and narrowing of the CRC survival differences[82].", "Figure 1 shows the leading causes of CRC disparities and proffer solutions to reduce the observed disparities.", "There are several important factors contributing to differential CRC mortality rates among blacks and whites.", "A comprehensive approach that increases access and utilization of CRC screening, timely follow-up of abnormal results and treatment of CRC will be needed to reduce or eliminate disparity.", "P- Reviewers: Bloomston M, NaitoY S- Editor: Qi Y L- Editor: A E- Editor: Wu HL", "| 1. | Henschke UK, Leffall LD, Mason CH, Reinhold AW, Schneider RL, White JE.

Only in 1843, running in a newly created congressional district, was Douglas able to win a seat in the House.", "As a member of the House of Representatives, Douglas was among those urging an extension of United States territory from the Atlantic to the Pacific.", "He called for the annexation of Texas, the establishment of military posts along the Western emigrant trails, and organization of a Nebraska territorial government.", "By 1845, these and other strong expansionist positions had won Douglas the chairmanship of the House Committee on Territories.", "Through a congressional colleague, Douglas met Martha Denny Martin (1825-1853), the daughter of a wealthy North Carolina planter and a member of a family long prominent in North Carolina political affairs.", "When Stephen and Martha were married in 1847, Robert Martin offered his new son-in-law his 2,500-acre plantation on the Pearl River in Lawrence County, Mississippi.", "Douglas declined the gift, but after Martin died a year later, the Pearl River plantation was bequeathed to Martha and any children she might have.", "Douglas was designated as the property manager and was allocated 20 per cent of the plantation’s annual income for his services.", "Two children born to their marriage survived into adulthood, Robert Martin Douglas (1849-1917) and Stephen Arnold Douglas, Jr. (1850-1908).", "In 1847, after only three years in the House of Representatives, Douglas was elected by the Illinois state legislature to a seat in the U.S. Senate, where he was made chairman of the Senate Committee on Territories.", "His position gave him an influential role in shaping all aspects of national policy affecting western lands, from the courts and post office to military posts and legislative powers.", "He also became quickly immersed in growing sectional disputes over the future of slavery. As a Senator from a state with a mix of strong anti-slavery and pro-slavery sentiment, and as the manager of a Mississippi plantation with more than 100 slaves, Douglas attempted to craft a political position that would avoid favoring either the North or South.", "The first significant test of this policy, the Compromise of 1850, is usually credited to Henry Clay, but it owed a great deal to Douglas' political skills.", "To satisfy the North, California was admitted as a free state, and the slave trade was abolished in the District of Columbia; to reassure the South, the territories of New Mexico and Utah were organized without a prohibition of slavery, and a rigid fugitive slave law was enacted.", "Despite this careful attempt to placate both sides in the slavery controversy, the reaction to the Compromise in the North was immediate and hostile.", "Douglas came under fierce attack in his home state and was able to calm his supporters only by rushing back to Illinois to defend himself before the Chicago city council and the state legislature.", "In 1853, Douglas sustained a grave personal loss when his wife Martha died following complications from the birth of a daughter.", "After their infant girl also died a few weeks later, a grieving Douglas decided to leave the country for an extended tour of Europe.", "His travels took him to London, Constantinople, Moscow, St. Petersburg, and Paris, in the course of which he secured a number of diplomatic audiences and met Czar Nicholas I and Emperor Napoleon III.", "Douglas' personal life did not recover its equilibrium until 1856, when he married twenty-one-year-old Rose Adele Cutts (1835-1899), known as Adele, whose father, James Madison Cutts, was a nephew of President James Madison and Dolley Madison.", "The new Mrs. Douglas accepted Douglas' two sons as her own and raised them with his approval in her own Catholic faith.", "Their infant daughter Ellen died shortly after birth in 1859. The Douglases built an imposing townhouse in Washington just north of Capitol Hill, and it soon became renowned for lavish parties and receptions.", "Douglas' personal affairs also changed in other respects. In 1857, Douglas sold the family plantation on the Pearl River, which had been affected by flooding and poor crops, and in partnership with James A. McHatton of Baton Rouge, moved the agricultural operation to a 2,000-acre property south of Greenville, Mississippi.", "Throughout his career, Douglas maintained a strong interest in science, education, and technological improvements.", "In 1850, Douglas secured the passage of federal legislation supporting the Illinois Central Railroad route from Chicago down the Mississippi Valley to New Orleans, thus helping to make Chicago and Illinois a national center for industry and commerce.", "Douglas was an enthusiastic supporter of the Smithsonian Institution from the time of its founding and in 1854 was appointed a regent of the Smithsonian.", "In 1858 Douglas gave ten acres on the south side of Chicago to serve as the site of the newly organized University of Chicago; the land was part of his Oakenwald estate, where Douglas planned to develop an exclusive suburban neighborhood and erect his own residence.", "Douglas' rising prominence in national affairs reached a crest in January 1854, when he introduced the Kansas-Nebraska bill to organize governments in the Kansas and Nebraska territories.", "In each territory, the question of slavery would be reserved until it entered the Union as a new state; at that time, the voting citizens would draw up a constitution and determine whether or not their state would permit slavery.", "The Kansas-Nebraska bill embodied Douglas' doctrine of popular sovereignty, according to which the voters in newly admitted states, not the federal government, would determine the future of slavery by exercising their democratic rights to self-government.", "Douglas also hoped that popular sovereignty would remove slavery from congressional debate and insulate the federal government from further sectional conflict.", "The Kansas-Nebraska Act, however, unleashed a new torrent of angry protest by Northern anti-slavery forces, who felt it opened the door to an expansion of slavery across the West.", "Douglas returned to Illinois to defend his position, touring the state for two months and twice trading opposing speeches with Abraham Lincoln, a former Whig legislator and congressman who reemerged on the political stage and became a spokesman for the new Republican Party.", "In the wake of the Kansas-Nebraska Act, Douglas also found himself at odds with important elements of the national Democratic party.", "He had first attempted to gain the Democratic nomination for president in 1852. In 1856, he tried once again for the presidential nomination, but withdrew his name in favor of James Buchanan, who went on to win the election.", "The brief alliance between Buchanan and Douglas ended within a year, however, when a pro-slavery convention meeting in Lecompton, Kansas, drew up a constitution proposing statehood and protecting property in slavery.", "Buchanan supported the Lecompton constitution, but Douglas was determined to block it, arguing that its passage was fraudulent and did not express the will of the people in accordance with popular sovereignty.", "Although Douglas could not prevent congressional approval of the constitution, it was later rejected by the voters of Kansas.", "The struggle over Kansas and the spread of slavery became the dominant theme in the Senate election campaign of 1858 in Illinois.", "Douglas was renominated by the Democrats, while Abraham Lincoln was selected as the Republican candidate.", "The campaign between Douglas and Lincoln gained unexpected attention when Lincoln pressed Douglas to agree to join in a series of debates.", "Staged in seven Illinois towns from August to October of 1858, the campaign debates between Douglas and Lincoln drew large crowds and generated detailed press coverage.", "Lincoln charged that Douglas was part of a slavery \"dynasty\" seeking to promote the spread of slavery over the entire nation.", "Douglas argued that Lincoln’s \"House Divided\" speech had pushed the country to the brink of division and that popular sovereignty would resolve the slavery issue.", "On election day, the Republicans won a majority of the popular vote across the state; the Illinois legislature, however, remained in the hands of the Democrats, and Douglas was returned to Washington for another Senate term.", "Douglas and Lincoln were to meet again in the tumultuous presidential election of 1860. Divisions within the Democratic Party had become so deep that when Democrats met first in Charleston and later in Baltimore for their nominating convention, the southern delegates walked out.", "Douglas was able to win the presidential nomination from the remaining northern delegates, but the breakaway Democrats turned to John C. Breckinridge of Kentucky as their candidate.", "The Constitutional Union party nominated John Bell of Tennessee, and the Republicans chose Abraham Lincoln to carry their banner, making the 1860 presidential election a four-way race.", "Douglas was so concerned about the sectional division in the Democratic party and the potential rupture of the federal Union that he decided to break with precedent and campaign on his own behalf, the first presidential candidate in American history to do so.", "Frequently accompanied by Adele, Douglas campaigned through all parts of the country, from New England, New York, and Pennsylvania to Virginia, Tennessee, Alabama, and Georgia.", "His desperate efforts to reunite the Democratic party, however, could not overcome the rapidly disintegrating political situation.", "In November 1860, none of the four presidential candidates secured a majority of the popular vote, but Abraham Lincoln carried the electoral college and won the White House.", "In the months following the presidential election, Douglas returned to Washington to join the efforts to prevent the secession of the southern states, engaging in a series of private meetings with Lincoln to map strategy.", "When the Illinois state legislature went into special session, Douglas traveled to Springfield to make an impassioned speech rallying citizens to a defense of the Union.", "Several weeks later, while staying the Tremont House hotel in Chicago, Douglas fell ill, and his condition soon began to deteriorate.", "On June 3, 1861, with his wife, Adele, at his side, he died.", "The funeral of Stephen A. Douglas was attended by more than 5,000 mourners. His body was laid to rest in a temporary tomb overlooking Lake Michigan, on the Oakenwald property that he had selected for his Chicago residence.", "In 1881, a permanent monument was erected on the site; its designer was Leonard W. Volk, whose wife was a cousin of Douglas and whose education as an artist had been sponsored by Douglas.", "The Civil War had immediate and devastating effects on Douglas family estate. In 1862, Camp Douglas, a Union military prison, was established at the northern end of the Oakenwald property; it housed more than 26,000 captured Confederate soldiers, of which 6,000 died.", "The Douglas mansion in Washington was turned over to the Federal government, and it was converted into a military hospital for the duration of the conflict.", "In Mississippi, the Greenville plantation was raided by Union troops, and the entire cotton crop was lost.", "Douglas' two sons later attempted to recover compensation from the federal government, but without success.", "After the war, Robert Martin Douglas graduated from Georgetown College, served as private secretary to President Ulysses S. Grant, and became a justice of the North Carolina Supreme Court.", "Stephen A. Douglas, Jr., who also studied at Georgetown, moved from North Carolina to Chicago and became an attorney.", "Adele Cutts Douglas remarried in 1866 to Brevet Brigadier General Robert Williams, who later became Adjutant General of the U.S. Army; they had six children.", "The Stephen A. Douglas collection is organized into seven series: Series I: Senate and Constituent Correspondence; Series II: Political; Series III: Personal; Series IV: Financial and Legal; Series V: Artifacts and Ephemera; Series VI: Oversized; and Series VII: Books.", "The largest portion of the collection is housed in Series I. This series contains the incoming correspondence of senators and constituents contemporary to Stephen A. Douglas, arranged chronologically from 1800 to 1867.", "Correspondence with unknown dates has been arranged alphabetically by the name signed and is located at the end of this series.", "Douglas' name has been abbreviated as SAD within Series I.", "Series II consists of materials pertaining to Douglas' political career.

https://www.iea.org/reports/energy-efficiency-2020, Licence: CC BY 4.0", "This section focuses on energy efficiency policy announcements made in response to the Covid-19 crisis to the end of October 2020, including changes to regulation and government funding announcements.", "In addition, it discusses some policies that are not targeted at efficiency but may have an impact on it, such as energy bill relief for households and businesses.", "Energy efficiency: At the heart of a sustainable recovery", "The IEA Sustainable Recovery Plan shows how the world can maintain and create jobs, boost economic growth and improve energy sustainability and resilience in the energy sector in the wake of the Covid-19 crisis.", "Energy efficiency action (including investments in transport and urban infrastructure)1 comprises the largest component of the plan, more than half of the proposed USD 1 trillion in public and private investment in each of the next three years.", "Investing in efficiency is central to the plan because many energy-efficient products and services are cost-effective and existing programmes can be ramped up in the near term.", "In addition, energy efficiency projects are labour-intensive, meaning for every dollar spent, a large amount goes into labour, helping to maintain existing jobs and create new jobs quickly.", "In some sectors, where skills barriers are minimal, energy efficiency investments can also provide employment for displaced workers.", "Most of the investment in energy efficiency results in energy savings and therefore monetary savings.", "Crucially, this means the cost per tonne of greenhouse gas emissions abated is often negative, as shown below under the modelled abatement of the measures in the Sustainable Recovery Plan.", "Cost of abatement and emissions avoided as a result of selected Sustainable Recovery Plan measures, by category", "OpenSpending on efficiency is becoming a large part of governments’ clean energy stimulus spending", "While many governments’ economic relief and stimulus announcements are still being formulated, around USD 114 billion of public spending in the energy sector announced to the end of October 2020 is being allocated to measures considered as “clean energy stimulus”.2", "In addition to the spending announcements analysed here, governments are also proposing support for the energy sector via regulatory changes, tax breaks or pauses on levies and royalties, and purchase of debt or equity.", "Around 58% of public clean energy stimulus spending announced to the end of October 2020, totalling USD 66 billion, has been allocated to energy efficiency-related measures.", "The announced efficiency-related stimulus has the potential to create 5 million energy efficiency job-years,3 when factoring in leveraged private investment (see also Energy efficiency jobs and the recovery).", "Announced public clean energy stimulus spending by category*", "Announced public efficiency-related stimulus funding by measure to end of October 2020", "OpenCurrent spending announcements are unevenly spread between sectors and regions", "Building retrofits and electric vehicles dominate efficiency-related stimulus spending", "Of the USD 66 billion in public stimulus spending on efficiency-related measures announced to the end of October, USD 26 billion are dedicated to building retrofits.", "However, limited spending has been announced on high efficiency or near zero energy new buildings.", "Around USD 13.5 billion has been announced to help accelerate the shift to electric vehicles, with a further USD 7 billion allocated to electric vehicle charging networks in funds allocated to urban infrastructure.", "In contrast, less than USD 1.5 billion has been announced for new efficient internal combustion engine vehicles.", "In contrast to buildings, no spending has been announced to stimulate the purchase of energy-efficient appliances that exceed minimum energy performance standards.", "Economic stimulus announcements comprise just USD 3.0 billion for industrial energy efficiency globally, and less than USD 1.3 billion for new efficient vehicles, despite the significant opportunities that exist for efficiency gains in these sectors.", "Of the USD 12.5 billion of efficiency spending announced for urban infrastructure, a large proportion has been allocated for new cycling infrastructure, as governments seek to bolster the use of active transport to replace public transport use in the wake of the pandemic.", "For example, the United Kingdom has committed to invest around USD 2.5 billion in active transport with new and improved cycling infrastructure, the Canada Healthy Communities Initiative commits USD 22.7 million to a range of initiatives including those that support walking and cycling, and in the Greater Paris Region, France has committed over USD 330 million to create up to 680 kilometres of cycleways.", "European governments have announced the vast majority of stimulus spending on efficiency, other regions lagging", "European governments have been the most active in announcing support for efficiency-related measures.", "Around USD 57 billion of spending proposals (or 86% of global stimulus announcements for efficiency) has been announced by European governments to the end of October, with the remaining 14% split between Asia Pacific and North America.", "Of European announcements, the largest are from France, Germany and Italy.", "In contrast, only very small amounts of energy efficiency spending have been announced in Latin America and no major announcements recorded in Africa.", "Announced public energy efficiency stimulus funding by region to end of October 2020", "OpenIn addition to announcements made at the country level, the European Union has announced a EUR 750 billion (USD 840 billion) stimulus package, of which roughly one-third has been allocated to climate action.", "If spending follows similar patterns to past EU spending, around EUR 190 billion (USD 209 billion) of this package could flow to energy efficiency, which would increase public stimulus spending on efficiency by a factor of four.", "Spending announcements for efficiency are not yet at the level outlined in the IEA Sustainable Recovery Plan", "Public stimulus support for efficiency announced to the end of October, and the estimated private funds that could be leveraged, are below the levels of potential investment opportunities identified in the IEA recovery pathway.4 In certain areas, such as appliances and new efficient cars, there have been few stimulus announcements, compared with the opportunity identified in the IEA Sustainable Recovery Plan.", "Estimated public and private investments from stimulus announcements to date for clean energy by efficiency measure compared with the IEA Sustainable Recovery Scenario to end of October 2020", "OpenEstimated public and private investments from stimulus announcements for clean energy by category compared with the IEA Sustainable Recovery Plan to end of October 2020", "On 21 July 2020, EU leaders agreed to spend EUR 750 billion (USD 840 billion) on the economic recovery over the next three years while ensuring that their economies undertake the green and digital transitions.", "Around 37% of this EU funding is earmarked for climate action to support the European Green Deal and contribute to achieving the European Union’s new 2030 climate targets, which will be updated by the end of the year.", "Based on current proposals by the European Commission and past funding patterns, around EUR 190 billion (USD 209 billion) of the recovery plan could be allocated to energy efficiency-related measures.5", "A large part of it will focus on buildings, supporting the Renovation Wave for Europe published on 14 October 2020, and the investment opportunity and job creation potential it offers, by at least doubling the renovation rate and retrofitting 35 million building units by 2030.", "Overall, the efficiency investments would significantly exceed the stimulus pathway outlined for Europe in the IEA Sustainable Recovery Plan, especially when taking into account additional clean energy stimulus investments by EU member states.", "Policy decisions made during the crisis will steer energy efficiency progress", "As governments respond to the economic crisis, policy action to stimulate energy efficiency sector growth and jobs could help to accelerate energy efficiency progress beyond pre-pandemic levels.", "In response to the anomalous energy consumption and emissions data that 2020 is likely to produce, however, some governments have reduced ambitions for energy intensity improvement targets for periods that include 2020.", "Several governments have also delayed the introduction of new minimum energy performance standards or star ratings for appliances, vehicle fuel-efficiency standards and building energy performance codes.", "Delaying policy, and deferring or weakening planned changes to energy efficiency regulations, could slow energy efficiency progress.", "At the same time, economic stimulus packages that do not build energy efficiency into spending and programmes risk locking in higher energy use and bills in buildings, appliances and vehicles for decades to come.", "Utility-funded energy efficiency programmes are evolving to address the Covid-19 crisis", "Utility-funded programmes are now a widespread tool for improving energy efficiency globally. In Canada and the United States, combined spending on utility‑funded energy efficiency and demand response programmes totalled almost USD 9 billion in 2017.", "As of 2020, there are 49 utility-funded energy efficiency programmes in 24 countries (Croatia launched new energy efficiency obligations in 2019 and Cyprus in 2020).6", "The Covid-19 crisis has slowed the implementation of energy efficiency measures under utility-funded programmes and forced adjustments to programmes to help utilities and other programme participants adapt to the health crisis.", "In Australia, the New South Wales Energy Savings Scheme administrator has provided case by case concessions and flexibility to both obligated parties and participating energy efficiency service providers due to Covid-19 impacts.", "These include extensions to reporting dates, and dates to meet obligations or pay penalties, as well as extensions to audit due dates.", "The Victorian Energy Upgrades Program has also made adjustments due to Covid‑19 lockdowns, restricting eligible upgrades to critical repair activities, such as to space and water heating systems.", "In Europe, Italy’s white certificate scheme has also made allowances due to the crisis, with a proposed extension to deadlines for the 2019 compliance year.", "France’s white certificate scheme has made similar concessions, including a six-month extension to the time limit on creating certificates for completed activities, a 12-month extension on certificate multipliers for heating and insulation upgrades, and the introduction of new multipliers to help non-residential buildings upgrade away from fossil fuel heating.", "In the United States, policy makers are also adapting to the impact of the crisis. The Michigan Public Service Commission has recommended rolling the 2020 and 2021 energy utility-funded programme targets into one, to maintain the programme’s energy efficiency targets while providing some flexibility due to the disruption in 2020.", "In Colorado, Xcel Energy’s utility energy efficiency and demand management programmes are set to go ahead in 2021 and 2022 with investment and energy savings targets higher than those in 2019 and 2020.", "Further details on the challenges and solutions for utility-funded energy efficiency programmes during the Covid-19 pandemic and recovery can be found in the IEA article published in August 2020.", "Energy bill relief is often being delivered alongside efficiency stimulus", "Several governments have introduced measures to defer energy bills or provide other support for vulnerable households as the pandemic pushes down their incomes and increases their risk of energy poverty.", "To the end of October 2020, governments had announced around USD 13.7 billion in support for consumers to manage higher energy bills.", "In Indonesia, for example, 24 million low-income households have been offered free electricity for six months, while 7 million additional households have benefitted from electricity bill discounts.", "Alongside bill relief packages, some countries are also announcing energy efficiency spending. Stimulus spending on building renovation programmes has been announced in Canada (USD 220 million), France (USD 7.7 billion) and Germany (USD 2.2 billion).", "Over time, these investments in energy efficiency will provide ongoing bill relief while creating jobs and delivering economic, health and environmental benefits.", "How do stimulus policy announcements compare with the Recommendations of the Commission for Urgent Action on Energy Efficiency?", "In response to a global slowdown in energy efficiency improvement, the IEA executive director convened an independent high-level commission in June 2018 to examine how progress on energy efficiency could be accelerated through new and stronger policy action.", "The 23-member Global Commission for Urgent Action on Energy Efficiency was composed of current and former national leaders, ministers, chief executives and global thought leaders.", "Members of the commission worked together to produce a set of 10 recommendations – finalised during the Covid-19 crisis – to encourage governments to implement more ambitious energy efficiency actions.", "Several of the recommendations were intended to encourage governments to deploy energy efficiency measures for their short-term economic stimulus benefits and their contribution to achieving long-term clean energy transitions.", "Several governments are taking action to make policy consistent with the recommendations. Germany’s stimulus policy package shows a strong focus on building renovation, expanding a pre-existing mechanism – the CO2 Building Renovation Programme – by an additional EUR 1 billion.", "This step will help to unlock the job creation potential of buildings sector energy efficiency (Recommendation 2), a sector that tends to be particularly labour-intensive.", "Similarly, Italy has supercharged the Eco Bonus programme to provide 110% tax incentives from 1 July 2020 to 31 December 2021 for energy efficiency building renovations, installation of rooftop solar PV, and electric vehicle charging stations.", "Spain’s Law on Climate Change and Energy Transition, approved in May 2020, sets out a long-term vision and policy framework to achieve carbon neutrality by 2050.", "The law puts energy efficiency at the heart of Spain’s cross-governmental climate action, committing to improve efficiency and reduce primary energy consumption by at least 35% by 2030 (Recommendations 1 and 10).", "It focuses strongly on building renovation, adding to Spain’s existing long-term strategy for energy rehabilitation in the buildings sector (Recommendation 2).", "Under the law, the national government will closely collaborate with municipalities to expand more efficient and clean modes of transport in key urban areas, including by establishing low-emission zones no later than 2023 and investing in alternative mobility infrastructure (Recommendation 7).", "Canada’s recent announcement that will step up its Community Efficiency Financing Initiative creates more opportunities for municipalities and sub-national partners to take stronger efficiency action (Recommendation 7).", "The new USD 300 million fund supports municipalities’ financing programmes for home energy performance upgrades, which have proven to be effective in overcoming barriers such as access to capital or uncertainty about the cost and quality of retrofits, while creating local jobs and reducing emissions.", "China’s new policy for supporting private energy conservation, announced in July 2020, sharply focuses on scaling up private sector efficiency investment through a range of financial instruments (Recommendations 3 and 4).", "Preferential tax incentives create opportunities for more efficient use of energy and water resources among businesses, while the policy strongly encourages financial institutions to incorporate efficiency criteria in their finance services.", "Sub-national governments play a key role in implementing and monitoring these measures (Recommendation 7).", "Beyond emergency stimulus, efficiency measures have continued", "While energy policy makers have turned their attention to the Covid-19 crisis, they have also continued to implement policies and regulation planned before the crisis, which could magnify the impact of new announcements.", "Policy changes that have proceeded as planned in 2020 include:", "- The Australian Energy Market Commission released its final determination on a new rule for wholesale demand response mechanism.", "Under the rule, large industrial and commercial consumers will be able to sell demand response in the wholesale electricity market either directly or through aggregators (demand response service providers) for the first time, starting in late 2021.", "- Brazil launched a new Procel Lab Programme to help startups develop new energy-efficient solutions.", "The Brazilian Electricity Regulator also announced a new website to publish data from Brazil’s Energy Efficiency Obligation Programme.", "- China is implementing its Green and High-Efficiency Cooling Action Plan, released in 2019.

With its history of populist, progressive politics, it is probably less surprising than one might think that Minnesota has emerged as a solar market leader in the Midwest.", "In 2013, the state passed wide-ranging solar legislation requiring investor-owned utilities to generate 1.5 percent of their power from solar by 2020, with 10 percent of that amount to be produced from systems of 20 kilowatts (kW) or less.", "Initial estimates projected that this solar energy standard alone would increase the Minnesota’s solar capacity from 13 megawatts (MW) to more than 450 MW, an exponential growth in development for a Midwest state.", "Other policies in the legislation were aimed at spurring the growth of distributed solar for the consumer market.", "Tri-County Electric Cooperative’s Renewable Rays community solar project in Rushford, Minnesota. —Net Metering: The law expanded incentives for new net-metered customers and, specifically, opened the way for more commercial installations by raising the upper limit for net-metered systems from 40 kW to 1 MW.", "—Community Solar: It also established a framework for new community solar programs, particularly for customers in Xcel Energy’s service territory.", "—Value of Solar: The law also called for the Minnesota Department of Commerce to establish a methodology for calculating a new “value of solar” rate to be used as an alternative to net metering for compensating solar customers for excess power they produce.", "Minnesota is also one of the states, along with California, Hawaii and New York, currently grappling with transformation of its energy markets through a collaborative process — here called the e21 Initiative.", "However, in this blog, I will focus primarily on the impacts of the 2013 solar legislation. Different solar options, different outcomes Prior to 2013, Minnesota consumers had only one distributed solar option — installing and owning solar panels with excess generation compensated through net metering at retail rates.", "The size of net-metered systems was limited to 40 kW, a capacity that provided plenty of room for homeowners, but put a notable ceiling on the commercial market.", "Third-party solar leases weren’t available. One utility, the Wright-Hennepin Cooperative Electric Association, had a 40-kW community solar program.", "Passed in May 2013, the impact of the new law was immediate. By the end of the year, Minnesota had close to 1,200 solar installations, totalling about 10.5 MW of net-metered solar.", "The majority of these systems were connected to Xcel Energy‘s distribution system. Xcel is one of the state’s primary investor-owned electric utilities.", "Now, two years later, the law’s impact has been more mixed, with each of its key solar provisions taking markedly different paths.", "Net Metering In addition to the higher cap on the size of net-metered systems, the 2013 law offered new incentives for customers of investor-owned utilities, which fund the state-run program.", "Managed by the state Department of Commerce, the “Made in Minnesota” (MiM) program, currently provides between 25 cents and 37 cents per kilowatt-hour (kWh) per year for 10 years for electricity produced by solar panels manufactured in-state.", "For example, a 3-kW system with an incentive of 27 cents/kWh would receive around $1,083 per year for ten years, depending on actual performance — more than double what a consumer would save on their electric bill each year with net metering.", "Outside of the state program, Xcel also operates a less generous “overflow” incentive program for customers who don’t opt for the MiM program, while Minnesota Power also operates a supplemental rebate program that adds to what is received from MiM. Seven municipal utilities also offer solar rebates.", "As a result of these changes, the net-metered solar capacity in the state grew almost 50 percent in 2014, adding about 5 MW, particularly in small commercial installations.", "With similar growth expected by the end of 2015, the market has doubled in just two years. However, the market expansion is not without complications.", "Participants in the MiM program are chosen in a yearly lottery, with a lengthy waiting list of those not selected.", "In 2015, the state received 1,043 applications, with only 429 applications selected to receive the incentive.", "In addition, MiM incentive levels vary between the state’s four solar manufacturers, which has r"]}

The initial tax credit of 1.5 cents per kilowatthour (1992 dollars) for the first 10 years of output from plants entering service by December 31, 1999, included an annual adjustment for inflation and is currently valued at 2.2 cents per kilowatthour (2011 dollars).", "Although amendments to the original law have expanded it to a wide variety of renewable resources and technologies, the original PTC applied to generation from tax-paying owners of new wind plants, as well as eligible biomass power plants.", "In its early years, the PTC had little discernible effect on the industries it was designed to support.", "By 1999, when the provision was originally set to expire, U.S. wind capacity had begun growing again, and the PTC supported the development of more than 500 megawatts of new wind capacity in California, Iowa, Minnesota, and other states that had implemented policies to support or require renewable generation capacity.", "State-level programs encouraged wind power development. For example, the mandate in Minnesota for 425 megawatts of wind power by 2003 was part of a settlement with Northern States Power (now Xcel Energy) to extend on-site storage of nuclear waste at its nuclear facility.", "In 1999, Texas became the first state to implement a renewable portfolio standard (RPS) for a competitive electricity supply market.", "Cycles of expiration and reauthorization. From 1999 to 2004, Congress allowed the PTC to expire three times, each time retroactively extending it several months after the expiration deadline had passed.", "The two-year cycle of expiration and re-extension is apparent (see chart, starting in 1999). In the 12-month period immediately prior to the expiration dates (which, after 1999, were always pegged to the last day of the calendar year), new installations reached high levels as developers rushed to beat the legislative deadline, followed by a substantial retrenchment in the following year as the status of the tax credit was sorted out.", "Congress has not allowed the PTC to expire since passage of the Working Families Tax Relief Act of 2004.", "In the period from 2005 to 2010, the wind industry experienced a period of consistent year-over-year growth.", "This growth occurred as the number of states with renewable power requirements increased.", "Recession and recovery. The break in this growth streak occurred in 2010, as an echo effect of the financial crisis and recession from late 2008 and 2009.", "While wind projects were still eligible for tax credits, a lack of investors with sufficient tax appetite, or tax-situation ability to take advantage of the credits, a general decline in the need for new sources of generation, and a decline in natural gas prices that hurt the competitiveness of wind on a cost basis all contributed to slower growth for wind capacity in 2010.", "In 2009, as part of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA), Congress modified the PTC to address the tax appetite issue.", "In particular, the ITC was reintroduced for wind and other PTC-eligible technologies at a 30% level. In addition, projects starting construction before the end of 2011 may elect to receive an equivalent-value cash grant in lieu of the ITC (known as a 1603 Grant after its ARRA section number), thus mitigating the need for investors with sufficient tax burdens to be offset by the ITC.", "Recent events. In 2011, wind power construction began to rebound from the 2010 retrenchment, largely with projects taking advantage of the 1603 Grant before its expiration.", "The trend has continued through 2012, with approximately 6 GW of new installations through October and another 6 GW expected to enter service in the last months of the year, as reported to EIA by project developers.", "If all reported capacity installations are completed as reported to EIA, 2012 would again set a record for new wind installations in the United States.", "In 2011, installed wind capacity stood at more than 45 GW, and generated almost 120 million megawatthours of electricity, accounting for about 4% of U.S. installed capacity and 3% of total U.S. generation in 2011.", "Currently, the PTC is scheduled to expire for new wind generators entering service after the end of 2012.", "Other PTC-eligible technologies may continue to receive this tax credit for facilities that begin operation during 2013.", "Eligibility of these projects for the ITC will expire at the same time as eligibility for the PTC (end of 2012 for wind, end of 2013 for other PTC-eligible technologies).", "Projects that were under construction before the end of 2011 will still be eligible for a 1603 Grant, as long as they enter service prior to expiration of the PTC or ITC for their technology class."]}

Russia is dealing with an ongoing demographic crisis even as foreign and domestic investors have lost trust in its potential for growth.", "As with earlier iterations, the fourth industrial revolution is developing from the convergence of multiple technologies.", "Despite the shorthand sometimes used to identify the three previous revolutions—steam, electricity, digital—none was driven by a single technology.1 Each needed a merging of numerous new technologies alongside relevant economic, social, and political change before it could evolve.", "In The Fourth Industrial Revolution, Klaus Schwab states that the unifying of new technologies—“artificial intelligence [AI], robotics, internet of things, autonomous vehicles, 3D printing, nanotechnology, biotechnology, material science, energy storage, and quantum computing, to name a few”2—is going to revolutionize almost every aspect of life, mostly in a positive way.", "But when discussing the fourth industrial revolution’s impact on international security, he was concerned that the technologies will provide much greater power to nonstate actors and create instability in many regions.", "Therefore, the fourth industrial revolution is a critical factor in the emerging era of Great Power competition (GPC) headlined in 2020 by the United States, China, and Russia.", "In this chapter, we do not attempt to deal with all the technologies driving the fourth industrial revolution; instead, we focus only on those that will most directly impact GPC, economic potential, and international trade in the short term: robotics, AI, 3D printing, energy, and biotechnology.", "The chapter also considers two important factors essential to U.S. efforts to exploit new technologies: current immigration policy and research and development (R&D) investments.", "Although we discuss each of these technologies individually, it is the combination of them in new ways that will revolutionize the global economy.", "For instance, the first industrial revolution is often referred to as steam driven, but steam had to be combined with improved steel production, new manufacturing techniques, the telegraph, and other technologies both new and old to create the railroads that revolutionized trade and production.", "While space limitations forced us to select only a few of the technologies driving today’s revolution, readers should keep in mind that the others are essential to enabling the chosen technologies (for instance, advances in material science are essential to advances in the chosen technologies).", "Robotics covers a vast field that will fundamentally alter how humans do things—from in the deep sea to outer space.", "We start by examining industrial robots and then move on to collaborative robots.", "General Motors purchased its first industrial robots in 1961. Since then, robots have steadily evolved with improvements in degrees of freedom, range of motion, strength, speed, reliability, accuracy, and repeatability.", "Industrial robots’ increasing flexibility and effectiveness are resulting in rapid and steady growth of sales.", "Sales averaged 115,000 per year from 2005 to 2008 but increased to 422,000 by 2018.3", "Sales keep growing because robots dramatically improve productivity. The U.S. steel industry offers a prime example.", "From 1962 to 2005, it shed 75 percent of its workforce, but its shipment of steel products in 2005 equaled that of the early 1960s.", "Robots increased output per worker by a factor of five. Despite the massive shedding of jobs in the industry, steel manufacturing has been one of the fastest growing industries in the past three decades, behind only computer software and equipment.4", "New sensors and improved mechanics mean industrial robots are becoming cost effective even in high-tech industries.", "China’s Changying Precision Technology Company has automated its mobile phone production lines and cut factory personnel from 650 to just 60 while increasing productivity by 250 percent.5", "Although perhaps an extreme example, this type of streamlining is driving chief executive officers to explore how industrial robots can improve their companies’ competitiveness.", "Robots tasked with routine computer electronics assembly cost about $7.25 per hour to operate, and the purchase cost of robots is expected to come down 22 percent by 2025, even as these machines become easier to integrate into current operations.6 In 2020, Chinese labor costs $6.50 per hour.7", "Products with potential for even greater growth—and hence greater impact on many aspects of life—are collaborative robots, or cobots.", "Unlike industrial robots, which must be separated from humans for safety, cobots are specifically designed to work in collaboration with people.", "And unlike industrial robots, which are expensive and have limited flexibility, cobots are cheap and flexible.", "Designed to be mobile, they are easy to be moved to different locations and assigned new tasks. They are already working in homes, laboratories, hospitals, nursing homes, warehouses, farms, and distributions centers to tend, test, carry, assemble, package, pick, place, count, secure, and inspect.8", "They are even being used as exoskeletons to provide strength and protection to people. And unlike most large industrial robots, cobots are relatively easy to upgrade.9", "In 2019, basic cobots cost about $24,000.10 Assuming a 40-hour workweek and 3-year lifespan, this works out to approximately $4 an hour—well below U.S. labor costs and competitive with wages in emerging economies.", "And if a plant is running with three shifts, the hourly cost is about $1.35—well below even most emerging economy wages.", "Of course, robots need no medical, retirement, or leave benefits. Just as important, cobots are easily programmable.", "In fact, a “non-technical person can teach what to do through arm movement and simple button presses, and can master a new task in half an hour or so.", "There is also little assembly or setup required.”11 Moreover, the low prices, minimal technical support required, and flexibility mean that many of the 6 million small and medium enterprises worldwide will buy cobots.", "Goldman Sachs notes that today’s versions have a payback period as short as 6 months.12 ABI Research predicts global revenue from cobots will “grow at an annual rate of 49.9 percent between 2016 and 2025 compared to 12.1 percent for industrial robots.", "Even as costs of cobots come down quickly, their capabilities are growing at an exceptional rate. In 2012, the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency awarded a $1.3-million grant to develop a robot that could sew.", "Inevitably nicknamed “sewbots,” these systems are mastering the complex task of sewing—and thus are threatening to disrupt the global clothing industry.", "The field of robotics seems to have reached the knee of its exponential growth curve—the point at which the curve turns vertical.", "From heavy-duty industrial robots to small personal robots, the range of capabilities is expanding rapidly even as cost drops and ease of use improves.", "By eliminating any labor-cost advantage to production in low-cost regions, robots are, and will continue to be, central to the return of production to home markets.", "Even as industry masters the mechanical aspects of robotics, key advances are being made in the field of AI, which will further enhance the advantages robots provide in production.", "AI will play the role electricity did in the second industrial revolution, when the world moved from steam to electrical power; it will be an integral part of every new technology.", "From task-specific AI that autonomously executes a job such as controlling a mining truck in an open pit to more powerful AI that assists with complex planning, analysis, and decisionmaking, this technology will be essential.", "Unfortunately, the term artificial intelligence causes considerable confusion. Much of the current discussion concerns artificial general intelligence (AGI), which itself boasts a range of different definitions.", "In fact, there is a great deal of disagreement in the AI research community as to when or even if AGI is achievable.", "However, this chapter focuses on how limited, or task-specific, AI is rapidly improving productivity.", "Task-specific AI is essentially a machine operating with a set of guidelines to accomplish chores. Although such a system will provide great practical capabilities in its specific field, it will not be capable of fully independent operation.", "Task-specific AI-driven robots are executing manual tasks in virtually every field of human endeavor, but AI is not limited to physical work.", "In January 2017, Japanese insurance company Fukoku Mutual Life Insurance replaced 34 insurance claim workers with software from IBM Watson Explorer.", "The software scans hospital records and other documents to determine insurance payouts, factoring in the specific injuries, each patient’s medical history, and the procedures administered.", "Fukoku Mutual reportedly spent $1.7 million (200 million yen) to install the AI system, and now pays $128,000 per year for maintenance.", "By using the software, the firm saves roughly $1.1 million per year on employee salaries—meaning it hopes to see a return on the investment in less than 2 years.14", "This kind of breakthrough acts as a major incentive for other firms to follow suit—simply to remain competitive in their industries.", "The result has been a steady return of service industries to their home countries as AI takes over many of the back-office tasks, such as computer programming, bookkeeping, handling insurance adjustments, and manning call centers, that used to be contracted to firms in India or the Philippines.", "Another form of AI can develop optimal designs for a wide variety of structures. Autodesk’s “Dreamcatcher system allows designers to input specific design objectives, including functional requirements, material type, manufacturing method, performance criteria, and cost restrictions.", "”15 But the improved designs often cannot be produced using conventional manufacturing techniques,16 thus the need for another emerging technology: 3D printing.", "The first 3D-printing patent was granted in 1986. Slow speeds and uneven finishes meant that 3D printing was initially used mainly to produce prototypes and a limited number of unique low-volume products.", "But in the past decade, it has transformed from an industry focused on prototyping to one engaged in creating a wide range of products.", "In addition to increasing the speed of printing and refining the finishes, a great deal of effort has gone into expanding the number of materials that can be used.", "More exciting, 3D manufacturing is rapidly developing entirely new materials: “up to 140 different digital materials can be realized from combining the existing primary materials in different ways.", "”17 3D printing is quite literally changing what can be made.", "Meanwhile, researchers and 3D-printing companies continue to pursue both versatility and speed. Multimaterial printers were one of the big steps in this effort.", "Instead of printing a series of pieces that then must be assembled, the multimaterial machine forms the assembly in one go.", "As businesses learn to use these multimaterial printers, the range of products they will be able to print will expand exponentially.", "Furthermore, 3D printing’s efficiency is unmatched: Its material wastage is near zero.", "The range of products—from medical devices and aircraft parts to buildings and bridges—and the order of magnitude increase in the speed of printing are already challenging traditional manufacturing.18 Better printing speeds mean that 3D printing has moved beyond prototyping and high-value parts.", "In April 2016, Carbon3D released a commercial printer that was 100 times faster than existing printers.", "Such improvements allowed 3D printing to capture 20 percent of the global plastics manufacturing market in 2016.19 Not to be outdone, metal printers have combined high speed and low cost to make them a system of choice even for mass production of small parts.", "The fact that key patents are expiring soon will further accelerate enhancements in printer capabilities and capacities.20", "3D printing opens up the possibility of a totally different supply chain, one that runs with lower costs and a smaller carbon footprint.", "The materials and energy required for manufacturers to create new parts will be harnessed into electronic design files that can be printed on demand anywhere in the world.", "In these new transformative supply chains, many spare parts may not even need to exist, which could translate into huge savings on warehousing costs.21", "3D printing is revolutionizing manufacturing in many industries. The ability to change each product by changing the software means the era of mass customization and local production is on us.", "No longer will parts have to be shipped across oceans and then trucked to the user; they will be printed on site.", "3D printing is clearly on the path to causing major disruptions in global supply chains.", "Energy, in the form of petroleum, natural gas, and coal, has been a key component of global trade for the past half-century, but the influence of petroleum on both global trade and national security may be waning.", "Rapid advances in energy technology are changing the world’s energy markets—and in many cases moving energy sources from overseas companies to locally produced oil, gas, and renewables.", "In its World Energy Outlook 2017, the International Energy Agency stated, “Four large-scale shifts in the global energy system set the scene for the World Energy Outlook 2017: the rapid deployment and falling costs of clean energy technologies, the growing electrification of energy, the shift to a more services-oriented economy and a cleaner energy mix in China, and the resilience of shale gas and tight oil in the United States.”22", "The U.S. fracking revolution is driving a global increase in demand for natural gas, even as oil use may have peaked.", "In November 2016, the Wall Street Journal ran a front-page article reporting that global oil producers such as Royal Dutch Shell and even state-owned Saudi Aramco anticipate that the world has reached peak oil usage and are preparing for a future decline in demand.23", "U.S. shale oil production (fracking) has been the fastest growing source of oil globally. In 2012, the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) estimated that shale oil production could reach 2.8 million barrels per day (bpd) by 2035; it did so by 2013.24 In late November 2014, the EIA predicted the United States would become the world’s largest oil producer by 2020.25", "Perhaps the most powerful aspect of U.S. shale oil operations is the speed with which they can be closed or reopened in response to demand.", "From October 2016 to January 2017, U.S. crude production increased 500,000 bpd in response to the West Texas Intermediate (WTI) price increasing from $45 to $50 a barrel.27", "The combination of the novel coronavirus pandemic and the short-term Saudi-Russian “oil wars” resulted in a collapse in the price of oil to less than $20 a barrel.", "Even the April 2020 tentative pact between Russia and Saudi Arabia did not result in major price increases.", "In mid-April 2020, The Economist predicted that oil prices will remain low as the oil industry restructures post-pandemic.28 Although price spikes will still occur during times of crisis, U.S. shale oil supplies may well ensure that the WTI price will not exceed $60 a barrel (in 2018 dollars).", "Even the September 14, 2019, attack on Saudi oil facilities resulted in only a few days’ increase to the mid-$60s before WTI returned to the mid-$50s.", "Fracking has also created a natural gas boom in the United States. As recently as 2007, U.S. companies were racing to build liquid natural gas (LNG) import facilities.", "The demand for natural gas was growing quickly, and U.S. production was falling. In October 2005, the Henry Hub (U.S.) spot price rose to $13.42 per million British thermal units (MBTU).", "Then the fracking revolution occurred, which forced a massive drop in price to $1.93 per MBTU by December 2015—a reduction of 85 percent (see figure).", "Suddenly companies were applying for permits to turn their LNG import facilities into LNG export facilities.", "As late as 2005, those U.S. industries that made heavy use of natural gas for their products (for instance, the petrochemical industry) or to generate energy for production were at a disadvantage in global competition.", "U.S. companies paid significantly more for this vital input. By 2008, fracking had completely reversed the situation, and the cost advantage to U.S. manufacturers has only increased since then.29 The result has been heavy investment in new U.S. petrochemical plants that use natural gas as a feedstock, with 310 new projects under way that will satisfy most U.S. demand and increase U.S. exports from $17 billion in 2016 to $110 billion by 2027.30 This unplanned advantage for America’s chemical subsector will have spillover benefits as the expansion stimulates local development of directly related service and manufacturing businesses.", "In its 2017 report, the International Energy Agency (IEA) noted new renewables installation increased to almost two-thirds of all newly installed electrical energy production.31 By 2021, global generation from renewables should be “equivalent to the total electricity generation of the United States and the European Union put together today.", "”32 In its 2019 Global Energy Perspective, McKinsey & Company predicted that, even as energy consumption doubles by 2050, renewables will generate over 50 percent of the world’s electricity by 2035.33", "In 2006, the IEA predicted that by 2013 global installed photovoltaic capacity would be 20 gigawatts; it was actually 7 times larger—140 gigawatts—and increased to 227 gigawatts by 2015.", "These statistics reflect only utility-scale generating capacity and thus do not account for the growing private installation of renewable energy.", "Both developing and developed countries are seeing huge growth in local production and grids.34 In fact, Bangladesh is the world’s largest market for home-based solar power systems.", "During the first three quarters of 2016, 15 percent of additional residential and nonresidential solar generating capacity was privately installed in the United States.35 Business is also growing in providing renewable energy to major corporations.36 However, two major problems with renewables persist.", "First, they are inherently intermittent. Wind intensity varies in unpredictable ways, and solar fails every night and during bad weather.", "Even hydropower is subject to reduction during periods of drought. Second, the best solar exposure or steadiest winds are often far from the places where people live.", "Thus, renewable energy and power transmission must be thought of as an integrated problem. Around the world, nations and private business are installing renewables along with long-line high-voltage transmission systems.", "Like Europe and China, the United States needs to invest in transmission lines if it is to maximize the use of renewables.", "Fortunately, it has a successful model—Texas. Because its power grid is contained within the state, Texas overcame the various forms of political resistance and built transmission lines from its windy western plains to its energy-hungry eastern cities.", "At times, wind provides 40 percent of the state’s power needs. Other regions have great potential for renewables—for example, the Great Plains and offshore for wind and the Southwest for solar.", "In March 2017, Xcel announced plans to install 800 megawatts of new wind generation capability in the Dakotas and Minnesota.37 Delayed by regulators since 2005, a 3,000-megawatt line is finally being built to take Wyoming’s wind energy to southern California.38 Other investors are seeking to link wind and solar energy to the southeastern and eastern United States.", "Whether users are major power companies looking for a way to store power to feed back into the grid or individual homeowners seeking to get off of it, batteries can offer them an alternative to fossil fuel backups.", "This is another field in which many researchers—commercial, government, and academic—are pursuing a variety of possibilities.", "Major battery technology breakthroughs in 2019 include a battery that can fully charge in 10 minutes, thermal-energy devices that can store 1.2 megawatt-hours and can be hooked in series to create almost unlimited storage, and new processes that could double the storage capacity of lithium-ion batteries.39", "Commercial power companies need massive storage capability to take over the “peaker” function now performed by natural gas–burning plants.", "These plants come online only during periods of peak load to prevent brownouts or even blackouts. Driven partly by California’s Public Utilities Commission, Southern California Edison plans to install a 100-megawatt storage battery by 2020.", "Moving much more quickly, Elon Musk combined Tesla Motors and SolarCity to create a new way of supplying power.", "In July 2017, he signed a contract to provide 100 megawatts of storage in Australia and had the system running and highly profitable by January 2018.40 By October, it was on “track to make back a third of its construction costs in its first year of operation.", "”41 Tesla has contracted to increase the capacity of this system by 50 percent in 2020.42", "The convergence of fracking, renewables, energy grids, and batteries means that more and more energy production will be local or regional.", "Renewables can be moved vast distances via transmission lines, so they can tie a region together. But there will not be a global market for renewables.", "Unlike oil, propane, coal, and LNG, it is impractical and unnecessary to move renewable energy across oceans.", "Thus, unlike the gas/oil market, which contributes to globalization, the renewables market will contribute to regionalization—and even to localization—as more and more businesses and homes take advantage of better battery capacity to move off-grid.", "Just as information technology and the Internet have transformed society, business, government, and warfare since the late 20th century, emerging biotechnology will shape the global landscape for the next several decades.", "The world is entering a new era of biotechnology, highlighted by the advancing ease with which genomes can be engineered for specific purposes.", "Synthetic biology and associated genome-editing tools will be essential for addressing the global challenge of resource scarcity and environmental sustainability, while providing unprecedented advances in public health and medicine.", "The expanding U.S. biotechnology industry, including a wide range of startup companies, along with larger scale corporations, is already exploring capabilities for manufacturing high-value products, creating what is now referred to as the bioeconomy.", "Products of the bioeconomy include the creation of biology-based commodities, fuels, textiles, and consumer goods—all of which are proposed to be produced on innovative biomanufacturing platforms.", "Because the locus of this economic innovation is in industry, and particularly startups, government funding does not primarily drive the bioeconomic trajectory, making government just one of many actors shaping the field.", "In order to establish and maintain global leadership in biotechnology, the United States requires a holistic national approach that supports innovation and growth in the bioeconomy, establishes strategic priorities, and ensures responsible use.", "Emerging biotechnology will have important implications for the Department of Defense (DOD), and internal DOD leadership has acknowledged this by including biotechnology as one of its 11 modernization priorities.43 Moreover, DOD intends to create a community of interest in biotechnology to coordinate biotechnology R&D across the Armed Forces.", "Just some of the many promising advances for defense could include innovative body armor designed from spider silk, jet fuels or runway material produced from algae, living plant-based sensors, and flame-resistant coatings.", "Many other advances, such as those related to skin or gut microbiotics, could benefit the health or performance of warfighters directly; however, DOD is not driving biotechnology innovation, and many challenges exist to the most beneficial incorporation of biotechnology into DOD requirements.", "Outside of traditional force health protections and the development of medical countermeasures, what advantages over adversaries could biotechnology provide?", "What unique DOD challenges and problems are best met with biotechnological solutions versus other emerging technologies?", "These questions have yet to be addressed as industry continues to innovate.", "At the same time, new dual-use technologies for defense will present significant challenges to biodefense, in addition to the ethical and moral dilemmas they have already created; the capabilities that drive the U.S. bioeconomy are the same tools that could allow for the creation of bioweapons (see also chapter 8).", "Most recently, the National Academy of Sciences published a biodefense consensus report, providing a framework for assessing those capabilities that are the most concerning to the DOD warfighter—namely, the creation of viruses from scratch, the modification of harmful bacteriological pathogens, and the development of harmful chemicals through biomanufacture.44 DOD will need to address these issues in ways that do not stifle the technology’s advancement or America’s competitiveness in the global bioeconomy.", "As noted in the introduction, two factors should enable U.S. technological advances. The first, investment, is on a positive trend; the second, immigration policy, is having a powerful negative effect.", "Obviously, in a period of swift technological change, robust investment in R&D is essential to leveraging those shifts.", "Fortunately, despite all the hype about the Made in China 2025 plan to dominate 10 key emerging technologies, the United States still invests significantly more in R&D than does China.", "Unfortunately, from 2003 to 2016, U.S. Government spending in nondefense R&D was essentially flat. Since then, government investment has increased sharply.45 In 2018, the United States invested 2.84 percent of its gross domestic product (GDP) in R&D. China invested only 1.97 percent of a significantly smaller GDP.46", "The key question is whether the United States will sustain this investment in the face of rapidly increasing debt-servicing costs and continued deficit spending.", "The bad news is that current U.S. immigration policy is having a major negative impact on America’s progress toward a fourth industrial revolution economy.", "While immigration policy is a hot political issue, one element that is not usually associated with immigration is the intellectual nature of the fourth industrial revolution.", "Exploiting the revolution requires large numbers of smart, skilled, and educated people. Innovation at the top of the scale requires advanced education in science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) skills.", "The 330 million people of the United States cannot hope to stay ahead of the 7 billion people in the rest of the world.", "In the past, the United States has had great success by encouraging the best STEM students from around the world to come to America for an education and then stay to work.", "In 2017, foreign nationals in the United States accounted for 81 percent of the full-time graduate students in electrical engineering and petroleum engineering; 79 percent in computer science; 75 percent in industrial engineering; 69 percent in statistics; 63 percent in mechanical engineering, and economics; 59 percent in civil engineering; and 57 percent in chemical engineering.47", "The United States is generally recognized as having the finest university system in the world, and it attracts large numbers of the best foreign students.", "This is a major advantage, but what really counted was the fact that the number of foreign STEM graduates who chose to remain in the United States to work increased by 400 percent from 2008 to 2016.", "Essentially, the United States was attracting and keeping some of the finest minds in the world.", "The policy of encouraging immigrants to stay paid off. Despite representing only 13 percent of the U.S. population, immigrants start more than 25 percent of the new businesses in the United States.", "More than 20 percent of the chief executive officers of the 2014 Inc. top 500 business are immigrants.48 And 55 percent of the new companies worth more than $1 billion have at least 1 immigrant as a founding member.49", "Then, in 2017, two things happened that dramatically reversed the flow of foreign students into U.S. universities.", "First, the U.S. Government made it much harder for students to obtain visas or to be certain they could renew them year to year.", "At the same time, the Trump administration restricted the number of graduates who can remain in the country to work.", "The result has been a major downturn in the number of foreign students enrolled in U.S. universities.", "Other countries, having seen the success that the United States was having, have started their own aggressive recruiting programs to attract foreign students—and current U.S. policy is only assisting those foreign programs in attracting top students.", "It makes no sense for a foreign student to invest heavily in a U.S. education when the visa might not be renewed and thus the investment will not pay off in a degree; even if he or she succeeds in getting a degree, the U.S. job market, which needs STEM graduates, will be closed.", "It makes much more sense for these students to go to school in Canada, Australia, or the United Kingdom.", "Canada and Australia, in particular, are encouraging overseas students.", "Not only do current U.S. policies deprive the United States of intelligent, productive students and potential citizens, they also hurt America universities.", "Overseas students pay much higher tuitions than do U.S. citizens and so, in effect, subsidize their education.", "Universities across the country are having to cut STEM programs due to the reduction in funds flowing in from overseas.50 In short, U.S. immigration policies in 2020 are directly responsible for reducing the flow of the people America needs to thrive in the fourth industrial revolution.", "By failing to effectively distinguish between types of potential immigrants, the United States is excluding a great deal of talent.", "In sharp contrast, forward-thinking governments elsewhere are enticing the best and brightest from around the world to move to their nations.", "Current immigration policies are damaging American prospects for success in a rapidly changing global economy.", "The convergence of the aforementioned technologies will change societies in ways that are hard to imagine.", "It is already clear these technologies will change what, how, and where we manufacture commodities. Most important, manufacturing will be located near the market, which means the trend of onshoring manufacturing to America will continue.", "New technologies are also returning service-industry jobs to the markets they aid, and renewable energy is inherently regional rather than global.", "Environmental movements will reinforce these trends by pushing to reduce the impact of manufacturing and agriculture on the environment.", "The fourth industrial revolution is shifting trade networks from the global to regional and even local levels.", "The United States may well be the nation best positioned to benefit from this shift. The U.S. economy already derives 84 percent of its GDP from the United States, Canada, and Mexico.", "Although the supply chains are deeply embedded in Asia, U.S. manufacturing and services have been in the process of moving production back to the United States for years.", "The United States benefits from effective rule of law, strong protection of intellectual property, the largest market in the world, an exceptional university system, heavy investment in R&D, and a pervasive entrepreneurial spirit.", "These attributes will allow the country to thrive in this era of rapid technological change.", "Until 2017, foreign investors thought so too. Foreign direct investment (FDI), particularly in manufacturing, was running at record levels in 2015 and 2016.", "Unfortunately, the uncertainty introduced by tariffs has reduced FDI into the United States by over 50 percent.", "However, the long-term advantages are still present, and FDI flows should recover once the United States establishes and sticks to stable trade agreements.", "America must also ensure its immigration and R&D policies do not hold it back. Economically, the United States has distinct advantages over both China and Russia as the fourth industrial revolution begins to reshape our world.", "The one key weakness is the gridlock in America’s current political systems. Failure to adjust our laws and regulations to the new reality risks squandering those advantages.", "China could also benefit greatly from the fourth industrial revolution. The Chinese Communist Party specifically developed its Made in China 2025 plan to take advantage of the new technologies.", "The party selected 10 priority sectors to subsidize, which included robotics, green energy, artificial intelligence, biosciences, and materials.", "Essentially, China is investing heavily in each of the technologies discussed in this chapter; it is also working hard to shift its economy from export based to consumption based, to decrease its reliance on exports.", "It needs to do so because it is already suffering from businesses leaving to protect intellectual property rights and increasing labor costs.", "However, even as these efforts progress, China will have to deal with the dramatic reduction in labor required in its industries and its rapidly aging, and hence less productive, population.", "It must do so even as its economy slows significantly and pushback to its Belt and Road Initiative grows.", "While the Chinese government has once again turned to stimulus spending, a key question is whether the cumulative public and private debt is manageable.", "On the positive side, China’s working population has been declining for the past couple of years and will continue to do so.", "Thus, it will need fewer jobs. At the same time, China has an enormous talent pool due to the sheer size of its population.", "Furthermore, Chinese universities have steadily improved in global rankings. Most important for China’s future is the fact that Asian trade is also regionalizing and China is central to the fastest growing region in the world.", "If the Chinese Communist Party’s use of centralized management can mitigate these challenges, China too can be a big winner in the fourth industrial revolution.", "In contrast, Russia is not well positioned to benefit. Transitioning to advanced manufacturing requires major investment, and Russia currently suffers from a lack of investor confidence.", "The Institute of International Finance ranked Russia “last among 23 emerging economies in terms of ‘real’ FDI.”51 Russian businesses have not been particularly innovative, nor has the country created an environment that encourages foreign innovators to establish businesses there.", "Compounding its problems, Russia’s economy remains dependent on exporting energy, which generated 60 percent of its GDP.52 Today, technological improvements in various fields as well as global warming concerns are driving a worldwide shift to alternative energy.", "Russia also faces major human capital issues due to its demography and low-quality university system.", "No Russian institution rated in the top 250 of U.S. News & World Report’s university rankings, and only 2 made it into the top 400.53 Finally, as a kleptocracy, Russia does a poor job of allocating capital to the industries that benefit most from the convergence of these new technologies.", "1 Klaus Schwab, The Fourth Industrial Revolution (Cologny, Switzerland: World Economic Forum, 2016), 6–7.", "3 “Global Industrial Robot Sales Reach Record Level in 2018,” Xinhua, September 19, 2019, available at <www.china.org.cn/business/2019-09/19/content_75222098.htm>.", "4 Allan Collard-Wexler and Jan De Loecker, “Reallocation and Technology: Evidence from the U.S. Steel Industry,” American Economic Review 105, no. 1 (January 2015), 131–171.", "5 Mihai Andrei, “Chinese Factory Replaces 90% of Human Workers with Robots: Production Rises by 250%, Defects Drop by 80%,” ZME Science, February 3, 2017, available at <www.zmescience.com/other/economics/china-factory-robots-03022017>.", "6 “Industrial Robots in United States to Cut Labor Costs,” Technavio (blog), June 1, 2016, available at <https://blog.technavio.com/blog/industrial-robots-united-states-cut-labor-costs-21-2020>.", "7 Erin Duffin, “Manufacturing Labor Costs per Hour for China, Vietnam, Mexico from 2016 to 2020 (in U.S. Dollars),” Statista, August 9, 2019, available at <www.statista.com/statistics/744071/manufacturing-labor-costs-per-hour-china-vietnam-mexico/>.", "8 Frank Tobe, “Why Co-Bots Will be a Huge Innovation and Growth Driver for Robotics Industry,” IEEE Spectrum, December 30, 2016, available at <http://spectrum.ieee.org/automaton/robotics/industrial-robots/collaborative-robots-innovation-growth-driver>.", "9 Bruce Geiselman, “Upgrades to Collaborative Robots Bring Cost Savings,” Plastics Machinery, May 31, 2017, available at <www.plasticsmachinerymagazine.com/blow-molding/article/13002309>.", "10 Ben Halder, “How China’s ‘Cobot’ Revolution Could Transform Automation,” OZY, March 24, 2019, available at <www.ozy.com/fast-forward/how-chinas-cobot-revolution-could-transform-automation/93044>.", "11 “Lightweight Cobots Take on Heavy-Duty Jobs—Even Welding,” Universal Robots, November 9, 2017, available at <https://blog.universal-robots.com/lightweight-cobots-take-on-heavy-duty-jobs-even-welding>.", "12 “Goldman Sachs Summary on Cobots,” Robotenomics, July 26, 2016, available at <https://robotonomics.wordpress.com/tag/cobots/>.", "13 Halder, “How China’s ‘Cobot’ Revolution Could Transform Automation.”", "14 David Gershgorn, “Japanese White-Collar Workers Are Already Being Replaced by Artificial Intelligence,” Quartz, January 2, 2017, available at <http://qz.com/875491/japanese-white-collar-workers-are-already-being-replaced-by-artificial-intelligence>.", "15 Carlos E.
