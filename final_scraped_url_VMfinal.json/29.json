The date was April 8, 1980, when our founders established Applied Molecular Genetics (later shortened to Amgen) in Thousand Oaks, California, to explore new business opportunities made possible by the biotechnology revolution getting underway at that time.", "Since then, we’ve seen hundreds of biotech companies come and go as Amgen flourished. While Thousand Oaks still serves as our global headquarters—and our original building still stands—Amgen ranks today among the largest companies on the Fortune 500, with more than 23,000 employees in 100 countries around the world.", "We are proud of what we have accomplished—and eager to do more. We know that an aging global population will require innovative new treatments for illnesses like cancer and heart disease that claim millions of lives and cost society hundreds of billions of dollars each year.", "The pioneering spirit of Amgen—a hallmark for four decades—gives us confidence that we can play an increasingly important role in the global healthcare ecosystem.", "By doing so, we are also confident that we can continue to deliver on the commitments that we make to you, our shareholders.", "As anticipated, total revenues decreased slightly in 2019 as double-digit, volume-driven growth of many of our newer medicines did not fully offset the decline in sales of our off-patent legacy products, which faced increased competition around the world.", "Total revenues of $23.4 billion were down 2% from the prior year, with non-GAAP earnings per share rising 3% to a record $14.82.1 For the full year, Amgen achieved a non-GAAP operating margin of 50.2%,1 among the highest in our industry, which reflected our ability to manage our efficiency and ongoing productivity gains.", "We invested more than $4.0 billion1 in research and development, up 10% from the prior year, as we advanced numerous potential new medicines across all stages of our pipeline.", "We also delivered an attractive return to our shareholders in 2019. Specifically, Amgen delivered a total shareholder return of 28% last year, exceeding the 19% average return of our peer group.", "Our five-year total shareholder return of 73% also outpaced the average return of our peer group, which delivered a 46% return over the same time period.", "Looking at an even longer investment horizon, a purchase of $10,000 of Amgen stock the day the company went public in 1983 would have been worth more than $8.6 million as of December 31, 2019, including the reinvestment of dividends.", "Additionally, in 2019, we returned more than $11 billion to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases.", "As a leading global healthcare company and responsible corporate citizen, Amgen is committed to help address the COVID-19 outbreak.", "We have prioritized the safety of our employees, the continued supply of our medicines to patients, and the health of the communities where we live and work.", "For current information on our response to this unprecedented situation, please visit www.amgen.com/COVID-19.", "2019 was a challenging year and one for which we were prepared. Managing the impact of patent expirations on highly successful products is one of the fundamental challenges that all large companies in our industry eventually face.", "I was pleased to report on an earnings call in January 2020 that we expect to return to top-line growth this year.", "There are a few factors driving our expected resurgence, including our recently launched products, our ongoing global expansion, our robust pipeline of potential new medicines, and our acquisition of Otezla®.", "We have launched a number of new medicines in recent years that treat some of the world’s most serious, prevalent, and costly diseases.", "We have been able to generate growth from these new products largely through volume gains, rather than price increases.", "This is critical in an environment in which healthcare systems around the world are wrestling with how to pay for the quality care that aging populations desire.", "In 2019, for example, we launched EVENITY®, the first and only osteoporosis treatment that both increases bone formation and reduces bone loss, thereby rapidly reducing the risk of fracture.", "Osteoporosis is a major public health crisis affecting millions of people worldwide, especially women.", "The statistics are staggering. According to the World Health Organization, one in three women worldwide over the age of 50 will suffer a fracture due to osteoporosis.", "Each year in the U.S. alone, osteoporosis-related fractures account for 432,000 hospital admissions and 180,000 nursing home admissions—and after the first fracture, a woman is five times more likely to suffer another fracture within a year.", "Amgen has been engaged in the fight against osteoporosis for many years with Prolia®, our innovative, market-leading anti-resorptive therapy.", "EVENITY® gives us another weapon in this fight, and we are encouraged by its early performance and long-term potential.", "We further strengthened our product portfolio in 2019 through the $13.4 billion acquisition of Otezla®, the only oral, non-biologic treatment for psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis.", "Otezla® bolsters our existing inflammation franchise, which includes Enbrel®, our largest product. Otezla® sales in 2019 totaled nearly $2 billion, with Amgen booking $178 million of these sales following the close of the acquisition in late November.", "We acquired the global rights to Otezla®, which is approved in more than 50 countries, including Amgen’s 10 largest markets.", "Through the acquisition, we also welcomed more than 800 new employees to Amgen and haven’t missed a beat for the more than 400,000 patients worldwide who have been treated with Otezla®.", "We expect this product to be a key growth driver for us in 2020 and beyond.", "EVENITY® and Otezla® join a portfolio that includes six medicines that in 2019 each generated annual sales in excess of $500 million and grew at high-single-digit or double-digit rates.", "Repatha®, for example, is Amgen’s medicine for people with high LDL cholesterol who are at risk for heart attacks and strokes—devastating health events that occur every 40 seconds in the U.S.", "In 2018, to address access challenges, we made Repatha® available in the U.S. at 60% less than its original list price.", "This decision led to 20% sales growth in 2019 as more patients, especially senior citizens in the Medicare program, were able to access this important medicine at a more affordable co-pay.", "In addition to new innovative medicines, we are strengthening our product portfolio by leveraging our decades of biomanufacturing experience to bring to patients a reliable supply of high-quality biosimilars, which are typically priced below the originator medicines with which they compete.", "In 2019, AMGEVITA™, our biosimilar to the autoimmune disease treatment Humira®, the world’s best-selling medicine, generated more than $200 million in global sales.", "We also launched our first two biosimilars in the U.S., MVASI™ and KANJINTI™, which are biosimilars to the cancer treatments Avastin® and Herceptin®, respectively.", "In total, Amgen biosimilars generated $568 million in 2019 sales and we believe these medicines represent a significant growth opportunity for us over time.", "Biosimilars also benefit our business because they free up funds in healthcare budgets that can be redirected toward our innovative medicines.", "As the number of biosimilars in our portfolio grows, we are increasingly able to have more holistic conversations with healthcare systems about how best to care for the patients they serve—and how to pay for that care.", "For example, AMGEVITA™ is highly complementary to Otezla®, as both medicines treat patients with chronic inflammatory diseases.", "Similarly, MVASI™ and KANJINTI™ complement the many innovative cancer medicines in our portfolio. In 2020, we plan to launch AVSOLA™, our biosimilar to the inflammation treatment Remicade®, in the U.S., and we continue to advance several additional biosimilars through our pipeline, including ABP 938, our biosimilar to EYLEA® for age-related macular degeneration.", "For much of our 40-year history, Amgen offered its medicines to patients primarily in one market: the U.S.", "Although the U.S. remains the world’s largest pharmaceutical market—and therefore continues to be a top priority for Amgen—the rest of the world offers increasingly compelling opportunities to serve more patients and drive growth.", "We are especially excited by our prospects in China and Japan, the world’s second- and third-largest pharmaceutical markets, respectively.", "In 2019, we announced a strategic collaboration with BeiGene—a biotechnology company with a large presence and deep experience in China—to expand Amgen’s oncology business there and advance the development of our innovative oncology pipeline globally.", "In January 2020, as part of the collaboration, Amgen acquired a 20.5% ownership stake in BeiGene for approximately $2.8 billion, while BeiGene will contribute up to $1.25 billion to advance 20 medicines from Amgen’s innovative oncology pipeline.", "We will use data generated from clinical trials in China to support regulatory filings in that country and around the world.", "Additionally, BeiGene will commercialize select current and future Amgen oncology medicines in China for up to seven years, after which most of these medicines will return to Amgen.", "We are committed to serving cancer patients in China, and we expect BeiGene will enable us to have an impact sooner than we could have achieved on our own.", "Cancer currently claims an estimated 2.3 million lives in China every year and it will only become an even more pressing public health concern as the population ages.", "Beyond cancer, Amgen will continue to develop and commercialize medicines in China for chronic conditions such as cardiovascular disease.", "We have built our business in Japan largely through partnerships with local companies, including, most recently, Astellas Pharma.", "In April 2020, we will assume full ownership of the Amgen Astellas BioPharma joint venture, enabling us to do business in Japan through a wholly owned Amgen subsidiary.", "Japan is a “super-aged” society, with 27% of its population 65 or older—the highest percentage in the world—and it will require ever more innovative medicines to treat diseases associated with the aging process.", "We’ve enjoyed great success in Japan with EVENITY®, for example, the osteoporosis treatment described above.", "In fact, Japan was the first market in the world where EVENITY® was launched.", "We are confident that our current and emerging portfolio of medicines matches up well with the needs of patients in the Asia-Pacific region—so much so that we expect roughly 25% of our total sales growth to come from this region over the next 10 years.", "Over the past five years, we have invested nearly $19 billion1 in research and development. As of this writing, more than 31,000 patients are enrolled in some 150 clinical trials around the world involving dozens of potential new Amgen medicines.", "In 2019 alone, we advanced seven potential new therapies into Phase 1 clinical studies, and we submitted Investigational New Drug applications to bring four additional molecules into the clinic.", "In keeping with our enduring commitment to cutting-edge research—two-thirds of the innovative medicines we currently market are first-in-class therapies—a large majority of our pipeline programs aim to take medicine in new directions and provide substantial new benefits to patients.", "For example, AMG 510 is a potential first-in-class medicine for non-small cell lung cancer and other solid tumors that have a particular genetic mutation known as KRAS G12C.", "This mutation is found in approximately 13% of non-small cell lung cancers, 3%–5% of colorectal cancers, and 1%–2% of other solid tumors.", "Cancer researchers have known about KRAS G12C for more than 30 years, but it’s long been considered an “undruggable” target.", "Amgen scientists were the first to exploit a previously hidden crevice on the surface of the KRASG12C protein to engineer a molecule that has demonstrated encouraging results for patients who otherwise currently have very few treatment options.", "We are studying AMG 510 as a monotherapy and in combination with other cancer therapies, and we expect data from some of these studies to become available later this year.", "Amgen is also a pioneer in the development of bispecific T cell engagers, or BiTE® antibody constructs, which are designed to harness a patient’s own immune system to fight cancer.", "Our pipeline now includes about a dozen BiTE® molecules directed against both liquid and solid tumors, including multiple myeloma, acute myeloid leukemia, and prostate cancer.", "We expect to report important data on several of our BiTE® molecules in 2020.", "One in five cancer patients in the U.S. is already being treated with an Amgen medicine, and we are excited to continue building on our strong legacy in oncology.", "We also recognize that oncology is a very crowded and competitive therapeutic category—good news for patients but challenging for companies that are often pursuing the same promising targets.", "In response, we have worked hard in recent years to dramatically improve the speed with which we move new drug candidates forward.", "On average, we have taken three years out of a drug discovery and development cycle that historically has taken anywhere from 10 to 15 years.", "In some cases, as with AMG 510, we have been moving even faster. We also have become more agile in terms of how we allocate our resources.", "As new data emerges about our oncology molecules and those being developed by others, we will be clear-eyed in our analysis and quickly adjust our investment levels up or down, as appropriate.", "We also have a number of promising new drug candidates outside of oncology. One of these is tezepelumab, a first-in-class investigational monoclonal antibody for severe asthma, a debilitating disease that affects an estimated 30 million people worldwide—a number that is expected to rise dramatically as more people move to large cities where air pollution is often an unfortunate fact of life.", "Along with our partner AstraZeneca, we expect to see data from a pivotal Phase 3 clinical trial of tezepelumab by the end of this year.", "We also anticipate pivotal Phase 3 data later this year for omecamtiv mecarbil, which we are studying as a treatment for heart failure with reduced ejection fraction in collaboration with our partners Cytokinetics and Servier.", "An estimated 64 million people worldwide are living with heart failure, and roughly half of these patients will die within five years of being diagnosed—meaning there is an urgent need for new treatments.", "To learn more about the many potential new medicines in our pipeline, please visit www.amgenpipeline.com.", "When it comes to research and development, many of our peers have opted to focus largely on development, leaving early-stage research to smaller companies and acquiring drugs only after they have progressed into the later stages of the research and development process.", "Amgen is taking a very different approach. Just as the creation of recombinant DNA sparked the biotechnology revolution in the 1980s, a new revolution fueled by human genetics and related data is enhancing our understanding of human biology and, with it, our ability to predict and prevent diseases to a previously unimaginable degree.", "It is critical to Amgen’s long-term success that we be a part of this revolution and we believe we are in a position to lead it.", "Since our acquisition of Reykjavik-based deCODE Genetics in 2012, we have invested aggressively to strengthen its research infrastructure and expand its data pipeline well beyond Iceland.", "When it comes to human genetics, the more data, the better—and since becoming an Amgen subsidiary, deCODE has increased the number of participants in its research tenfold.", "This expansion will continue to accelerate with two major research initiatives launched in 2019. In June, deCODE entered into a collaboration with Intermountain Healthcare, an integrated healthcare delivery network, to analyze the genomes of up to 500,000 Intermountain patients, located primarily in Utah and Idaho.", "In September, Amgen and deCODE joined the UK Biobank’s Whole Genome Sequencing project—the most ambitious effort of its kind yet undertaken.", "deCODE was selected as one of two providers, along with the Sanger Institute, to sequence the whole genomes of all 500,000 participants in this program.", "To complement our strength in human genetics, we have broadened our focus to include other types of human data that can generate deeper insights into disease biology.", "For example, advances in proteomics now allow us to measure the levels of proteins that are potentially meaningful but present at previously undetectable concentrations in the blood.", "In collaboration with SomaLogic, a leader in proteomics technology, deCODE has measured the relative levels of about 5,000 different proteins in plasma collected from 37,000 Icelanders whose genomes have been sequenced.", "To our knowledge, this is the largest proteomics experiment ever conducted. By combining data on proteins, RNA, and genetics, we are beginning to generate insights that will have a profound impact on drug discovery and clinical trials.", "We are already using this multilayered information to design more efficient clinical trials by identifying patients who are at higher risk for poor outcomes and more likely to benefit from the therapies we are testing.", "In 2019, we also acquired Nuevolution—now Amgen Research Copenhagen—a pioneer and leader in the field of DNA-encoded libraries.", "In a DNA-encoded library, each compound is tagged with a unique sequence of DNA that functions like a barcode, and mixtures containing billions of unique DNA-tagged compounds can be screened in a single small test tube.", "The massive increase in screening power makes it practical to search for extremely rare compounds that can engage targets now considered undruggable.", "This technology will also advance Amgen’s effort to pioneer new types of drug molecules that work through a principle known as induced proximity.", "While nearly all medicines today achieve their effects by directly engaging a single target, induced proximity agents have multi-specific activity that enable them to function like “molecular matchmakers.”", "Instead of trying to tackle difficult drug targets on their own, these molecules can enlist powerful biological mechanisms to get the job done.", "While this new paradigm is just getting started, we believe it has astonishing potential to treat diseases that currently have few, if any, good treatment options.", "Over the course of our 40-year history, Amgen has made a difference in the health of patients around the world by discovering, developing, and bringing to market innovative medicines—and this will continue to be the best way we can contribute to the greater good.", "We survey thousands of our employees each quarter. Consistently, they are passionate about our mission and values, committed to ethical behavior, and understand how their work individually contributes to Amgen’s collective success.", "Our people also believe strongly that they work in an environment in which diverse backgrounds and perspectives are welcomed and valued.", "We have nine employee resource groups at Amgen encompassing thousands of employees worldwide who are dedicated to supporting each other, our business, and the community.", "These groups represent African Americans, women, veterans, the LGBTQ community, those with disabilities, and early career professionals, among others—and each group is sponsored by one of my direct reports.", "To give you just one example of the impact our employee resource groups are having, the Amgen Black Employees Network collaborated with our Oncology team in 2019 to create an award-winning educational website about multiple myeloma focused on African Americans, who have more than double the risk of developing this disease than the general population.", "Increasingly, our employees want to work for a company with a purpose that goes beyond “the numbers.”", "We are fortunate at Amgen to have a core business that is centered on improving human health—a noble purpose to be sure, but we can do more.", "We know, for example, that too many patients who need medicines struggle to access them. We are committed to responsible pricing practices and, in fact, the net selling price of our medicines declined in 2018 and 2019 globally, as we expect it will again this year.", "Additionally, in 2019, the Amgen Safety Net Foundation provided nearly $1.5 billion of our medicines to uninsured or underinsured patients in the U.S. at no cost—and nearly $7 billion of our medicines since 2008.", "We also are working closely with elected officials, insurers, patient groups, and others to advocate for changes in the U.S. healthcare system that will make prescription medicines more accessible and affordable.", "Outside the U.S., we recently completed our second donation of biologic medicines to low- and middle-income countries around the world through the humanitarian aid organization Direct Relief.", "We operate our business in a way that seeks to minimize our impact on the environment. In 2019, Amgen achieved—one year ahead of schedule—targets we set seven years earlier to reduce our carbon emissions and water use, even as our business has significantly expanded during this time period.", "Later this year, we will establish a new set of environmental targets, which you will be able to see at www.amgen.com/responsibility.", "We continue to work on the construction of our second next-generation biomanufacturing facility, located in Rhode Island.", "This new plant builds on the success of our first such facility in Singapore, which delivers the same output as a traditional manufacturing facility but in a much smaller physical space.", "Compared with a traditional plant, our Singapore facility each year uses approximately 268,000 less gigajoules of energy and 82,000 fewer cubic meters of water, while also reducing carbon emissions by 8,800 metric tons.", "Just as we are working to ensure the sustainability of the planet, we are also passionate about ensuring the sustainability of scientific progress.", "Amgen is in a long-cycle business. A new treatment discovered in our laboratories today might be launched a dozen years from now by future Amgen employees who are still in high school.", "Toward that end, the Amgen Foundation is focused on inspiring the next generation of innovators by bringing top-notch science education to millions of young people around the world—seven million and counting, in fact.", "For example, the Amgen Foundation is the exclusive sponsor of the biology lessons offered by Khan Academy, which provides free, world-class educational content online.", "Since our partnership began in 2015, the number of people accessing Khan Academy’s biology lessons has increased eightfold to well over 3 million per month.", "Earlier this year, the Amgen Foundation announced a partnership with the Harvard Faculty of Arts and Sciences to launch LabXchange, a virtual learning laboratory that, like the lessons offered by Khan Academy, is available at no cost to anyone worldwide.", "LabXchange provides the opportunity to practice scientific experiments using interactive simulations of the same cutting-edge equipment found in modern biotech laboratories—from pipettes and high-powered microscopes to centrifuges and spectrophotometers.", "We believe LabXchange will be especially valuable to those students in schools or countries where teachers lack the resources to provide engaging, hands-on scientific experiences.", "The Amgen Foundation also continues to expand its in-classroom programs, including the Amgen Biotech Experience, a two-week, lab-based program that enables high school students to build a better understanding of science and how it applies to making medicines.", "This program began 30 years ago when a few Amgen scientists in Thousand Oaks, California, partnered with a local biology teacher to engage students at nearby high schools.", "Since then, more than 800,000 students in 11 countries around the world have participated in the program—and we are delighted that some of them now work at Amgen.", "As I reflect on the past 40 years at Amgen and consider the next 40, I am struck both by the incredible medical progress that’s been made over time and by how much hard work is still left to be done.", "At our founding in 1980, the death rate for cancer in the U.S. was on the rise and wouldn’t reach its peak until 1991.", "Since then, according to the American Cancer Society, the cancer death rate has been steadily declining, falling 27% in aggregate over the past 25 years.", "Fully half of this remarkable decline is attributed to the growing number of innovative cancer medicines that have become available to patients.", "Can all of us at Amgen be proud of the contributions we’ve made to dramatically improving cancer care?", "Absolutely. Is it time to declare mission accomplished? Absolutely not. Not when cancer will claim over 600,000 lives in the U.S. this year—and nearly 9 million more lives around the world.", "Not when the five-year survival rate for many common cancers remains below 50%. Not when new cancer medicines are seen as significant advances when they extend life for a few months, rather than for several years.", "Not when cancer costs the world more than $1 trillion every year.", "We enter our fifth decade at Amgen more confident than ever in our ability to make a difference against cancer and many other of the world’s most serious illnesses.", "By doing so, we will not only change the lives of tens of millions of patients but also create more opportunities for our employees, strengthen the communities where we live and work, and create long-term shareholder value.", "On behalf of Amgen’s board of directors, our senior leadership team, and our employees around the world, I thank you for your continued support of our company and the important work we do.", "- This is a non-GAAP financial measure.

In particular, concerns regarding pure red cell aplasia (PRCA) and increased cardiovascular-related adverse events have been of great interest to the nephrology community and are relevant to the development of new ESAs.", "The sudden appearance outside the US of patients presenting with antibody-mediated PRCA in the late 1990s, primarily associated with subcutaneous administration of Eprex, highlighted the potential consequence of manufacturing changes on product safety.[14]", "Furthermore, several cardiovascular (CV) outcome-related studies pointed to an increase in CV adverse events associated with higher hemoglobin targets and the increasing doses of ESAs required to achieve those targets.[15,16]", "As a consequence, the FDA (as well as other regulatory bodies around the world) stipulated a warning in 2007 for all ESAs prompting clinicians to use the lowest dose of drug in patients to maintain adequate hemoglobin levels.[17]", "A small number of case reports of an antibody-mediated form of PRCA associated with ESA therapy began to appear in the literature around the mid-1990s, but the complication did not receive much attention until an “epidemic” of ESA-associated PRCA occurred between 1998 and 2004.[18]", "In 1998, Johnson & Johnson, the manufacturer of Eprex, changed the stabilizing agent of the product from human serum albumin to polysorbate 80 and glycine, prompted by European concern about the potential for transmission of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease.[14] After much study, it was hypothesized that the polysorbate 80 may have increased the immunogenicity of Eprex by eliciting formation of epoetin-containing micelles or by interacting with leachates released by the uncoated rubber stoppers of prefilled syringes for subcutaneous administration.[19]", "Compared with the previous formulation, the polysorbate 80 formulation had a lower stability, making it more susceptible to stress conditions (e.g., insufficient attention to the cold chain).", "This situation may have facilitated protein denaturation or aggregate formation.[20]", "From 1999 to 2002, global reports of antibody-mediated PRCA increased with more than 60 cases of PRCA reported with Eprex per year.[18]", "In December 2002, health authorities in Europe formally contraindicated subcutaneous administration of Eprex for patients with chronic kidney disease.[19,21]", "The incidence of PRCA returned to historical low rates by 2003 after Johnson & Johnson replaced the uncoated rubber stoppers with Teflon stoppers in the prefilled syringes, supported intravenous administration of the product, and improved cold chain storage management.[14,20] The contraindication for subcutaneous administration of Eprex was later removed in 2006 after completion of the PRIMS study, which showed that rates of PRCA had returned to the expected background incidence.[19]", "As treatment with ESAs were rarely ‘switched’ during this time period, it is likely that identification of the source of immunogenicity in patients receiving Eprex was the result of a common treatment pattern by nephrologists.", "Although the dramatic spike in PRCA cases has decreased since the early 2000s, a small number of cases have continued to be reported worldwide—almost all associated with subcutaneous administration.", "Although intravenous administration of a protein is less likely to evoke an immune response than the subcutaneous route, PRCA with intravenous administration of epoetin has been reported in the literature, including a case in Japan where a patient received both epoetin alfa and darbepoetin alfa.[22] Two additional cases of PRCA with intravenous epoetin have been described, but follow-up did not preclude the subcutaneous route of administration.[23]", "Furthermore, several cases of PRCA have also been reported following the use of epoetin ‘copy’ biologics in regions where there are less rigorous regulations regarding product storage and manufacturing.[20]", "The use of blood transfusions and androgenic steroids for the treatment of anemia in patients with CKD was supplanted by ESAs, likely the result of improved quality of life in early studies involving erythropoietin and CKD.", "As the link between cardiovascular disease and CKD became more evident, it became clear that anemia was an independent risk factor for developing left ventricular hypertrophy and heart failure.", "However, in the absence of well-controlled studies, ESAs became the mainstay to treat anemia while the optimal level of hemoglobin to limit cardiovascular events remained unknown.", "Between 1991 and 2005, the mean ESA dose increased about four-fold in dialysis patients in the US.[24]", "Following reports of increased adverse events from outcomes studies, such as cardiovascular events and more frequent hypertensive episodes when using higher doses of ESAs to achieve higher hemoglobin targets, the FDA mandated a black box warning for all ESAs in 2007.[17]", "The decision was based on key data obtained from the Normal Hematocrit Cardiac Trial (NHCT),[25] the Correction of Hemoglobin and Outcomes in Renal Insufficiency (CHOIR) study, [15] and the Cardiovascular Risk Reduction by Early Anemia Treatment with Epoetin Beta (CREATE) study.[16]", "Briefly, the results of NHCT pointed to an increase in vascular access thrombosis and a trend towards death and heart attacks among dialysis patients in the higher hematocrit arm, while the CHOIR study confirmed an increased risk of a composite endpoint including death and cardiovascular events among predialysis patients targeted to higher hematocrit levels.", "The CREATE study did not demonstrate differences between patients assigned to either full or partial correction of anemia in terms of cardiovascular events, but a prespecified secondary analysis showed a higher risk of end-stage renal disease requiring dialysis among the patients with the higher target for hemoglobin concentration.", "More recent studies, including the Trial to Reduce Cardiovascular Events with Aranesp Therapy (TREAT) and the subanalysis of the Reduction of Events by Darbepoetin Alfa in Heart Failure (RED-HF) study, reinforce the aforementioned data and demonstrate the correction of anemia in CKD patients with ESAs does not confer a beneficial effect on mortality, or cardiovascular or renal outcomes.[26,27]", "As noted, biologics are genetically-engineered proteins derived from human, animal, or microorganism sources.", "They are a major area of growth in the medical community, accounting for one-third of new medicine approvals in the past decade.[28]", "As of 2013, the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America reported more than 900 biologics in development.[28] Biologics play an integral and often transformative role in many therapeutic settings, and guidelines from medical societies and payer groups have incorporated biologics into recommended treatment regimens, either as primary or supportive care.[4]", "Despite the immense therapeutic benefit conferred to patients, the growing use of biologics comes at a significant cost, representing one of the fastest growing segments of stretched healthcare budgets around the world.[29] Unlike small-molecule drugs, synthesized by chemically reproducible processes, biologics are genetically-engineered proteins that are produced by living systems and have inherent variability.", "Due to the large and structurally complex molecules that comprise biologics, as well as differences in cell lines and processes used during manufacturing, “identical” copies of biologics cannot be developed.", "Thus, a similar copy of a biologic drug, a “biosimilar”, is not to be regarded as a generic version of a currently approved biologic.", "Rather, a biosimilar is a biologic drug that is highly similar to an approved reference biologic drug.", "The high level of similarity to the reference product includes the same primary structure, mechanism of action, and drug target, among other physiochemical similarities, based on the results of an extensive comparability exercise which includes clinical confirmation of pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics outlined by regulatory authorities.[30,31] A product that does not meet these standards cannot be approved as a biosimilar.", "For biosimilars to achieve full acceptance in global markets, it is crucial that they be considered analytically, pharmacokinetically, and therapeutically equivalent with their reference product.", "Thus, biosimilars must go through a rigorous development process and comparability exercise, and demonstrate no clinically significant differences in safety, purity, and potency compared to the reference product.", "Given the inherent variability of a biologic compared with a small-drug molecules and acknowledging a biosimilar cannot be “identical” to a reference biologic product (which itself is structurally variable from batch to batch), regulatory authorities recognized the need for a unique approval pathway for biosimilars distinct from generics.", "The European Union (EU) was the first to establish a specific regulatory pathway for biosimilars. In 2001, Directive 2001/83/EC provided the legal basis for approval of biosimilars in the EU.", "The directive allowed the EMA to draft the first biosimilar guideline and publish in 2005, after resolution of the Eprex PRCA outbreak.", "The guideline outlined the basic principles of the EU biosimilar regulatory approach; specifically, demonstrating similarity of a biosimilar with its reference product in terms of quality, safety, and efficacy through analytical and clinical studies.[32]", "One year later, the EMA adopted biosimilar guidelines to address issues in analytical studies (e.g., selection of a reference product, methods, and product characterization, and demonstration of biological activity and purity) as well as nonclinical and clinical studies (e.g., pharmacotoxicological assessment, pharmacokinetics, efficacy, and safety).[33] An additional guideline tackled the need for post-approval safety monitoring and a risk-management plan that highlights immunogenicity.[34]", "The EMA has also developed class-specific guidelines for recombinant erythropoietins, interferon β, and, more recently, monoclonal antibodies.[34–36] Of note is the significant role that the outbreak of PRCA, after a manufacturing change with Eprex, played in development of the biosimilar guidelines for EPO.", "Interestingly, the definition of a biosimilar is not a consensus by regulatory authorities and each country adopts its own (Table 2).", "In 2009, the WHO published a guideline that presents globally acceptable principles to license biosimilars that can be adapted to meet the needs of regulatory authorities in countries with no published guidance.[37]", "The guideline is thought to be an initial step in the harmonization to evaluate and regulate biosimilars, and several countries have adopted its principles to elaborate their own guidelines, including Canada, South Korea, and Brazil to name a few.[38]", "Despite the existence of slight differences in the scope of available guidelines, the basic principles governing regulatory requirements for biosimilars are of a similar nature across different nations.[38,39] This generally includes preclinical and clinical comparability studies to demonstrate safety and efficacy as well as post-manufacturing assays to examine immunogenicity.", "| Europe | EMA | Biosimilar | A biological medicinal product that contains a version of the active substance of an already authorized original biological medicinal product (reference medicinal product).", "Similarity to the reference medicinal product in terms of quality characteristics, biological activity, safety and efficacy based on a comprehensive comparability exercise needs to be established.", "| Global | WHO | Similar biotherapeutic product | A biotherapeutic product similar to an already licensed reference biotherapeutic product in terms of quality, safety and efficacy.", "| United States | FDA | Follow-on biologic or biosimilar | A biological product that is highly similar to a US- licensed reference biological product notwithstanding minor differences in clinically inactive components, and for which there are no clinically meaningful differences between the biological product and the reference product in terms of the safety, purity, and potency of the product.", "| Canada | Health Canada | Subsequent-entry biologic | A biologic product that is similar to and would enter the market subsequent to an approved innovator biologic product.", "| Korea | MFDS | Biosimilar | Biological products which demonstrated its equivalence to an already approved reference product with regard to quality, safety, and efficacy.", "| Brazil | ANVISA | Biologic product | A biologic medicine with known biologic activity that contains no new molecules, already licensed in Brazil and that has gone through all the production steps (including formulation, vialing, freeze drying, labeling, packaging, storage, quality control and biologic product lot release.", "Abbreviations: ANVISA, Agencia de Vigilancia Sanitaria;

involved important identified risks, 40% important potential risks, and 20% missing information.", "For the discontinuation of aRMMs, the sources of evidence were a non-clinical study (25%) and an observational study (25%).", "The observational study was a multi-database drug-utilisation study for indacaterol maleate, which was authorised only for use in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and had aRMMs to reduce the risks associated with off-label use in asthma; the authors concluded that there was little to no off-label use of indacaterol in the EU [10].", "The data sources could not be identified in two products (50%).", "The aim of our study was to describe discontinuations and introductions of aRMMs post-authorisation for centrally authorised medicinal products in the EU.", "We assessed the probability of post-authorisation introduction or discontinuation of aRMMs, rather than proportions, to account for the time required to accumulate sufficient data as justification for an introduction or discontinuation.", "During the study period, the probability of post-authorisation introduction of aRMMs was 3.5% (95% CI 1.2–5.7) within 5 years and 6.9% (95% CI 2.6–11) within 10 years after authorisation, while the probability of discontinuation of aRMMs was 0.9% (95% CI 0–2.6) within 5 years and 8.3% (95% CI 0–16.1) within 10 years after authorisation.", "The probability of introduction of aRMMs within 5 and 10 years in our study is low. Besides introduction of aRMMs, regulatory action for safety issues emerging post-authorisation may include further investigation/monitoring, changes to routine risk minimisation measures, or suspension/revocation of the MA.", "Studies have shown that the vast majority of important post-authorisation safety issues are either investigated further or monitored, or are sufficiently minimised through routine risk minimisation measures [11].", "Moreover, the probability of introduction of aRMMs within 5 and 10 years post-authorisation found in our study is lower than the probability of safety-related DHPC post-authorisation in a study that investigated whether the probability of DHPCs increased with increasing level of innovation of medicines [12].", "DHPCs are listed as a type of aRMM in GVP module XVI rev 2, but differ from the aRMMs investigated in our study due to their one-off mode of action and broader scope of use.", "Between 1 January 1999 and 1 January 2009, 157 DHPCs were sent out for 112 different active substances available in the Netherlands, and 131 DHPCs were issued between 1 January 2010 and 31 December 2014 in the UK.", "Spontaneous reports and clinical trials were the most frequent triggers for introduction of post-authorisation aRMMs in our study.", "These findings are comparable with results of other studies, in which spontaneous reports and post-marketing clinical trials are the most frequent sources of new safety information post-authorisation.", "aRMMs were imposed on one medicine in our study (gadoversetamide) following a review of the benefit–risk balance of gadolinium-containing contrast agents, i.e. a referral procedure.", "Although several referrals were conducted and concluded during the study period, these concerned medicines approved before our study period (such as vitamin A derivatives) or medicines not approved centrally (such as sodium valproate).", "In addition, some referrals did not lead to imposition of aRMMs, such as both referrals concerning sodium glucose co-transporter 2 inhibitors.", "The probability of discontinuation observed in our study is low compared to the discontinuation rates reported in literature for the United States Food and Drug Administration’s (FDA) Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategies (REMS).", "Studies have reported discontinuation rates of REMS between 57 and 75%, with an average time to REMS discontinuation of 1.7 years [15–17].", "Median time to discontinuation of aRMMs in our study was 7.5 years. However, when comparing discontinuation rates of aRMMs in the EU and REMS in the USA, some key factors should be considered.", "First and most importantly, medication guides (paper handouts which may help patients avoid serious risks) were considered a REMS until November 2011, when the FDA released new guidance clarifying that medication guides may not always be a REMS [18].", "In one study, almost all the discontinued REMS consisted of only a medication guide [15]. The high reported rate of REMS discontinuation may be partly explained by re-evaluation of these medication guide–only REMS.", "Second, the high discontinuation rates reported for REMS included multiple product-specific REMS programmes for both innovator and non-innovator medicines with the same active substances and REMS programmes for non-innovator medicinal products containing active substances with a long history of use.", "To avoid multiple counting of aRMMs, we excluded non-innovator medicines from our study, as they are expected to follow the RMP of the reference innovator medicine.", "The discontinuation rate of REMS as reported in the literature is therefore not directly comparable to the discontinuation rate of aRMMs in our study.", "Different conclusions regarding safety between different regulators have been shown to lead to differences in frequency, timing, and content of safety communications both within the EU and between the USA, Canada, and the UK", "[14, 19]. This may also impact the decision to require or discontinue either aRMMs or REMS. Lastly, REMS requirements include mandatory assessment of the effectiveness of the measures after 18 months, 3 years, and 7 years.", "In contrast, timelines for evaluation of effectiveness of aRMMs are determined on a case-by-case basis, although GVP module XVI rev 2 provides guidance on time points of particular interest, namely 1 year after implementation and 5 years after MA [4].", "Evaluation of the effectiveness of risk minimisation programmes became mandatory with amendments to the EU’s pharmaceutical legislation in 2012, with updated guidelines highlighting the importance of evaluation of effectiveness of aRMMs [1].", "Studies have found that effectiveness of aRMMs is evaluated through routine pharmacovigilance for more than half of the products with aRMMs", "[7, 20]. Recent reviews of studies evaluating the effectiveness of product-specific risk minimisation measures have shown heterogeneous methodology and mixed study outcomes [21–23].", "In one review of effectiveness evaluation studies, the outcome of effectiveness evaluations led to discontinuation of the aRMMs under investigation in 9% of effectiveness evaluation studies.", "Further action such as updates to the content or improved distribution or follow-up assessment was required following half of the evaluations, and the evaluation did not lead to any changes in the remaining 40%", "[24]. However, these reviews concerned effectiveness evaluations in a subset of medicines (those intended for chronic treatment) or have been conducted using data available in the EU PAS register [21–24].", "They may not provide an exhaustive overview of all effectiveness studies performed in the EU, since registration in the EU PAS register is only mandatory for studies imposed on the MA or studies that are a specific obligation to the MA—effectiveness evaluation studies rarely fall in these categories [25].", "In our study, effectiveness evaluation was the trigger for only one discontinuation (Hirobriz breezhaler).", "This effectiveness evaluation study was not registered in the EU PAS register.", "Notably, GVP module V was updated in 2017 to emphasise that aRMMs may be discontinued when no longer considered necessary; thus, we expect the probability of discontinuation of aRMMs to rise in the coming years [3].", "Our study has limitations. First, we did not include DHPCs in our study as they differ substantially from the other aRMM modalities due their non-recurring nature and broader scope of use.", "Importantly, DHPCs are the only type of aRMM that are not recorded in annex IID of the MA, and information on issued DHPCs is not systematically reflected on the EMA website.", "Although several national competent authorities publish DHPCs on their websites, studies have shown inconsistencies between national competent authorities with regard to dissemination and content of DHPCs [19].", "Second, our study included only centrally authorised products in the EU. However, due to the mandatory scope of the central procedure, the majority of new active substances approved during the study period is expected to be included in our study [1].", "In addition, the vast majority (80–98%) of medicines approved through national, mutual recognition and decentralised procedures concern non-innovator applications such as generics: in 2018, 80–98% of the applications submitted to the Coordination Group for Mutual Recognition and Decentralised Procedures over the year 2018 concerned non-innovator applications.", "We excluded non-innovator products as their EU-RMP should be in line with the EU-RMP of the reference product.", "Third, our study was conducted with publicly available data. The structure and quality of the EPARs, in particular the “EPAR—Public Assessment Report”, evolved over time to include more information in a standardised manner.", "Particularly for the first part of the study period, identifying aRMMs at the time of MA could be challenging, leading us to develop the two-step approach we used in this study.", "Although there is residual potential for misclassification, for instance, if the content of the EPARs is not updated correctly, this probability is considered to be small.", "We found low probabilities of introduction and discontinuation of aRMMs (excluding DHPCs) during the product life cycle for medicines authorised between 2006 and 2017.", "The low probability of discontinuation may be due to lack of robust data on effectiveness of aRMMs. Further research is needed to get more insight into the dynamics of aRMMs during the medicine life cycle.", "The authors would like to thank Dr. Fakhredin Sayed Tabatabaei and Dr. Liana Gross-Martirosyan for their input.", "No sources of funding were used to assist in the preparation of this study.", "The authors report no conflicts of interests in relation to this study.

The world’s largest pharmaceutical companies, skilled at creating drugs for the heart, lungs and joints, couldn’t find the same success in the brain, leading them to either pull back or shutter development over the last decade.", "A handful have kept brain drugs a focus, but that’s in stark contrast to 25 years ago, when almost every major developer was pouring money in.", "Sales of Eli Lilly’s Prozac enticed rivals to find their own blockbuster antidepressants. Pfizer then brought Zoloft to market, followed by GlaxoSmithKline with Paxil.", "By the early 2000s, a new wave of antipsychotics was helping build multibillion-dollar neurology businesses for AstraZeneca and Bristol-Myers Squibb.", "But AstraZeneca, Bristol-Myers, GSK and, most recently, Pfizer and Amgen no longer devote significant resources to neuroscience.", "Others, such as Lilly, Sanofi and Merck & Co., have narrowed their investments and number of drug programs.", "Often these retreats came after a series of clinical failures that called into question whether money would be better spent elsewhere.", "Neuroscience still receives healthy levels of early investment, though. It attracted $1.5 billion from venture capitalists in 2018, putting it second only to cancer and suggesting these financiers expect payoffs in the not-too-distant future, perhaps through a big pharma buyout.", "Their bet may be well placed too, as industry watchers foresee big pharma mounting a return to neuroscience in the next few years, lured by emerging treatments for epilepsy, mood disorders and genetic diseases of the CNS, or central nervous system.", "Though cancer draws the lion’s share of venture capital dollars, brain drugs also attract significant funding.", "Venture funding, in billions, by therapeutic area.

Click on a therapeutic area to highlight related venture funding.", "“My prediction is that within the next five years, and certainly within the next 10 years, you’re going to see another golden era of these neuroscience products,” said Steven Paul, who was at Lilly when it developed the blockbuster antipsychotic Zyprexa and now serves as CEO of the neuroscience biotech Karuna Therapeutics.", "Paul isn’t alone in that view. Earlier this month, the CEO of Roche Pharmaceuticals said the 2020s could see neuroscience make the same kind of enormous strides that oncology did during the 2010s.", "Jeremy Levin, head of neurology-focused Ovid Therapeutics and chair to biotech’s largest trade group, expects “radical” new therapies to emerge even quicker, likely in the next three years.", "Overall, nearly a dozen industry executives and analysts who spoke with BioPharma Dive envision brain drugs making a comeback soon, and with big pharma in tow.", "“This is a repeated pattern that you see in the industry,” Levin said in an interview. “People leave things alone, they think it’s a waste of time, waste of money.", "Then they see some success. The smart big companies dive in, buy the companies out or board with them, and the result is a complete break-open of the field.”", "Recent exits, however, could hint that neuroscience isn’t yet seen as a near-term opportunity.", "Amgen terminated drug programs in schizophrenia and Alzheimer’s disease before leaving neuroscience almost entirely in late 2019.", "The biotech’s head of R&D, David Reese, told BioPharma Dive how the exit rested on several factors, including the industry’s “fairly rudimentary” understanding of neurological diseases, the long development programs some of these drugs require, as well as the clearer opportunities Amgen saw with oncology, inflammation and cardiovascular medicines.", "Reese also said his company didn’t want to invest 10 years and billions of dollars in an area so “fraught with uncertainty,” and therefore concluded that standing up biotechs or establishing public-private partnerships would be more encouraging approaches.", "Pfizer’s story was similar. It had drugs fail in Alzheimer’s and Huntington’s disease in the years leading up to 2018, when the company decided to take a handful of compounds and create a CNS-focused spin-out with Bain Capital.", "Pfizer said the move allowed it to redirect money to areas of greater expertise.", "Across neuroscience, clinical failures have stacked up because drugmakers didn’t know enough about how the diseases work.", "These failures then made further investments a riskier proposition for big pharma.", "At the same time, researchers were developing impressive new drugs in different diseases, most notably cancer, which spurred large companies to re-prioritize.", "Since most didn’t have an extensive list of promising brain drugs, neuroscience proved easier research to discontinue.", "Now, a consequence of the reprioritization is a relative lack of big pharma resources invested in developing new, effective therapies for some of the world’s most common illnesses.", "While “me-too” cancer drugs proliferate, there are few, if any, novel treatments for diseases like Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s and depression, each of which affect millions of patients.", "A handful of large pharmas still consider neuroscience a focus area", "Each square represents a large pharmaceutical company that focuses on the selected therapeutic area. Click on other therapeutic areas to highlight the companies at work in each field.", "“It wasn’t about exiting neuroscience,” Levin said. “It was about not taking risks and, as a consequence, diverting cash into areas that they think are going to be incredibly productive in the near-term.“", "Executives at small biotechs, though, say it’ll take just a few positive studies for the giants to come back.", "That’s been true with gene therapy as well as immuno-oncology, which produced some of the world’s best-selling drugs, including Merck’s Keytruda and Bristol-Myers’ Opdivo.", "“This is a business of momentum, and you don’t want to be left out,” said Richard Peters, former head of rare diseases at Sanofi Genzyme and current CEO of Yumanity, a biotech making drugs for neurodegenerative illnesses.", "“So if you see a few successes, boards of directors at these companies are quickly going to ask management, ‘Why aren’t we doing that?’”", "That pressure may explain why many big pharma companies continue to study Alzheimer’s drugs even if they’re not deeply involved in neuroscience.", "Analysts expect the first Alzheimer’s treatment on the market that shows an effect on the disease, rather than just its symptoms, would become an instant blockbuster.", "Yet neurodegenerative disorders like Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s have proven exceptionally challenging, due in part to their tangled biological roots.", "AstraZeneca, Lilly, Merck, Novartis, Pfizer and Roche each saw experimental Alzheimer’s treatments fail in late-stage testing.", "Biogen, a top player in neuroscience, plans on asking regulators to greenlight a drug that works in a similar way to its peers’ failed attempts, but controversial clinical data make its efficacy the subject of intense debate.", "Though an Alzheimer’s solution looks far off, drugmakers have notched victories in other neurological diseases like spinal muscular atrophy, in which a genetic defect causes patients’ muscles to waste away.", "Effective therapies from Biogen and Novartis have come to market since the end of 2016, and a third from Roche could be approved before June.", "Drugmakers now have better tools to manipulate and correct genes than in the 1990s and early 2000s. As a result, diseases tied to single genetic defects, such as spinal muscular atrophy, seem easier to target and less risky — attributes that would appeal to large players looking for an entry point back into neuroscience.", "There are already a couple examples of this, with Pfizer getting into Duchenne muscular dystrophy through its acquisition of Bamboo Therapeutics and Roche showing interest in a Huntington’s program developed by Ionis Pharmaceuticals.", "Besides Biogen and Roche, large drugmakers have advanced only a few neurology drugs into late-stage testing", "Chart shows the number of neuroscience programs by study stage.

Use the dropdown to see how many programs for each company are at each stage of clinical testing.", "That’s not to say these illnesses are easily treatable. The newfound excitement around Huntington’s, for example, belies the fact that no drug has yet been proven to change the course of the disease.", "“My cautionary point on the whole hype-train surrounding monogenic CNS diseases is: the more we’ve dug into them, the more we’ve realized they’re not as simple as you might hope,” Stifel analyst Paul Matteis said.", "Even so, Matteis said monogenic diseases would be a reasonable place for big pharma to invest as it rebuilds in neuroscience.", "But past that broad category, there’s not much consensus. Levin from Ovid sees epilepsy as a promising target, as do others, but believes psychiatric breakthroughs will be harder to find.", "Karuna’s Paul disagrees, and says the industry is “right on the verge of having very positive” late-stage data in depression and schizophrenia.", "Such forecasts are perhaps to be expected: Levin’s company is developing an epilepsy drug while Paul’s is working on a schizophrenia medication.", "Drugmaking technologies may also be more valuable than the specific disease target. Ted Dawson, director of the Institute for Cell Engineering at Johns Hopkins Medicine, says he’s seen “an enormous amount of excitement” around antisense therapies that regulate gene expression.", "Ionis’ business revolves around the antisense platform responsible for developing Biogen’s muscular atrophy drug, while Alnylam Pharmaceuticals has a similar platform that’s at the center of a $1 billion CNS research pact with Regeneron.", "Analysts note that any reinvestment in neuroscience will depend on big pharma’s goals. If a company’s aim is to make brain drugs a core part of its business, then a single, small disease that has no relationship to anything else in its pipeline might be an unlikely target.", "If that’s not the plan, a company may be fine acquiring a niche, low-risk product, with the potential to tuck it into a broader platform later.", "In any case, analysts say big pharma’s interest in neuroscience, if renewed, wouldn’t be focused on just large markets, but also extend to incredibly small, or orphan, diseases.", "Drugs for those conditions come with regulatory incentives and can be sold at high price tags, potentially making an investment more attractive.", "“These days, it does seem like pharma is increasingly interested in the orphan business model,” Phil Nadeau of investment bank Cowen & Co said.", "“If there were products that seemed like they’d be very successful orphan therapies in neuroscience, I think pharma would probably be interested in acquiring those.”", "Acquisitions, as Nadeau points out, would hallmark a big pharma return. Since many large developers don’t have deep research and commercialization teams in neuroscience, a buyout would likely be faster than building from the ground up.", "“It certainly seems like a device that companies have used time and again to quickly get back into an area they’ve exited,” Nadeau said.", "Deals, though, carry risk even when the science appears validated. Last spring, SVB Leerink analyzed transactions done by the 21 largest drug companies and found just one-third of deals valued at $1 billion or more were “unequivocally successful,” meaning they resulted in new products or better-than-expected revenue growth.", "“A skeptic would say the return on invested capital of acquisitions in the biopharma industry is relatively poor.", "So although it may be quicker, it may not be better,” Nadeau said.", "Whether they’re good for the target companies is also up for debate. Many potential buyers wouldn’t have a neuroscience infrastructure for a newly acquired biotech to latch onto, which might make integration more complicated.", "There are also concerns that, after the initial wave of excitement, big pharma might retreat again if positive data and drug approvals don’t come steadily.", "“The risk is pharma swoops in and buys companies at lower valuations, extracts the value, and then you might be in the cycle,” Vlad Coric, CEO of Connecticut-based Biohaven Pharmaceutical, told BioPharma Dive.", "“They’ll keep you as long as neuroscience is important to them, and then they’ll be out of it again.”", "These worries, combined with easy access to money from venture capital or public markets, may force big pharma to craft better sales pitches if they want to court neuroscience biotechs.", "“Capital markets have opened up sufficiently, at least in the United States, to allow for companies to take action themselves,” Levin said.", "“You don’t need big pharma’s confidence restored” in neuroscience, he added."]}

If discoveries were universally available without a means for the inventor to realize a return on investments, most commentators are convinced that there would result a \"much lower and indeed suboptimal level of innovation.\"41", "Although research is often important to innovation, it appears that, on average, it constitutes approximately 25% of the cost of commercializing a new technology or technique, thus requiring the expenditure of a substantial amount of additional resources to bring most products or processes to the marketplace.", "The grant of a patent provides the inventor with a mechanism to capture the returns to his invention through exclusive rights on its practice for 20 years from date of filing.", "That is intended to encourage those investments necessary to further develop an idea and generate a marketable technology.", "The utility of patents to companies varies among industrial sectors. Patents are perceived as critical in the drug and chemical industries.", "That may reflect the nature of R&D performed in these sectors, where the results often are relatively easy to reproduce.42 Others have pointed out that drug patents are more detailed in their claims and therefore easier to defend.43 In contrast, studies have found that in many other industries the protection offered by patents is diminished by the ability to invent around the patent and limited by the disclosure of vital information in the patent itself.44 In the aircraft and semiconductor industries patents have not been the most successful mechanism for capturing the benefits of investments.", "Instead, lead time and the strength of the learning curve were determined to be more important.45 According to one study, in the semiconductor and related equipment industry, secrecy and lead time were deemed significantly more important than patents.", "Similar findings characterize the aerospace and machine tool industries, among others.46 The degree to which industry perceives patents as effective has been characterized as \"positively correlated with the increase in duplication costs and time associated with patents.", "The patent system has dual policy goals—providing incentives for inventors to invent and encouraging inventors to disclose technical information.48 Disclosure requirements are factors in achieving a balance between current and future innovation through the patent process, as are limitations on scope, novelty mandates, and nonobviousness considerations.49 Patents can give rise to an environment of competitiveness with multiple sources of innovation, which is viewed by some experts as the basis for technological progress.", "This is important because, as Professors Robert Merges and Richard Nelson found in their studies, in a situation where only \"a few organizations controlled the development of a technology, technical advance appeared sluggish.", "The patent system has long been subject to criticism, however. Some observers have asserted that the patent system is unnecessary due to market forces that already suffice to create an optimal level of innovation.", "The desire to obtain a lead time advantage over competitors, as well as the recognition that technologically backward firms lose out to their rivals, may well provide sufficient inducement to invent without the need for further incentives.51 Other commentators believe that the patent system encourages industry concentration and presents a barrier to entry in some markets.52 Still other observers believe that the patent system too frequently attracts speculators who prefer to acquire and enforce patents rather than engage in socially productive activity.53", "When analyzing the validity of these competing views, it is important to note the lack of rigorous analytical methods available for studying the effect of the patent law upon the U.S. economy as a whole.", "The relationship between innovation and patent rights remains poorly understood. As a result, current economic and policy tools do not allow us to calibrate the patent system precisely in order to produce an optimal level of investment in innovation.", "Thus, each of the arguments for and against the patent system remains open to challenge by those who are unpersuaded by their internal logic.", "Reflecting the importance of cooperative R&D to the government, a series of legislative provisions use intellectual property rights to foster collaboration between all the parties in the research and development enterprise leading to the generation of new and improved products and processes for the marketplace.", "Both P.L. 96-480, the Stevenson-Wydler Technology Innovation Act (known as the \"Stevenson-Wydler Act\"),54 as amended, and P.L. 96-517, Amendments to the Patent and Trademark Act (commonly referred to as the \"Bayh-Dole Act\" after its two main sponsors, former Senators Birch Bayh and Robert Dole),55 are the basis for efforts at using patents and licensing to facilitate cooperative R&D, technology transfer, and the commercialization of technology supported by the federal government.", "These laws affect the way the National Institutes of Health, and other government agencies, interact with the academic community and industry in the R&D arena.", "It is in this area where the sometimes competing goals of prescription drug cost containment and encouragement of technology-based innovations may conflict.", "While the result of different legislative histories and concerns, the Stevenson-Wydler Act and the Bayh-Dole Act were passed to encourage the use of technologies funded by and/or developed by the federal government in pursuit of the departments' and agencies' mission requirements.", "However, they address intellectual property issues that arise from different R&D relationships.

other words, public support of quasi-public goods must be balanced by some degree of public sharing in the fruits of the investment, as well as input into the nature of that sharing.\"", "Critics of policies to recoup federal research support or government involvement in pricing decisions argue that advocates of such actions misunderstand the actual nature of the NIH role in research and pharmaceutical development.", "They maintain that federal support for basic research reflects a consensus that such work is critical because it is the foundation for many new innovations and that any returns created by this activity are generally long term, sometimes not marketable, and not always evident.", "Yet the rate of return to society as a whole generated by investments in research is significantly larger than the benefits that can be captured by the firm performing the work.", "According to a study by Professors Iain Cockburn and Rebecca Henderson, the rate of return to government funded biomedical research may be 30% a year, a figure that may actually be higher because calculations do not account for the broader effects of pharmaceutical innovation on health and well-being.123", "The National Institutes of Health funds \"basic research aimed at understanding biological mechanisms and gaining knowledge for which no immediate application is apparent has been a vital supply of new ideas, and can only be sustained through public support.\"124", "This fundamental knowledge contributes to the general pool of knowledge which industry may use to generate specific products.", "In the health-related arena, NIH supports research, primarily at universities, directed at the underlying mechanisms of disease: research and knowledge that are applied by the private sector to develop specific treatments for disease.125 Studies demonstrate the \"important role that the public sector plays in providing fundamental insights in basic knowledge as a basis for drug discovery.\"126", "The basic research \"feeds an independent step in the discovery process called the 'drug concept' or 'rock turning' period ...", "[which] is the very first point in the pharmaceutical innovative process and necessarily precedes chemical synthesis.\"127", "This research generally is composed of work supported by the government and publicly available as well as knowledge resulting from internal firm R&D.128", "The information and concepts generated by this research have a \"substantial impact\" on pharmaceutical R&D.129", "The research supported and conducted by the NIH is sometimes mischaracterized as necessarily resulting in the commercialization of drug products.", "In truth, much of NIH funding supports the exploration of fundamental biological mechanisms that would otherwise not be pursued due to the lack of market incentives.", "Such research can lead to early-stage findings and provide clues that may eventually lead to medical advancements for diseases for which existing methods of therapy are nonexistent, inefficient, or suitable only for a select population.130", "This is not to imply that the private sector does little in relation to the government in the pharmaceutical arena.", "Pharmaceutical companies spend more than NIH on R&D, primarily for applied research and development directed at generating new drugs for the marketplace.", "Some analysts argue that the federal role is overstated because existing studies use citations as a measure of each sector's contribution to drug development.", "This, critics maintain, skews the results because the government encourages, and even requires, publication of research results while industry often discourages such practices.131", "What appears to be the case is that benefits move in both directions between the government and the private sector.132 A comprehensive study by NIH of five top selling drugs demonstrated \"that public and private sector biomedical research are interwoven, complementary parts of the highly successful U.S. biomedical science endeavor.\"133", "Taking the results of this study further, Janice Reichert and Christopher-Paul Milne of the Tufts Center for the Study of Drug Development at Tufts University noted that for the set of drugs looked at by NIH, the government's involvement", "was greatest in the preclinical and clinical development of drugs that were treatments for serious or life-threatening diseases ...", "[where] there was clearly a public health benefit derived from facilitating the development of these drugs.", "The NIH was also involved in the discovery and/or development of compounds that were in the \"public domain\" (i.e., knowledge of the existence and method of preparation of the compounds was publicly available before therapeutic potential was identified) ...", "These types of compounds initially might not have been of interest to the pharmaceutical industry, because possible patent claims were limited.134", "Those who oppose changes in the current approach to intellectual property ownership of the results of federally funded R&D argue that the promise of a large return on investment \"is precisely the tool sanctioned by the Constitution to promote the progress of science.\"135", "It is because pharmaceuticals and biotechnology are so research intensive that they rely heavily on patents.", "Intellectual property is important because the \"costs of drug innovation are very high while the costs of imitation are relatively low.\"136", "The domestic pharmaceutical industry typically reinvests 8% to 20% of its revenues in R&D, and oftentimes substantially more, in contrast to other industries where the rates are about 3% to 4%, according to testimony presented by Dr. Arthur Levinson, CEO of Genentech.137 Ownership of intellectual property is particularly important to biotechnology companies that typically are small and do not have profits to finance additional R&D.", "According to the Biotechnology Industry Organization, most of these firms finance research and development from equity capital not profits.", "Only 5% of biotech companies have sales and therefore depend on venture capital and IPOs.138 Industry advocates maintain the patents are a necessity for raising this equity capital and that price controls would deter investors.139 Thus, some experts maintain that \"the ability of companies to control their discoveries through the establishment of intellectual property rights is fundamental to the competitiveness of [such] industry.\"140", "Elimination of the incentives associated with technology transfer and increased R&D through patent ownership and control over intellectual property would reduce innovation according to many experts.", "Columbia University's Frank Lichtenberg states that \"weakening patent protection (e.g. by government violation of patents) may have a chilling effect on private R&D investment, and therefore reduce the health and wealth of future generations.\"141", "A similar opinion was expressed by John E. Calfee of the American Enterprise Institute. Noting that, \"one of the least-appreciated effects of faster research and development is to quicken the competitive process itself,\" Calfee argues that \"although the scientific effort required for new drugs costs a great deal of money, the drugs are worth far more than they cost.", "Eliminate the financial reward, however, and you cut off the supply.\"142", "Dr. M. Kathy Behrens, a director of the National Venture Capital Association, testified at hearings before the Joint Economic Committee on September 29, 1999, that \"health care proposals which impose drug price controls, or Medicare drug benefits which provide marginal reimbursement, can create a perception or reality that the industry's potential return is limited or at greater risk.\"143", "Other experts concur with this assessment. Research undertaken by Professor John Vernon found \"that pharmaceutical price regulation has a negative effect on firm R&D investment ...", "[and] could impose a very high cost in terms of foregone medical innovation. \"144 One study has suggested that the threat of price controls during the first Clinton Administration had a detrimental effect on private sector support of pharmaceutical research and development.145", "Actual experience and cited studies suggest that companies which do not control the results of their investments—either through ownership of patent title, exclusive license, or pricing decisions—tend to be less likely to engage in related R&D.", "This likelihood is reflected in the provisions of the Bayh-Dole Act (as well as other laws). Providing universities, nonprofit institutions, and small businesses with title to patents arising from federally funded R&D offers an incentive for cooperative work and commercial application.", "Royalties derived from intellectual property rights provide the academic community an alternative way to support further research and the business sector a means to obtain a return on its financial contribution to the endeavor.", "While the idea of recoupment was considered by Congress in hearings on the legislation prior to the act's passage in 1980, it was rejected as an unnecessary obstacle, one which would be perceived as an additional burden to working with the government.", "Policy makers thought such a program to be particularly difficult to administer.146 Instead, Congress accepted as satisfactory the anticipated payback to the country through increased revenues from taxes on profits, new jobs created, improved productivity, and economic growth.", "For example, according to the MIT Technology Licensing Office, in 1998, 15% of the sales of licensed products derived from federally funded university research was returned to the government in the form of income taxes, payroll taxes, capital gains taxes, and corporate income taxes.", "This was estimated to be six times the royalties paid by companies to the universities.147 The emergence of the biotechnology industry and the development of new therapeutics to improve health care are often cited indications of such benefits.", "The focus on intellectual property ownership of the results of federally funded R&D has led some critics to charge that the patenting of fundamental research prevents further biomedical innovation.", "Law professors Rebecca Eisenberg and Arti Rai argue that due to implementation of the Bayh-Dole Act \"proprietary claims have increasingly moved upstream from the end products themselves to the ground-breaking discoveries that made them possible in the first place.\"148", "While patents are designed to spur innovation, Rai and Eisenberg maintain that certain patents hinder the process.", "From their perspective, permitting universities to patent discoveries made under federal funding, the Bayh-Dole Act \"draws no distinction between inventions that lead directly to commercial products and fundamental advances that enable further scientific studies.\"149", "These basic innovations are generally known as \"research tools.\"", "Eisenberg and Professor Richard Nelson argue that ownership of research tools may \"impose significant transaction costs\" that result in delayed innovation and possible future litigation.150 It also can stand in the way of research by others:", "Broad claims on early discoveries that are fundamental to emerging fields of knowledge are particularly worrisome in light of the great value, demonstrated time and again in history of science and technology, of having many independent minds at work trying to advance a field.", "Public science has flourished by permitting scientists to challenge and build upon the work of rivals.151", "Similar concerns were expressed by Harold Varmus, president of Memorial Sloan-Kettering and former director of the National Institutes of Health.", "In July 2000 prepared testimony, he spoke to being \"troubled by widespread tendencies to seek protection of intellectual property increasingly early in the process that ultimately leads to products of obvious commercial value, because such practices can have detrimental effects on science and its delivery of health benefits.\"152", "While the Bayh-Dole Act and scientific advances have helped generate a dynamic biotechnology industry, there have been changes that \"are not always consistent with the best interests of science.", "However, as Varmus and others acknowledge, the remedies to this situation are not necessarily associated with the Bayh-Dole Act or its implementation by NIH.", "Yale President Richard Levin notes that while some research should be kept in the public domain, including research tools, the fact that it is privatized is not the result of the Bayh-Dole Act, but rather the result of patent law made by the courts and Congress.", "Therefore, he believes that changes to the act are not the appropriate means to address the issues.154", "Current law, as reaffirmed by court decisions, permits the patenting of research tools. However, there have been efforts to encourage the widespread availability of these tools.", "Marie Freire, formerly director of the Office of Technology Transfer at NIH, testified that the value to society is greatest if the research tools are easily available for use in research.", "She asserted that there is a need to balance commercial interests with public interests.155 To achieve this balance, the National Institutes of Health has developed guidelines for universities and companies receiving federal funding that make clear research tools are to be made available to other scientists under reasonable terms.156", "In 1999, NIH issued a policy paper, Sharing of Biomedical Research Resources, Principles and Guidelines for Recipients of NIH Research Grants and Contracts, which \"calls for the sharing of [research] tools among non-profit organizations with minimal terms and impediments.\"157", "This approach, now included as a requirement in NIH grants, is reflective of subsequent changes to the Bayh-Dole Act that stated the results of the federal R&D enterprise should be achieved \"without unduly encumbering future research and discovery.\"158", "In addition, the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office made changes in the guidelines used to determine the patentability of biotechnology discoveries.", "A study by Professors John Walsh, Ashish Arora, and Wesley Cohen found that although there are now more patents associated with biomedical research, and on more fundamental work, there is little evidence that work has been curtailed due to intellectual property issues associated with research tools.159 According to this view, scientists are able to continue their research by \"licensing, inventing around patents, going offshore, the development and use of public databases and research tools, court challenges, and simply using the technology without a license (i.e., infringement).\"", "According to the authors of the report, private sector owners of patents permitted such infringement in academia (with the exception of those associated with diagnostic tests in clinical trials) \"partly because it can increase the value of the patented technology.\"", "The government retains certain rights under the Bayh-Dole Act to protect the public interest. The act states that the government is provided a \"nonexclusive, nontransferable, irrevocable, paid-up license to practice or have practiced for or on behalf of the United States any subject invention throughout the world.\"", "This license, commonly known as a \"royalty free license,\" has been the subject of some discussion including whether or not this permits government purchasers to obtain discounts on products developed from federally funded R&D, particularly pharmaceuticals.", "A July 2003 GAO report addressed this issue and concluded that the license entitles the government to practice or have practiced the invention on the government's behalf, but \"does not give the federal government the far broader right to purchase, 'off the shelf' and royalty free (i.e. at a discounted price), products that happen to incorporate a federally funded invention when they are not produced under the government's license.\"160", "The study states that rights in one patent do not \"automatically\" permit rights in subsequent, related patents.161 Because the government apparently holds few licenses on the biomedical products it purchases (generally through the Veteran's Administration and the Department of Defense),162 federal officials indicated that procurement costs were best reduced by use of the Federal Supply Schedule and national contracts.163 Government licenses are used primarily in the performance of research in the biomedical area.164", "A related issue is that of tracking the government's interest in patents resulting from federally funded research and development.", "Under the Bayh-Dole Act, grantees are required to report annually on the utilization of any invention arising from federally funded R&D. The Code of Federal Regulations (37 CFR 404.14(h))", "states that these \"reports shall include information regarding the status of development, date of first commercial sale or use, gross royalties received by the contractor, and such other data and information the agency may reasonably specify.\"", "[emphasis added] In an August 1999 study, GAO noted that federal contractors and grantees were not meeting the reporting requirements associated with the Bayh-Dole Act, making it difficult to identify and assess what licenses the government retained, among other things.165 Three years later, in a follow-up report, GAO stated that four of the five agencies had taken steps to insure improved compliance with the law including several new monitoring systems, although more needed to be done.166 To keep track of inventions subject to the Bayh-Dole Act, in 1995 NIH created Interagency Edison (iEdison), an Internet-based reporting system (that is also used by other federal agencies).", "In response to the findings of GAO, suggestions by the NIH Interagency Edison Working Group, and recommendations contained in the report A Plan to Ensure Taxpayers' Interests are Protected, new reporting requirements were implemented effective January 1, 2002, that include \"the commercial name of any FDA-approved products, utilizing any subject invention, which have reached the market during the annual reporting period.", "To date, the U.S. system of research, development, and commercialization has had a clear impact on the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries.", "Policies concerning funding for research, intellectual property protection, and cooperative R&D have played an important part in the economic success of these sectors.168 American pharmaceutical firms have \"consistently maintained a competitive edge in international markets\" and lead in new drug discoveries.169", "According to industry sources, U.S. investment in health-related R&D exceeds all other countries170 and has demonstrated a pattern of R&D investment that has increased at approximately twice the rate of R&D growth in Europe.171", "Incentives for innovation in the industrial community clearly have contributed to substantial research and development by the pharmaceutical and biotechnology sectors.", "In 2010, research and development spending by the biopharmaceutical industry in the United States totaled between $67.4 billion and $68.0 billion.172", "Domestic R&D spending for members of the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America (PhRMA) was an estimated $37.4 billion, with 20.3% of domestic sales reinvested in research and development.173 The industry employs approximately 291,000 individuals in highly skilled jobs.174 Public U.S. biotechnology companies spent $17.6 billion on R&D, generated $52.6 billion in product sales, and produced $61.6 billion in revenue during 2010.175 An industry that did not exist 25 years ago, U.S. biotechnology has provided new products and processes for the international marketplace, including more than 200 biotech drugs and vaccines, with potential for many more advances.", "Some observers question whether or not there are unintended consequences to current policies and programs related to innovation that may need to be addressed.", "As discussed in this paper, the current legislative approach promotes the private sector use of the results of federally funded research and development, particularly through incentives to cooperative activities among government, industry, and academia.", "This approach attempts to balance the public's interest in new or improved products and processes for the marketplace with concerns over providing companies valuable benefits without adequate accountability or compensation.", "In general, incentives for the commercialization of government-supported R&D have been created in response to the argument that the economic benefits to the nation's research investment occur when new goods and services are available to meet public demand, create new jobs, improve productivity, and increase our standard of living.", "To date, these potential benefits have been considered more important than the initial cost to the government.", "However, the particular nature of health-related R&D and the substantial federal investment in this area have caused uncertainty over whether or not the present balance is appropriate.", "Critics of the current approach argue that the need for technology development incentives in the pharmaceutical and/or biotechnology sectors is mitigated by industry access to government-supported R&D at no cost, monopoly power through patent protection, and other regulatory and tax advantages.", "They maintain that the benefits to industry are such that the public has the right to expect a more direct financial return for the federal investment and, therefore, the government should be permitted to provide input into certain drug pricing decisions.", "Those who disagree point out that the collaborative public-private environment created by federal policies and practices has generated extraordinary innovation in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries.", "These sectors have provided significant benefits to the health and well-being of the nation.

However, the BPCIA “may expose trade secrets of both originators and biosimilar applicants.”29", "For example, there are “many aspects that could be kept as trade secrets, including precise cell growth conditions, analytical processes, purification process, and even characteristics of the cells that produce the drug.", "”26 Abbott has filed a citizen petition with the FDA, claiming that the BPCIA violates pharmaceutical companies' legal rights by forcing them to divulge trade secrets.30 Abbott claims that “an innovator's resulting license application typically reflects more than a decade of research and contains analytical, preclinical, and clinical data, as well as detailed manufacturing information, most of which qualifies as trade secrets.", "”30 It further argues that even the federal government cannot try to control healthcare costs by taking private property.30", "The claim is that branded companies should have reasonable expectations that their trade secrets will not be used to help their competitors.31 If Abbott's claim is upheld, all biologics that were approved before the BPCIA was enacted would be exempt from the law, and no biosimilar will enter the United States until 2022.", "The biotechnology companies AbbVie and InterMune have sued the EMA in an attempt to block publication of their clinical trial data.32 AbbVie states that it “does not support the disclosure of commercially confidential information ‘that does not meaningfully contribute to the scientific review or evaluation of products.’”32", "The General Court of the EU has issued an interim order that stops the EMA from releasing information on drugs from AbbVie and InterMune.33 The issue concerns releasing “commercially confidential information,” and is similar to the trade secrets issues that are being challenged in the United States; however, this ruling in the EU only applies to the data of the 2 companies.33", "Under US law, if a biosimilar attempts to enter and the innovator claims that its patent is infringed on, both the branded drug and the biosimilar may be required to reveal trade secrets.30 This may also lead to antitrust issues.", "If trade secrets must be divulged, the result may be that pharmaceutical companies are less willing to spend R&D on life-saving innovative biologics.30", "Roche decided to stay out of biosimilars and to focus on improved versions of patented medicines. Herceptin's patent expires in the EU in 2014 and in the United States in 2019.14", "The company developed 2 new drugs, Perjeta (pertuzumab) and Kadcyla (adotrastuzumab emtansine), to replace Herceptin.", "The typical course of Perjeta costs $188,000.18 And its new drug has recently shown good results—obinituzumab (GA101), which significantly decreased the risk of disease progression or death from chronic lymphocytic leukemia.34 This could be the next-generation biosimilar for Rituxan; the FDA has designated it a breakthrough therapy and has given obinituzumab a priority review.", "This drug could be on the market before biosimilar competition for Rituxan arrives in a few years.34", "Furthermore, some branded drug companies have responded in the market by lowering prices and creating second-generation biologics that are an improvement over the original agent and give the companies new patent and exclusivity rights.", "Branded biologics with annual sales of $1 billion to $2 billion and that are profitable will fight competition.", "For example, the price of Aranesp was cut when biosimilars entered the EU market.35", "The availability of a superior second-generation biosimilar could significantly decrease the demand for an inferior first-generation biosimilar.14 Also, the pricing of a second-generation biosimilar near that of a first-generation biosimilar could help the branded drug to control the market.14 For example, Neulasta, a second-generation of Neupogen (filgrastim), has a single treatment cycle cost of $3400 compared with Neupogen's cost of $6000.36 This is an approximate 40% cost reduction.", "Biosimilars could not compete with such a second generation if the biosimilar is priced only 30% less.", "Uncertainty over the impending regulatory framework and defense strategies by branded drugs has caused delays and has prompted some companies to halt drug development.37 Lonza is reviewing whether it is still worth investing in its biosimilar joint venture with Teva.37 It suspended its late-stage trial for MabThera in October 2012.", "Lonza's chief executive Richard Ridinger stated, “I would like absolute clarity before we make a large investment.", "The quality of decisions is more important than speed. ”37 He also states that the biosimilar development cost would exceed the $105.6 million that was estimated in 2009.37", "Similarly, Merck, Teva, and Samsung have encountered severe setbacks and have suspended some biosimilar projects.38 Jeff George, a division head of generics at Sandoz, states, “There are emerging signs of a shakeout in biosimilars and only the strong will survive.”", "Richard Murray, PhD, vice president of Merck's biologics and vaccines unit added, “There has been a little bit of volatility.”38", "Such a shakeout is common in the early days of an industry, but it indicates the risk involved.", "Celltrion may be third in the race to develop a biosimilar for Rituxan.39 It will finish a phase 1 trial before it revives its phase 3 trial, which it has altered after discussion with regulators.40 Sandoz and Boehringer Ingelheim are already conducting phase 3 trials for biosimilars of Rituxan.", "Rituxan loses patent protection in the EU in 2013. Samsung and Teva have suspended their phase 3 trial.40 Given the high cost of phase 3 clinical trials of biosimilars and the uncertain regulatory environment, the risk is so high that some companies are reluctant to proceed.", "In 2013, Celltrion was seeking a major pharmaceutical company to buy a controlling interest from its chief executive officer, indicating that it may be having financial difficulties.40 It recently received approval by the EMA for a Remicade biosimilar.", "Celltrion is aiming for approval of a biosimilar for Herceptin in Korea and in the EU. Its phase 3 trial is completed, but it has not filed for approval yet in the EU.40", "Sandoz has 7 ongoing phase 3 studies across 5 biosimilar molecules.12 Teva's Tevagrastim, a biosimilar for Neupogen, will be marketed in November 2013 as a biologic in the United States under an agreement with Amgen.39 While defending its 12 biologics, Amgen is also entering the biosimilar industry with 6 biosimilars of its competitors.41 Hospira “doesn't expect biosimilars to become key to its financial forecasts for at least 5 years.”35", "Humira (adalimumab) has more than 200 patents, and AbbVie will defend them all.38 “You have scientific complexity but also patent attorneys that influence market.”16", "Merck gave up its biosimilar project on Enbrel when Amgen got its expanded patent life.38 Dr Murray of Merck stated that “its portfolio is shifting away from the copies.”16", "Merck dissolved a dedicated biosimilar unit; however, it started over by forming a partnership with Samsung.", "Also, if Abbott prevails in the trade secret issue, the biosimilar market will not open in the United States until 2022.", "Companies may turn to the BLA instead of following the aBLA route.", "In the United States, even though the FDA has the legal right to approve biosimilars, there are presently no approved guidelines established for an aBLA approval.", "Some companies may enter through the BLA route. Teva and its partner Lonza received FDA approval in 2012 for a BLA for tbo-filgrastim, which competes with Neupogen.42 The same drug is a biosimilar in the EU under the name of Tevagrastim.", "Once the FDA opens the aBLA route, the choice will not be obvious, because there are advantages and disadvantages to each route.", "A new biologic approved under the BLA would never get interchangeability, but it can be marketed as a competing brand, or even as a biobetter, which would get exclusivity and maybe even patent rights.", "Furthermore, “the difference in the amount of data the FDA requires under the 2 routes may be very small.”43", "Even with the larger sample required for the BLA, the cost may be lower as a result of the company using only its product and not that of its competitors (which could be very costly).", "Unless the patent has expired, patent infringement issues are still valid; however, the company does not need to disclose proprietary data.34", "The advantage of using the biosimilar route (ie, aBLA) allows the company to extrapolate and “piggyback” on the branded reference product, which will also get approval for all the indications for which the reference product is approved.", "The BLA can only be marketed for the indication for which the new biologic is approved. Therefore, if a product has only 1 indication, it may be better to use the BLA.", "However, with many indications, the better strategy may be a biosimilar. In addition, under the biosimilar route, the drug may eventually be able to be interchangeable and be substituted for the reference product, without having to perform comprehensive clinical trials.", "The characteristics of biosimilars, along with the competitive aspects of the pharmaceutical industry, suggest that large, well-established companies will dominate the market.", "It is likely that alliances will continue to be prevalent to share the risk and uncertainty of biologic and biosimilar development.", "However, some companies have been successful by themselves.", "The best strategy for a biosimilar entrant may be to enter emerging markets, which have lower entry barriers, to develop strong postmarketing data to show that the product is truly a biosimilar, and then to enter more stringently regulated areas with an established record.", "“Early market entry, state funding, and low costs make biosimilars an attractive opportunity in emerging markets and a rise of such products has been seen in these markets.”19", "An added advantage is the less intellectual property protection, lower periods of exclusivity, and lower development and manufacturing costs in these markets, which could lead to 50% price reductions.19 For example, Dr Reddy's strategy involves “Launching products in emerging markets 4 to 5 years ahead of the United States,”22 which will allow it to gather data in India before entering the US market.", "Such economies associated with learning by doing will permit it to be a more effective competitor in developed markets.", "The possibility of using plants to produce biologics could reduce prices substantially, leading to greater acceptance of biosimilars.", "The complexity of biosimilars requires substantial expertise for survival; it also explains why there are so many alliances.", "Smaller companies that may develop a biosimilar will probably need an established firm to sell it in developed markets.", "Brand names along with established companies may be necessary to overcome physician resistance. Automatic substitution may arise after some considerable time, as experience is gained with biosimilars, but because many biologics are administered by physicians, this issue may be less important than with small-molecule generics.", "The business of biosimilars has not developed as quickly as expected. Despite all the current difficulties, it is expected that the market will develop, given the potential profits with patent expiration.", "Moreover, the mandate to decrease healthcare costs and to increase access to these life-saving pharmaceuticals will increase the biosimilar market.", "Appropriate public policy should encourage biosimilars but should also ensure that they are safe. The experience in the EU shows that biosimilars have been proved safe.", "Once the US market is open for biosimilars, regulatory and antitrust authorities should ensure that competition from biosimilars is allowed to develop, but also ensure that pioneer drug firms have sufficient incentives to develop new biologics.", "The 12-year market exclusivity is probably adequate.

This article examines the current landscape of the biosimilar market, characterizes tactics employed by biologics manufacturers to delay market entry and deter prescribing of biosimilars, and assesses ethical issues related to increasing the adoption of biosimilars.", "Biologic drugs, which include therapeutic proteins and monoclonal antibodies, are large complex molecules typically manufactured in genetically engineered organisms, such as modified bacteria.1 Biologics can be remarkably effective in treating a variety of illnesses, ranging from autoimmune diseases to cancer, but their high prices—often in excess of $100 000 per patient per year—have driven persistent growth in prescription drug spending.1", "In the United States, biologics account for 38% to 40% of all pharmaceutical spending,2,3 but fewer than 2% of Americans use them.2 From 2010 to 2015, biologics represented 70% of the growth in US drug spending.2,3", "One proposed solution to address the high cost of biologics was to facilitate the introduction of competitor products (called biosimilars) that are nearly identical to older, off-patent biologics via an abbreviated approval pathway.", "A similar pathway for generic small-molecule drugs had been created by the 1984 Hatch-Waxman Act4 and proved successful.", "Generic drugs now account for about 90% of all dispensed prescriptions in the United States and have saved the health care system roughly 1 trillion dollars between 2002 and 2011.5,6 Accordingly, in 2010, Congress passed the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act (BPCIA), modeled loosely on the Hatch-Waxman Act, as part of the Affordable Care Act, thereby establishing an abbreviated pathway for biosimilars to gain approval by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA).7 In this article, we characterize key clinical, economic, and ethical issues related to the approval and use of biosimilars.", "Under the BPCIA, the FDA might approve a biosimilar upon a manufacturer’s showing that it is “highly similar” to the reference biologic and has no “clinically meaningful differences” with respect to its safety, purity, and potency,7 eliminating the need for the biosimilar manufacturer to conduct a full set of pre-approval clinical trials, which were required for the originator drug.", "Additionally, the BPCIA specifies that a biosimilar can be judged interchangeable with the reference product if the biosimilar manufacturer can show that the biosimilar produces the “same clinical result” as the reference product in “any given patient” and can be switched with the reference product with no additional risks in terms of safety or diminished efficacy.7 Meeting this higher threshold requires submission of additional data, including results from trials in which patients are switched from the reference biologic to the biosimilar.", "In most states, obtaining this status would allow pharmacists to substitute a biosimilar for the reference biologic without intervention from the prescribing clinician.4,5,7", "As several blockbuster biologics have come off patent over the past few years and more are scheduled to do so in the early 2020s, biosimilars are poised to play a crucial role in curbing health care costs.", "According to some estimates, biosimilars could reduce health care spending by $54 billion between 2017 and 2026.3,8,9", "As of February 2019, the FDA had approved 17 biosimilars relating to 9 originator biologics (see Table).10 These numbers might seem to reflect positively on the BPCIA.", "However, the US biosimilar market has failed to develop to date in 2 important ways. First, not all FDA-approved biosimilars have been marketed.", "Only 7 of the 17 biosimilars, covering 4 originator biologics, were commercially available to US patients; 9 biosimilars had yet to be commercialized (and the other one is unlikely to launch for business reasons11) (see Table).", "Second, among biosimilars that have entered the market, price reductions and market penetration have been limited.", "For example, filgrastim-sndz, the first biosimilar to be approved under the BPCIA, entered the market in September 2015 at only a 15% discount off the originator’s list price.12 By the end of 2016, 5 quarters after its launch, filgrastim-sndz had acquired just 15% to 20% of the US filgrastim market.12", "Similarly, infliximab-dyyb, a biosimilar of infliximab, launched in November 2016 at a 15% discounted price relative to a brand-name biologic,13 and it has thus far acquired less than 5% of the US infliximab market.14 Given their low utilization, biosimilars have not yet achieved policymakers’ intended goal of increasing competition and reducing prices.", "| Originator Name | Biosimilar Name | Month/Year of Biosimilar Approval15 | Biosimilar on Market? | Litigation Status |", "| Adalimumab | Adalimumab-atto | Sept 2016 | No | Settlement; DE16 |", "| Adalimumab-adaz | Oct 2018 | No | Settlement; DE16 | |", "| Bevacizumab | Bevacizumab-awwb | Sept 2017 | No | Ongoing18 |", "| Epoetin alfa | Epoetin alfa-epbx | May 2018 | Yes, Nov 201819 | |", "| Etanercept | Etanercept-szzs | Aug 2016 | No | Ongoing20 |", "| Filgrastim | Filgrastim-sndz | Mar 2015 | Yes, Sept 201521 | |", "| Filgrastim-aafi | July 2018 | Yes, Oct 201822 | ||", "| Infliximab | Infliximab-dyyb | Apr 2016 | Yes, Nov 201623 | |", "| Infliximab-abda | Apr 2017 | Yes, July 201724 | ||", "| Pegfilgrastim | Pegfilgrastim-jmdb | Jun 2018 | Yes, July 201825 | |", "| Pegfilgrastim-cbqv | Nov 2018 | Yes, Jan 201926 | ||", "| Rituximab | Rituximab-abbs | Nov 2018 | No | Settlement; DE27 |", "| Trastuzumab | Trastuzumab-dkst | Dec 2017 | No | Settlement; DE28 |", "| Trastuzumab-pkrb | Dec 2018 | No | Settlement; DE29 | |", "| Trastuzumab-dttb | Jan 2019 | No | Ongoing30 | |", "aPfizer announced that it will not market infliximab-qbtx given its existing commercialization of infliximab-dyyb.11", "Which factors account for the lack of commercialization and low uptake of recently approved biosimilars?", "Manufacturers of the originator biologic products have employed several tactics to delay market entry of already approved biosimilars and impede patient utilization even after a biosimilar successfully launches.", "The primary reasons for delayed market entry include ongoing patent litigation or agreements to defer entry as a result of settling a patent dispute.31 For example, Sandoz and Mylan/Biocon reached global settlements with AbbVie and Genentech, respectively, regarding claims that the biosimilars adalimumab-adaz and trastuzumab-dkst infringed on patents protecting the originator biologics adalimumab and trastuzumab.28,32 Arguably, the most notable case of patent litigation leading to the delayed entry of biosimilars involves adalimumab, the top-selling drug in the world.", "In 2017, adalimumab had $18.4 billion in global sales, more than double the second best-selling drug, lenalidomide.33 AbbVie, adalimumab’s manufacturer, procured over 100 patents on the product.", "Although AbbVie’s active ingredient patent on adalimumab expired in 2016, it was granted a series of patents protecting everything from the manufacturing process to new formulations of the drug.16 One 2018 report found that 89% of these patent applications were filed after adalimumab was on the market, and 49% were filed after the first patent expired in 2014.34 This strategy of creating a wall of patents to protect assets34, 35 is known as developing a “patent thicket.", "AbbVie sued the manufacturers of adalimumab biosimilars, including Amgen, Boehringer Ingelheim, Mylan, Pfizer, Samsung Bioepis, and Sandoz, for patent infringement, with settlements having been reached in all but one case.16 These settlements entail a licensing deal in which the biosimilar manufacturers delay entry and pay AbbVie a royalty after they do reach the market.36 As a consequence of these settlements, the first biosimilars for adalimumab are anticipated to enter the US market in January 2023.36,37 Annual sales of adalimumab over the remaining years are anticipated to be over $10 billion, which will add to the cost burdens currently facing payers and patients in the United States.38,39,40", "Utilization of the few biosimilars that have entered the US market, meanwhile, has been suboptimal. One strategy originator manufacturers have employed to limit biosimilar uptake has been to negotiate formulary exclusivity with payers.", "In a 2017 lawsuit, for example, a biosimilar infliximab manufacturer alleged that the originator manufacturer entered into contracts with commercial payers to exclude biosimilars from drug formularies or include “fail first” provisions, which would require a patient to have failed on the original product before a biosimilar could be reimbursed.41", "Rebate schemes have featured prominently in this practice. The infliximab lawsuit charged that the originator manufacturer told insurers that if they did not grant exclusive use of its product, the manufacturer would withhold rebates on other products.41,42 At least 70% of commercially insured patients in the United States are affected by these exclusionary contracts.41 One study found that among 2547 Medicare Part D plans, only 10% covered the biosimilar infliximab compared to 96% that covered the originator.43", "With limited biosimilar availability in the United States, there remains substantial skepticism among prescribers and users relating to the efficacy and safety of biosimilars.", "A 2016 national survey of US physicians in specialties that have high utilization of biologics found that 55% did not believe that biosimilars were safe and appropriate for use in patients.44 Similar studies have found that patients have low levels of awareness of biosimilars as well as concerns about inadequate efficacy and elevated safety risks of biosimilars that are not consistent with reassuring evidence about their clinical usefulness.45 This skepticism has allegedly been promoted by some originator manufacturers.", "In August 2018, a citizen’s petition to the FDA charged that certain biologic manufacturers “mischaracterize important elements of the biosimilar criteria and create doubt and confusion about the safety and efficacy of biosimilars,”46,47 citing one Genentech webpage that explains that the “FDA requires a biosimilar to be highly similar, but not identical to the [reference product],” without stating that approved biosimilars have no clinically meaningful differences from the reference product.47 The petition also cited patient brochures emphasizing that the biosimilar infliximab was “not approved as interchangeable with” the originator version, which could mislead patients into thinking that biosimilars were unsafe.47", "Many solutions have been proposed to address the issue of limited utilization of biosimilars.5 For example, legislation could be passed to increase the transparency in reporting of biologic patents, which would allow biosimilar manufacturers to more readily challenge their validity.", "Additionally, regulatory agencies could scrutinize the anticompetitive practices of exclusionary contracts and enact stronger regulations against such practices.", "Lastly, the FDA could increase its efforts to educate physicians and the public about the bioequivalence of biosimilars and remove unnecessary naming policies that cause confusion among users, including the 4-letter suffixes given exclusively to biosimilars for the sole purpose of distinguishing them from their originators.", "Addressing these issues will inevitably result in increased biosimilar use. However, are there ethical concerns that arise with expanding the use of biosimilars?", "Some have argued that the BPCIA pathway does not sufficiently guarantee the effectiveness or safety of biosimilars, which is at the root of skepticism among patients and physicians.44,45 While it is possible that minor structural differences among biosimilars could lead to variable effectiveness and safety, studies to date have found no meaningful differences between a biosimilar and its respective originator biologic with respect to safety and efficacy.48-50 Still, postmarketing studies of biosimilars will continue to be necessary to evaluate these concerns.", "Perhaps the most important question facing policymakers is whether greater use of biosimilars will improve public health.", "The high cost of biologics remains a significant barrier to patient access and adherence.51 Although biosimilars will likely remain higher priced than small-molecule generics, price reductions will continue to manifest as more competition is introduced into the market.52,53,54 These lower prices will reduce overall health care costs and could improve patients’ medication adherence, resulting in better health outcomes.", "Although biosimilars have yet to yield the significant cost savings that they were touted to bring, pursuing greater biosimilar competition is a worthwhile goal.3 However, if a low-cost biosimilar market does not result from policies designed to eliminate barriers to entry and utilization, an ethical approach might be to mandate the reduction in the prices of originator biologic drugs after a certain time period on the market.55 Such a policy would achieve the goal of providing affordable and accessible therapeutics to patients, but there is likely not political appetite to implement it.", "Thus, encouraging increased competition in the biologics market with biosimilars remains the most promising mechanism to increase access to much-needed drugs.", "In July 2018, the FDA published its Biosimilars Action Plan, acknowledging the lack of competition in the biologics space.56 Recognizing the numerous barriers to the development and utilization of biosimilars, the FDA outlined 4 key goals in tackling this issue, including streamlining the approval process, improving regulatory clarity, increasing educational efforts to improve understanding among stakeholders, and collaborating with the Federal Trade Commission to address anticompetitive behaviors.53 Despite barriers to their commercialization and uptake, biosimilars remain a powerful tool with potential to lower health care costs and improve patients’ access to valuable therapeutics.", "- Ingrasciotta Y, Cutroneo PM, Marcianò I, Giezen T, Atzeni F, Trifirò G.

Drug patents last for 20 years after the filing date.", "Pharmaceutical companies have also employed tactics such as evergreening and thicketing to prolong a drug’s exclusivity.", "When evergreening,

lowering drug prices.", "One of Trump’s proposals from his so-called presidential blueprint52 included eliminating some rebates paid by drug companies53 that hide the true cost of drugs.", "However, the Congressional Budget Office estimated that the measure would actually increase federal spending on Medicare and Medicaid by $177 billion.54 The Trump administration also announced a regulation that would require TV ads for drugs to include the list price.55 Some experts believe this policy will be ineffective56 at making pharmaceutical companies lower list prices or end price hikes for drugs and will only confuse or mislead consumers rather than help them.57 These half-measures, combined with Trump surrounding himself with high-level Big Pharma officials, clearly communicates that the administration is not on track to lower drug costs for Americans.", "Congress has done little to address the problem of high drug prices. Instead, many members continue to enjoy cozy relationships with the pharmaceutical industry.", "The industry spent more than $62 million in the 2016 congressional elections—the most it has ever spent on political campaigns.58 The massive influx of campaign cash benefited members of both parties, including those that sit on committees with jurisdiction over drug pricing.59 Big Pharma’s investment has paid off as recently as July 2019, when the Senate Finance Committee failed to pass an amendment on the Prescription Drug Pricing Reduction Act of 2019, which would have allowed Medicare to negotiate drug prices with manufacturers.60 Medicare’s ability to negotiate on drug prices, which is currently prohibited by law, “would provide the leverage needed to lower drug costs.”61", "Despite his promise to be tough on Big Pharma, President Trump has proven to be a friend to the industry.", "Big Pharma officials have filled at least 1662 current or former positions in the Trump administration, and many of Trump’s top health advisers have been industry insiders or close to the pharmaceutical companies.", "Trump’s first secretary of health and human services, former Rep. Tom Price (R-GA), was a longtime friend of the industry63 in Congress, where he not only pushed Big Pharma’s agenda but also benefited from it financially.64 Price, who drew scrutiny for more than $300,000 in health care stock trades, was eventually forced to resign in 201765 as a result of his illicit use of private jets on the taxpayers’ dime.", "In 2017, Trump nominated Joe Grogan66 to a top position at the U.S. Office of Management and Budget.

In low income countries, we found a severe scarcity of innovation activities for treating Communicable Diseases (CDs) such as diarrhea, lower respiratory diseases, other common infectious diseases, and neglected tropical diseases and malaria which have the highest burden values in low income countries (Fig. 1(b)).", "Since most of the top 20 companies are located in the US or European countries, it is somewhat understandable that they may be more responsive to the disease burdens in these countries.", "However, in a world that is increasingly more globalized and closely connected, it may not be wise to focus R&D activities only on specific regions or countries.", "As in the cases of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS), Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), and Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), the outbreak of pandemics which began in developing countries can spread at any time to developed countries and pose a grave threat worldwide.", "In this regard, taking proactive innovation efforts that take into account diseases prevalent in underdeveloped countries can be beneficial not only to public health but also to corporations’ potential returns.", "In the case of COVID-19, hundreds of thousands of people are losing their lives due to the unprecedented worldwide pandemic.", "To date (as of June 21, 2020), Europe and North America accounted for 61.6% of total confirmed cases and 80.1% of total deaths in the world [30].", "Numerous pharmaceutical companies are making tremendous efforts to develop vaccines and treatments to combat COVID-19 and therefore 240 drugs are currently under development", "[24]. Since clinical trials on a single drug often proceed in several countries simultaneously, multiple counting by country was allowed, to investigate the drug development activities on COVID-19 by region.", "It was observed that drug development activities have been predominantly conducted in Europe (40.4%) and North America (29.5%) (Fig. 2).", "It is reasonable that R&D activities are biased toward these regions where developed countries are located, because the number of the confirmed cases and deaths due to COVID-19 are also predominantly high in these regions.", "On the other hand, it can be seen that the regions where low income countries are located such as Africa, Oceania, and South America are significantly marginalized in COVID-19 R&D activities.", "However, the progression and prognosis of the virus can be influenced by race/ethnicity (e.g. immunological differences), climate, sociodemographic factors (e.g. population density and poverty rate), etc., which vary from region to region [31,32,33,34,35,36].", "In addition, mutations of the virus, SARS-Cov-2, are continuously being reported as the spread of COVID-19 accelerates throughout the world [37, 38].", "In this regard, targeting only specific countries or demographics would not be the most effective way to develop more potent vaccines and therapies.", "Moreover, in countries where healthcare resources are limited, timely and large-scale diagnosis, treatment, control, and prevention are all huge challenges that cannot be established in the near future, leading to national catastrophes.", "From this perspective, there is a strong need to consider marginalized regions and people together in both private and public sectors.", "Several policy implications were derived from our study for both the private and public sectors. First, in the private sector, globally leading companies should further expand the development of drugs contributing to reducing the burden of marginalized diseases and/or countries, even if these types of drugs are less profitable.", "Of course, it should be acknowledged that the discrepancy between the innovation activities of the leading companies and DALYs is not particularly worse than the discrepancy found when we include the innovation activities of all other companies (Table S2 in Supplementary Information); furthermore, these leading companies should be given some credit for having contributed significantly to the development of orphan drugs.", "The top 20 companies accounted for 33% of the total innovation activities for orphan drugs during the period included in our analysis (Table 1).", "Over the past twelve years, multinational pharmaceutical companies’ investment in neglected tropical diseases (NTDs) has continuously grown, increasing fivefold since 2007, and they accounted for the vast majority (86%) of total industry sector investments in NTDs in 2018", "[39]. However, despite these remarkable efforts and contributions, they accounted for only 16% of all funding for NTDs R&D in 2018 [39].", "In other words, the investment in NTDs still depends heavily on the public sector. From this perspective, the leading companies which can better afford to manage their product portfolios taking into account both societal values and business returns, compared to small companies or startups where pursuit of profit is a top priority for survival, still have room for making meaningful progress in areas that have not fully benefited from support and investment for NTDs.", "Moreover, the public is increasingly demanding Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) from large pharmaceutical companies [23].", "It has been found that one of most preferred CSR activities by general public expected from pharmaceutical companies is the “promotion of public health” through activities such as the development of innovative drugs in untreated areas [40].", "Secondly, the roles and responsibilities of the public sector remain crucial. The voluntary participation of private companies alone cannot sufficiently alleviate the disease burdens around the world.", "It has already been demonstrated that pharmaceutical innovation is significantly affected by market size [41, 42].", "Our empirical analysis of several high income countries also proved that innovations are more closely related to market size than disease burden.", "In this context, it is natural that innovations are more concentrated in high income countries with large market sizes.", "Of course, diseases with high burden values are becoming more similar across both high and low income countries as non-communicable diseases (NCDs) have increased in low income countries in recent years [43].", "Therefore, the drugs already developed for such diseases in high income countries can be delivered to low income countries to reduce the disease burdens in those countries.", "In particular, global leading companies have made striking contributions to ensure that these drugs are more widely available, accessible, and affordable in these countries, by utilizing diverse strategies such as equitable pricing, licensing, and product donations [9].", "Their efforts and contributions should not be overlooked. However, even though the burden rankings of certain CDs such as HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, diarrhea, malaria, and neonatal disorders have already been lowered in high income countries, they still rank high in low income countries (Table S1 in Supplementary Information).", "In addition, while major CDs such as HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, and malaria are receiving high levels of R&D funding, other kinds of NTDs (WHO NTDs) have received very low levels of R&D funding, and what is worse, the funding levels have stagnated in place over the past decade [39].", "There are still unresolved areas that require careful attention and further actions. In this regard, international non-profit institutions and non-governmental organizations (NGO) need to more extensively strengthen support and investment for these marginalized diseases and countries by accurately identifying the areas where drug development by the private sector itself has been scarce.", "In addition, national governments should lead and foster basic research especially in areas where technological development is challenging due to the difficulties of mechanism identification or the lack of scientific knowledge.", "Such governmental initiatives should embrace a wide range of fundamental and original research conducted in various fields including academic, clinical, and industrial fields, which can contribute to population health in the long-term [44].", "Finally, public and private sectors should cooperate strategically by utilizing collaborative programs such as Product Development Partnerships (PDPs) to develop products that are societally valuable but provide uncertain potential return, such as the vaccine for Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS)", "[18, 45]. Specifically, the public sector should provide attractive incentives and benefits (e.g. assistance for clinical trials, ease of regulatory control, intellectual property protection, guaranteed profits, and so on) to the companies engaged in the programs.", "Since companies are fundamentally pursuing their own profit, it obviously to be expected that private firms will follow market forces.", "In this regard, the public sector can lead to increasing the market size of the disease areas where improvement is urgently required for the sake of public health.", "That is, governments can provide market incentives to induce the private sector to be more energetic in conducting innovation activities for diseases whose burden should be lowered more preferentially [46].", "This can be accomplished by implementing policy strategies such as allowing companies to increase their drugs prices, expanding the coverage of national healthcare insurance, and compensating for the development costs and ensuring the profitability of the drugs.", "Several relevant policies have been implemented in many countries, but it is necessary to strengthen these policies for diseases with the highest burden globally.", "The limitations of our study are as follows. First, when analyzing R&D activities by country, this study did not include cases where drugs that had already been developed elsewhere by leading pharmaceutical companies were delivered to marginalized countries through donation programs or free supplies, since we focused more on R&D activities than currently available drugs in a particular country.", "It should be recognized that billions of drugs and treatments are donated by the pharmaceutical industry partners.", "For instance, medicines for over 1.8 billion treatments were provided to impoverished and hardest-to-reach communities by donation programs in 2016 [47].", "If further studies that broaden the scope beyond this study were to incorporate other types of innovations such as product donations, building/strengthening healthcare systems, education/training of clinicians and scientists, improving awareness of diseases, etc.", "in addition to the R&D pipeline analysis, such studies can be expected to yield richer and broader implications from diverse viewpoints.", "Secondly, there were some data losses in the process of data transformation. The innovation activities aggregated based on AC were sequentially converted to data based on ICD, followed by GBD causes.", "In the process, since the AC code was linked only to the top ICD code, the one that was the most prescribed, other diseases for which the drug was also prescribed were excluded from our analysis.", "Thirdly, other variables besides disease burden and market size that can affect pharmaceutical innovation could not be fully covered in this study due to the difficulties of acquiring relevant data.", "For example, by considering market concentration and/or degree of competition as other explanatory variables [48], the effects of each variable on pharmaceutical innovation could be investigated in more detail.", "The recent innovation activities of leading global pharmaceutical companies were comprehensively investigated by comparing differences in innovation by income level, region, and country.", "This study identified that there have not been substantial improvements in the imbalances and discrimination of pharmaceutical innovations, even though many concerns on this issue have been raised by researchers, health professionals, and healthcare decision makers.", "Filling the gap remains a challenging task and requires the cooperation of diverse stakeholders.

a drug.", "After the FDA approves the product as safe and effective for a specified use, a company’s promotional activities must be limited to the intended uses that FDA approved.", "In fact, promotion by the manufacturer for other uses – known as “off-label uses” – renders the product “misbranded.”", "Paxil: In the criminal information, the government alleges that, from April 1998 to August 2003, GSK unlawfully promoted Paxil for treating depression in patients under age 18, even though the FDA has never approved it for pediatric use.", "The United States alleges that, among other things, GSK participated in preparing, publishing and distributing a misleading medical journal article that misreported that a clinical trial of Paxil demonstrated efficacy in the treatment of depression in patients under age 18, when the study failed to demonstrate efficacy.", "At the same time, the United States alleges, GSK did not make available data from two other studies in which Paxil also failed to demonstrate efficacy in treating depression in patients under 18.", "The United States further alleges that GSK sponsored dinner programs, lunch programs, spa programs and similar activities to promote the use of Paxil in children and adolescents.", "GSK paid a speaker to talk to an audience of doctors and paid for the meal or spa treatment for the doctors who attended.",

substance addictions and Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder, among other off-label uses.", "The United States contends that GSK paid millions of dollars to doctors to speak at and attend meetings, sometimes at lavish resorts, at which the off-label uses of Wellbutrin were routinely promoted and also used sales representatives, sham advisory boards, and supposedly independent Continuing Medical Education (CME) programs to promote Wllbutrin for these unapproved uses.", "GSK has agreed to plead guilty to misbranding Wellbutrin in that its labeling did not bear adequate directions for these off-label uses.", "For the Paxil and Wellbutrin misbranding offenses, GSK has agreed to pay a criminal fine and forfeiture of $757,387,200.", "Avandia: The United States alleges

for its approved indications and to spot drug safety trends.", "The missing information included data regarding certain post-marketing studies, as well as data regarding two studies undertaken in response to European regulators’ concerns about the cardiovascular safety of Avandia.", "Since 2007, the FDA has added two black box warnings to the Avandia label to alert physicians about the potential increased risk of (1) congestive heart failure, and (2) myocardial infarction (heart attack).", "GSK has agreed to plead guilty to failing to report data to the FDA and has agreed to pay a

resolve its civil liability for the following alleged conduct: (1) promoting the drugs Paxil, Wellbutrin, Advair, Lamictal and Zofran for off-label, non-covered uses and paying kickbacks to physicians

though it was not approvedor medically appropriate under these circumstances.", "GSK also promoted Advair for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease with misleading claims as to the relevant treatment

management.", "It further resolves allegations that GSK promoted certain forms of Zofran, approved only for post-operative nausea, for the treatment of morning sickness in pregnant women.", "It also

After all, the company marketed eight drugs with sales in excess of $1 billion in sales last year, in addition to alliance revenues of $1.6 billion, powered mainly by Celebrex.", "The most impressive aspect of Pfizer’s sales growth is that its top product, cholesterol drug Lipitor, increased sales by 24%, to nearly $8 billion in 2002.", "Pharma sales overall were up 12% in 2002, reaching $28.3 billion.

It is about accelerating the improvements we are already seeing in early R&D productivity and sustaining them for the years to come,” commented Tadataka Yamada, chairman, R&D.", "The facility houses uHTS robotic systems that will be capable of doing 300,000 experiments a day and managing the large amounts of information gathered.", "In addition, the facility houses the GSK compound library in an automated liquid compound store that can house as many as 2.8 million individual samples.", "Peter Goodfellow, senior vice president of discovery research, commented, “Automation on this vast scale frees our scientists from repetitive tasks and enables them to focus their attention on the best way to provide the CEDDs with leads of greater potency, selectivity and developability.", "“If we as a pharmaceutical industry don’t make new drugs, we don’t deserve to survive. We’ll have to reinvent the way we do R&D because it’s not working today,” said Mr. Goodfellow.", "“The drugs that are on the market today have taken up to 20 years to go from research to the medicines cabinet—we’d like to do that quicker.”", "What’s the R&D initiative led to? Some analysts believe GSK will have as many as 12 products (seven new, five line extensions) approved by the FDA in the next two years.", "The company finished 2002 with 123 projects in development, including 61 NCEs, 23 vaccines, and 39 line extensions.", "In addition to the CEDD program, GSK has worked to boost its pipeline by forming alliances and collaborations with a wide array of partners.", "The company signed two dozen major collaborations since 2001 (see the table on p. 46 for a partial list of alliances).", "In the immediate future, GSK has a number of new drugs pending.

One, which was ultimately named Hirulog, was an anticoagulant, meant to be given to heart patients to prevent blood clotting.", "The drug was meant to replace heparin, an older drug that is inexpensive and effective but has problematic side effects, including bleeding.", "Biogen's scientists believed Hirulog would be both safer and more effective.", "The other promising molecule was beta interferon, which Biogen had originally licensed to Schering Plough along with its better known relative, alpha interferon.", "Beta had sat on the shelf while alpha became a successful therapy for hep-atitis and various leukemias; the prevailing belief was that the two molecules were too similar to warrant developing both.", "Cetus had developed a slightly different form of beta interferon, but it had not shown much promise.", "But Biogen's lead scientists were convinced both that beta acted differently in the body than alpha and that their formulation of beta was superior to the Cetus molecule.", "\"Based on their view of the world, I went off to get beta back,\" Mr. Vincent said.", "At such points, the trajectory of Biogen, or that of any drug company, diverges from the path of other development-stage businesses.", "Drugs that show potential benefits in test tube or animal studies must all weather a sequence of human clinical trials designed to demonstrate safety and efficacy before they can be submitted for marketing approval by the United States Food and Drug Administration or equivalent foreign agencies.", "But while this costly and time-consuming regulatory process is unique to drugs, Biogen's management of it still has lessons for other companies.", "With Hirulog in clinical trials for multiple heart disease indications and beta interferon beginning trials against hepatitis B, the small company was strained.", "A smaller parallel trial of beta interferon against multiple sclerosis was financed by the National Institutes of Health, but it was considered a long shot by all concerned.", "It soon became clear that the company had to either add staff or contract out to manage the multiple trials.", "To maintain flexibility, Biogen chose to outsource trial management, using so-called contract research organizations, or C.R.O.'s.", "\"We get C.R.O.'s to do the brute-force stuff -- getting the data in, cleaning it up, cranking it out,\" said Irving Fox, Biogen's vice president for medical affairs.", "\"We work on data analysis, the creative part, in house. That way we don't have to hire armies of people.", "It isn't easy to outsource; you have to have in-house people who are talented to oversee it. But it gives you the leverage to compete in major markets, not just niches.\"", "But while going outside for help with the heavy lifting, Biogen's management also looked inside during this pivotal period.", "At many larger drug companies, the leading scientists have little to do with a molecule once it passes from discovery to the trial process and ultimately to market, as it ceases to be a matter of science and becomes an engineering problem and a marketing issue.", "\"Everybody has to be involved in moving the process along,\" said Dr. Phillip A. Sharp, a co-founder of Biogen and chairman of its scientific board as well as the head of the department of biology at M.I.T. \"It's true that drug development becomes an engineering problem, it becomes a marketing problem, but to the day our first drug was launched, a leading scientist in the company made calls to the regulatory agencies that were critical to the product's acceptance.", "In a small company, that integrated knowledge and expertise is critical.\"", "Drugs typically go through three phases of clinical trials before they are submitted to the F.D.A. The first phase, often on healthy volunteers, is to determine safety; the second, on a small number of patients, is to show efficacy; the third, on a large group of patients at multiple sites, is to confirm that the drug is safe and effective.", "Drugs can fail at any stage, and historically, about nine out of ten do. Nevertheless, optimism is the real dominant gene in the biotech firmament, and most managements believe their molecule will be the one in ten that succeeds.", "By the early 1990's, as Hirulog and beta interferon, now known as Avonex, proceeded through the various phases, the ground was littered with wounded biotech companies that had built vast manufacturing, marketing and sales infrastructures for drugs that ultimately failed.", "But at the same time, applying his maxim of adding management capacity in advance of growth, Mr. Vincent was already searching for an executive who could become his successor, someone with experience running a major operating company.", "He had met and been impressed by James R. Tobin, president and chief operating officer of Baxter International Inc., his direct competitor from his days at Abbott.", "But Mr. Tobin, who was widely considered a leading candidate to become Baxter's chief executive, turned down an offer to join Biogen.", "Months passed. \"It was one of the most arduous, intense and far-reaching searches I've ever done in my career,\" said Frederick Wackerle, a partner in McFeely, Wackerle, Shulman, a Chicago-based executive search firm that more typically works for Fortune 500 companies.", "\"We had three candidates from three industries, but Tobin remained our first choice.\" The next time Mr. Vincent called, Mr. Tobin accepted the position of president and chief operating officer, with the understanding that he would ultimately be chief executive.", "Mr. Tobin said that he had grown disenchanted with Baxter's strategic direction and that Biogen's $150 million a year in royalty revenues made the company a more attractive prospect than other biotech concerns that depend on repeated infusions of cash from equity offerings.", "The risk was lower, but the potential reward -- with two drugs in multiple clinical trials -- was comparable to other opportunities he considered.", "\"Biogen was right at the cusp of its curve,\" said Mr. Tobin, who joined the company in 1994. \"They said, 'We need to transition from research to operating company in three to four years.'", "Jim Vincent saw all of that and personally was planning to change his involvement and had enough foresight to understand the transition was real, it was different, it was hard; it was not a lay-down hand.\"", "While Biogen's royalty revenues mitigated its risk -- the company would not die if one or both of its lead drug candidates failed -- tough decisions lay ahead.", "As the data began to trickle in from the trials of Hirulog in heart disease patients and Avonex in hepatitis, it appeared that both worked well enough and were safe enough to gain F.D.A. approval.", "But the question still loomed, did they work enough better than alternatives -- heparin in heart disease and alpha interferon in hepatitis -- to succeed in the market?", "Complicating matters, the Chiron Corporation, which had acquired Cetus in 1991, completed clinical trials of its form of beta interferon, which it called Betaseron, in a form of multiple sclerosis called relapsing and remitting.", "Although the data were not particularly strong and the drug had a range of nasty side effects, the trials showed it reduced the number of flareups suffered by patients.", "Biogen's Avonex was still at an earlier stage in clinical trials.", "With no other effective therapies for M.S., the F.D.A. in 1993 approved Betaseron, which Cetus had licensed away to the Berlex Laboratories division of Schering A.G., a German company not related to Schering Plough.", "Berlex marketed the drug, paying Chiron a royalty and manufacturing fees. But because it had been considered such a long shot, neither Chiron nor Berlex was ready to manufacture Betaseron in large quantities, and for many months patients had to endure a lottery to determine who got the drug and who waited.", "That stumble, plus the multiple side effects of Betaseron, created an opening, and Biogen seized the opportunity.", "Biogen's scientists convinced Mr. Vincent and Mr. Tobin that Avonex, which more closely mimicked the natural beta interferon protein than Betaseron did, would both be more effective against multiple sclerosis and have fewer side effects than the Chiron-Berlex product.", "They designed a third clinical trial, intended to show that the drug actually slowed the progression of the disease rather than just reducing flareups.", "At the time, almost nobody outside Biogen and its academic collaborators believed this. The prevailing thought was that the two forms of beta interferon were essentially similar and at best Biogen might get F.D.A. approval only to fight a bruising marketing war with Berlex for half of a relatively small market.", "\"Wall Street doubted Avonex,\" said Jeffrey Casdin, an investment banker with Hambrecht & Quist, who has followed Biogen closely.", "But Biogen's management did count on it, sufficiently so that trials of Avonex in hepatitis were suspended.", "This decision was as much strategic as medical, Mr. Tobin said. Although Avonex appeared to be a better drug for hepatitis than alpha interferon, it was only modestly so.", "Moreover, hep-atitis is a huge market, primarily Asia-based, where Biogen would have to compete directly with its own far-larger marketing partner, Schering Plough.", "\"We chose a market where we were really adding value,\" Mr. Tobin said. \"We chose a bite-size target for our first time out.\"", "The total number of patients in the United States with relapsing and remitting multiple sclerosis is about 100,000, easily reached by the kind of small sales force Biogen could afford to mount.", "Hirulog was a drug aimed at a big market, the millions of heart disease patients who receive interventional therapy each year, and within Biogen, it was always considered the lead drug.", "So the company was devastated when, three months after Mr. Tobin's arrival, the clinical trial data on Hirulog showed it was somewhat safer than heparin, but no more effective.", "Hirulog could be an approvable drug, but probably not the billion-dollar drug Biogen had hoped for. It was time for another tough call.", "\"I said, 'Let's devote all of our resources to getting one thing right,' \" Mr. Tobin said. But the decision to kill Hirulog was not popular.", "The drug was the company's first real invention -- interferons had been discovered before Biogen was founded -- and half the company's 414 employees were devoted to the Hirulog program.", "\"Hirulog was the favored son; to put a bullet in that was emotionally the most difficult thing the company had faced,\" Mr. Tobin said.", "The decision was announced at a companywide meeting, and the Hirulog team moved to the Avonex program en masse.", "Although the company could have reduced costs by laying off some of these workers, it chose instead to retain everybody in the interest of maintaining morale and increasing the momentum of beta interferon.", "\"We made the decision right up front -- we are not going to lose a single person,\" Mr. Tobin said. \"We need everybody.\"", "Although Biogen could simply have put Hirulog on the back burner pending the outcome of the Avonex trials, Mr. Tobin and Mr. Vincent decided instead to license the drug to another company.", "\"It made more sense to make a clean decision that you could get everybody behind,\" he said. \"We had to manage expectations.\"", "Expectations were about to go through the roof. The data on Avonex were surprisingly strong: they showed that it did slow the progression of multiple sclerosis to disability and that side effects were substantially reduced compared with Betaseron.", "M.S. newsgroups on the Internet were soon buzzing with trial patients' anecdotal reports of the new drug's superiority, creating an upswelling of demand even before Biogen submitted its marketing application to the F.D.A.", "With the filing of its application, which occupied 32 feet of shelf space, Biogen entered a period of frenzied activity.", "Complicating matters, the German partner that had supplied beta interferon for the clinical trials declared bankruptcy, forcing Biogen to jump- start production in a pilot plant in Cambridge, at a cost of $10 million, and requiring another level of F.D.A. approval.", "Construction began on a volume production plant in Research Triangle Park, N.C., consuming another $60 million.", "Computer systems for inventory, order entry and billing had to be built [see article, page 59], costing about $20 million.", "Filing simultaneously with regulatory bodies in Europe added $30 million more to expenditures.", "And now the hiring of the long-deferred marketing and sales staff could be put off no longer. In the fall of 1995, Biogen hired a senior executive from Zeneca, the British pharmaceutical giant, and asked him to assemble a non-traditional team, emphasizing individuals with substantial medical backgrounds.", "\"They had to be the best,\" said Mr. Tobin. \"It isn't often salespeople get to introduce a product. It was as close to just-in-time as you could get.", "We hired management in November, December and January and started hiring reps in January. We could have launched March 15; as it was we launched in May.\"", "The delay was caused by a last-minute legal challenge from Berlex, which induced the F.D.A. to postpone approval.", "Because both companies held various patents covering beta interferon, Biogen had approached Berlex at one point about a cross license that would allow both products to coexist.", "Berlex rebuffed that overture and took the unusual step of suing the F.D.A., claiming that an approval of Avonex would violate the \"orphan drug\" status the agency had granted Betaseron.", "An orphan drug is granted a seven-year pledge of exclusivity by the F.D.A. in return for treating unmet medical needs.", "For a similar drug to be approved, it has to show superior efficacy or greater safety, or it must prove that it is actually significantly different from the orphan drug.", "Biogen went to work with the agency to defend Avonex, with the bonus that the F.D.A. then went on record in court saying Avonex was a superior drug.", "\"Getting this over with promptly was a corporate goal because Berlex was using this to go to doctors and say Avonex would never come to market,\" said Michael Astrue, Biogen's vice president and general counsel.", "\"So we went in there fast and forcefully.\" Although Berlex failed to block Avonex from the market, patent litigation continues between the two companies.", "With the regulatory path cleared, the priority became to ship Avonex as soon as possible after F.D.A. approval.", "\"We had competition, and we as a company had zero commercial credibility, so we wanted to make a statement,\" Mr. Tobin said.", "In contrast with the lottery that had been set up to distribute the limited supply of Betaseron when it came to market, Biogen was determined \"to be able to start shipping within 33 hours of approval, all the inventory you could want, and get it to you any way you wanted.\"", "He added, \"That made a very strong statement to a tight community that had been irritated by the Betaseron experience.\"", "Avonex was approved for sale in the United States on May 17, 1996, and the market battle with Berlex began in earnest.", "\"It took us seven months to catch them, and two-thirds of that was market growth,\" Mr. Tobin said. \"If all we had done was arm-wrestle Berlex for its 30,000 patients, we each would have wound up with 15,000.", "Now they have 20,000, we have 25,000 and everybody wins.\"", "The success of Avonex is an ongoing story, as Biogen must find ways to increase its penetration of the 100,000-patient market in the United States and to expand the drug's reach in other ways, possibly by treating other diseases.", "Approval by the pan-European regulatory agency came this April, opening another market comparable in size to the United States and presenting fresh challenges: no other biotech company has introduced a major drug in Europe without a local partner.", "And Biogen must produce more new drugs, whether through internal research or strategic alliances, to prove that Avonex was more than a one-time convergence of smarts and luck.", "\"Of course the question now is, What's the encore,\" Mr. Vincent said. \"Many companies have shown they can't do an encore.", "But nobody will ever convince me it's harder to do the encore than the original performance. I'll take this hand any day over the one we had in 1986.\"", "Where Biogen Went for HelpSmall companies with large competitors must ever seek leverage. As Biogen approached the introduction of its first drug, the company found some areas of expertise were too costly or time- consuming to build internally.", "Biogen turned to outside consultants for matters as diverse as strategic planning and systems implementation.", "And for one critical process, the company even tapped the expertise of large pharmaceutical companies.", "Biogen executives knew their first drug, Avonex, created to treat relapsing and remitting multiple sclerosis, would face competition right out of the gate, with the prospect of additional competitors in the near future.", "The Berlex Laboratories division of Schering A.G. was already marketing a similar drug for the disease, and at least three companies -- Pharmacia & Upjohn, Autoimmune and Teva Pharmaceuticals -- had potential M.S. drugs in the late stages of clinical trials.", "For help in planning a competitive strategy, Biogen turned to Joseph Nemec Jr., a senior vice president in Booz-Allen & Hamilton's New York office, who had been a consultant to the company since 1985, when he was brought in to conduct a complete strategic review for James L. Vincent, Biogen's chairman.", "Mr. Nemec devised a \"war game\" to explore the likely outcomes of different competitive scenarios. Biogen's senior executives were divided into teams devoted to each of the competing products, plus a neutral control group to act as umpires, briefed on each company's strengths and weaknesses, and turned loose to compete in a virtual market.", "\"The war game is a very powerful, albeit elaborate, tool,\" Mr. Nemec said. \"It allows a management team to put themselves in the shoes of their worst enemies, and everybody learns from that.", "It allows an understanding of market action and reaction in a very compressed time.'\"", "The primary issue examined in the war game process was pricing. Biogen executives believed they had a better drug than Berlex; should they charge more for Avonex?", "But Betaseron was already costly, at about $8,500 a year per patient. Should they charge less to grab market share, or would a lower price undercut the claim of superiority?", "\"We worked all night and did an assessment of how the market would accept each product,\" Mr. Nemec said.", "\"The key thing that made it work was that once you were on that team, you were as committed to Betaseron as Berlex was,\" said James Tobin, Biogen's president and chief executive.", "\"All of a sudden that product didn't seem so bad.\"'", "The war games persuaded Biogen to price Avonex the same as Betaseron. A higher price might have created roadblocks for patients trying to get reimbursement from Medicare and insurers unless Avonex's superiority could be proved, which would be a scientifically onerous task.", "And a lower price was unlikely to generate enough additional volume to offset the lower profit margins.", "Biogen executives say the war game proved a fairly accurate predictor of how Berlex would compete.", "The war game practice \"brings a live-bullet kind of attention and focus to the world you're going to face out there,\" said Mr. Vincent, Biogen's chairman.", "\"On a global basis we were going into a market with multiple competitors on the horizon. The action and reaction of competitors is where the process has the most value,'' he said.", "On a more pragmatic level, when Biogen executives realized they had an approvable drug, they also realized they had no systems in place to begin commercial operations.", "\"Had we wanted to take an order, we would have had to write it on a piece of paper,\" Mr. Tobin said. \"We had no inventory control system, no manufacturing system, no receivables, no customer interface.\"", "Yet those systems had to be up and running before the expected Food and Drug Administration approval of Avonex came through, so Biogen turned to the Computer Sciences Corporation, a consulting and systems integration company based in Newton Lower Falls, Mass.", "\"They put on a Biogen shirt, suited up and played,\" Mr. Tobin said. \"We started out without a contract, but at each level of detail of the project, they were right there.\"", "Computer Sciences had considerable experience working with large pharmaceutical companies, but discovered that a small biotech concern was something else.", "\"This is a small rapid-growth company, so we had to adapt the way we did things to fit its culture,\" said James Kenneally, a partner in Computer Sciences.", "\"That meant coming down off the methodology and all those things you should do to what you have to do given limited time and resources.\"", "Limited resources meant Biogen chose whenever possible to use off-the-shelf software, primarily from the Oracle Corporation, rather than build custom applications.", "One exception was \"Integrated Customer,'' a custom database combining commercial third-party data with Biogen's own sales figures.", "\"That was very important for them, to get a picture of how the market was responding,\" Mr. Kenneally said.", "One measure of the market's response took Biogen by surprise. After Avonex was introduced in the United States, large numbers of multiple sclerosis patients called the company directly, seeking advice.", "In most diseases, drug companies rarely have contact with patients. But Biogen executives say M.S. primarily strikes relatively young, affluent and educated white women, and the loss of control associated with the disease seemed to prompt many patients to seek greater understanding of the drug.", "\"M.S. patients call in droves,\" said Burt Adelson, Biogen's vice president for development operations.", "\"That has posed a unique challenge to this group for which you couldn't look back at the annals of pharmaceutical history.\"", "Nevertheless, Biogen turned to large established drug companies, which collectively have more experience dealing with patients, and found them willing to share advice.", "As a result the company hired pharmacists and nurses to field calls from patients and potential patients alike.", "\"Big pharma was very willing to share the information,\" Mr. Adelson said. \"It's the industry's image.", "Lawrence M.

Baer Professor Emeritus of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology.", "He led the team that, after 25 years of concentrated effort, purified the sheep form of erythropoietin, then the human variety.", "The discovery has enabled millions of dialysis patients and anemic patients with other diseases to live longer and more productive lives.", "“Gene Goldwasser was such a nice, quiet, unassuming guy, you would never know that he had done something so absolutely monumental,” said colleague Donald Steiner, the A.N. Pritzker Distinguished Service Professor of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology.", "“His work with erythropoietin has had enormous impact. It is one of the great contributions to science or medicine of the 20th century, comparable to the discovery of insulin.”", "A prolific researcher and author, Goldwasser published more than 150 research studies and 60 book chapters—almost all of them about some aspect of erythropoietin, also known as “epo.”", "He authored two short books: a biography of his mentor, Leon Jacobson, and a recently completed history of the quest for erythropoietin, which should come out in 2011.", "“He was someone who took enormous delight in doing science,” said Gary Toback, professor of medicine.", "“He was also a valued mentor, colleague and friend.”", "Although unsuccessful in persuading UChicago to patent his discovery—a novel concept at the time—Goldwasser worked as a consultant for the start–up biotechnology company, Amgen, sharing his expertise, methods and some of his purified erythropoietin to help them discover and clone the erythropoietin gene.", "Amgen patented the production of recombinant erythropoietin in 1987 and secured FDA approval of the drug in 1989 for treatment of anemia in patients undergoing dialysis.", "Although patent squabbles persisted for two more decades, the market for erythropoietin quickly blossomed to several billion dollars a year.", "“One percent of one percent of the drug’s annual revenues,” Goldwasser wistfully noted years later, “would have funded my lab quite handsomely.”", "It was a request from Jacobson, who ran the University’s Argonne Cancer Research Hospital after World War II, which triggered Goldwasser’s interest in this hormone, which he initially considered “just a laboratory curiosity.”", "Jacobson wanted to understand how the blood–forming process recovered after radiation exposure. So in 1955 he asked Goldwasser to isolate and purify the biochemical signal that regulated the growth of new red blood cells.", "“I thought it would be a short diversion for about six months, and then I’d get back to other research,” Goldwasser recalled.", "In 1957, by removing various organs from rats and looking for the onset of anemia, he had traced production of the signal to the kidneys, which explained why patients with chronic kidney disease were often anemic and suggested that erythropoietin could be found in urine.", "By 1971 his lab had purified 6 millionths of an ounce of the hormone from 125 gallons of plasma from anemic sheep.", "Erythropoietin, he noted in a press statement at the time, “is present, even in enriched sources, in an extremely minute amount.”", "The breakthrough came in 1973, when Takaji Miyake, a Japanese physician who cared for patients suffering from aplastic anemia, contacted Goldwasser.", "They agreed to collaborate. While Goldwasser procured funding, Miyake collected 2,550 liters of urine from his patients.", "On Christmas Day 1975, he arrived in Chicago with his concentrated samples. Within 18 months they had eight precious milligrams of the potent human hormone.", "“We put it in rats,” recalled Goldwasser, “and it worked like a charm.”", "Most of the existing supply went to a small, unpublished clinical trial, development of an assay to measure hormone levels in the blood, and early attempts to determine the amino–acid composition, a first step toward cloning the gene.", "In 1977, at the urging of colleagues and the federal agencies that funded his lab—the Department of Energy and the National Institutes of Health—Goldwasser filled out the patent disclosure form and submitted it to the University.", "“After submitting the form, I promptly forgot about it,” he wrote years later, “since nothing was ever done about filing for a patent.", "I believe the rules at the time would have allowed me to file a patent for myself if the agency or the University decided not to—another point to perhaps be rueful about.”", "Filing for patents “was not generally done at the time,” noted Toback.", "Fledgling biotech companies, however, recognized the potential of Goldwasser’s discoveries. Several, including Biogen and Applied Molecular Genetics (now Amgen) sought his guidance.", "“Biogen asked Gene to join their board of epo advisors,” recalled Chicago colleague, Robert Haselkorn, professor of biochemistry and molecular genetics.", "“Gene looked at the list of others on the board and decided that they were mediocre. Then, Amgen went through the same exercise and asked Gene to be their sole advisor on epo.", "He accepted, declining the board role but signing on as a consultant.” In 1985, a team from Amgen cloned the gene using two probes derived from amino acid sequence analysis of Goldwasser’s purified human erythropoietin samples.", "By 1986, industrial production was under way. The first reports from clinical studies appeared in late 1986 and 1987, confirming that the drug could correct anemia in patients with kidney failure.", "By 1996, annual sales in the United States exceeded $1 billion. Amgen subsequently funded a professorship in Goldwasser’s department.", "“The enormous success of epo still astonishes me,” Goldwasser wrote in a 1996 biographical essay. “It is still gratifying to me to see how effective epo is in correcting the anemia of dialysis patients, and how it spares them repeated transfusions.”", "Less gratifying was the subsequent recognition, in the late 1990s, that athletes had been injecting the drug to boost their red blood cell counts for a competitive advantage.", "In 1998, an epo–based doping scandal resulted in expulsion or withdrawal for one–third of the 21 teams in the Tour de France, a development that deeply dismayed Goldwasser.", "The benefits of his discovery however, far outweighed its potential for abuse. “Recombinant human erythropoietin is arguably the most successful therapeutic application of recombinant DNA technology to date,” said a 2009 editorial in the New England Journal of Medicine.", "“Since the initial reports … documented a cure of the anemia of chronic kidney disease with recombinant human erythropoietin, well over a million patients have been treated with it effectively and with minimal drug–related toxicity.”", "Born Oct. 14, 1922, Goldwasser spent his first decade in Brooklyn, N.Y, before the Depression forced his father to close his small clothing manufacturing business and move to Kansas City, where his brother ran a similar business.", "In high school, Goldwasser developed an interest in science. He won a scholarship to the University of Chicago, where he majored in biological sciences and, after the attack on Pearl Harbor, worked as a research assistant in the University’s Toxicity Laboratory, a federally funded program to assess chemical and biological risks.", "He completed his bachelor’s degree in biochemistry in March 1943.", "He was drafted into the United States Army in 1944 and served for two years as a biochemist at Fort Detrick, Md., working on anthrax.", "In 1946, he returned to UChicago as a graduate student. He married Florence Cohen of Chicago in 1949 and completed his PhD in biochemistry in 1950.", "He spent the next two years in a post–doctoral fellowship studying nucleic acids (part of it alongside fellow post–doc James Watson, a future Nobel laureate) with Herman Kalckar at the Institute for Cytophysiology in Copenhagen, Denmark.", "In 1952, Goldwasser returned to Chicago as an instructor in biochemistry. He stayed for the rest of his career, rising to professor of biochemistry and molecular biology in 1963 and chair of the department from 1984 to 1985.", "He retired at age 65 in 1987, but remained active in his laboratory and served again as department chair from 1994 to 1998.", "He also served as chair of the Committee on Developmental Biology from 1976 to 1991.

In fact, applying a short-term perspective to exploration makes almost all new ideas look bad.", "The success trap, conversely, is associated with too much exploitation. That is the case when a company is satisfied by the returns on exploiting present knowledge and technologies.", "Its current success will tempt the company to continue exploiting, at the expense of exploration—although exploration is necessary in the long term.", "We found that fully one-third of companies fall into the success trap during a five-year period and that only one in five manages to escape.", "These companies are pictured in the lower-left quadrant of Exhibit 2.", "In the long run, the best performers are companies that are able to do both: to foster efficiency and to explore future growth options.", "Maintaining an “Outside In” Focus Even When Successful", "Disruption usually comes from the outside, and being too inward-looking puts companies at risk of missing key customer or market trends.", "The 2% companies don’t just excel at both exploration and exploitation activities, they also manage to keep an external (outside-in) focus even when they are successful.", "This is not as easy as it seems; successful companies very often become introverted. History is paved with examples of companies that reached the top of their industry but failed to remain there.", "Recall Motorola, Blockbuster, Dell, Nokia, and Kodak.", "Some current industry leaders, flush with current success, might be overlooking emerging threats.

Successful companies have a tendency to gradually become inward facing because organizational complexity has increased.", "When successful companies grow, so do the breadth and depth of business requirements. As a response, companies tend to create dedicated structures, processes, systems, and metrics that increase the complicatedness of the organization.", "Significant resources and attention must then be devoted to internal management. (See “How Complicated Is Your Company?,” BCG article, January 2018.)", "Success can also make companies look inward because, by generating too much free cash flow for allocation, success can exacerbate an agency problem: managers might push to keep as many resources as possible under their control and thus invest all extra cash in projects in-house, while, in contrast, board members might want to maximize the payoff for shareholders and thus avoid investing in projects that gradually become, according to the law of diminishing returns, less attractive.", "Maintaining an outside-in drive starts by continuously scanning the market, both demand and supply. On the demand side, successful companies must see themselves through the eyes of the customer and constantly look out for early signs of potential megatrends.", "On the supply side, companies must be willing and able to engage in partnerships and collaborations.", "For example, in 2011, Umicore, a Belgian metals and mining company, wanted to expand its recycling activities in order to recover rare earth elements from rechargeable batteries.", "The company possessed a state-of-the-art battery-recycling process—the Ultra High Temperature (UHT) process—but lacked the capabilities to refine rare earths.", "It thus partnered with Rhodia, a French chemical company. Together, the two companies developed the first industrial process that closed the loop on the rare earths contained in batteries.", "Breakthrough innovation is rarely performed by one single actor end-to-end, and participation in relevant partnerships, platforms, or ecosystems can be key.", "When disruptive shocks hit, they must be fully embraced. Doing so first requires companies to recognize risks.", "Strategic decision making in the context of risk can be subject to multiple cognitive biases. One example is loss aversion, in which the thought of losing something one has is more abhorrent than not taking advantage of a new opportunity for gain.", "Therefore, there is a tendency to overvalue current business models compared with new, disruptive models and their opportunities.", "To sidestep that problem, companies must be brutally honest and recognize that market conditions won’t remain the same forever.", "They never do. Profitable businesses inevitably attract potential entrants with innovative business models.", "In practice, fully embracing disruption means that at times companies must respond by being disruptive themselves rather than making small incremental fixes to their current model.", "Tobacco companies understood this when they invested—massively—in electronic cigarettes. Electronic cigarettes have been around for nearly 30 years but gained strong momentum only recently, pushed by small emerging players such as V2, Juul, and Mig Vapor.", "Large tobacco companies decided to embrace disruption by bringing to market their own solutions. Philip Morris International (PMI), for example, invested about $3 billion to develop its iQOS.", "The company has done so despite the high cannibalization risk to its current business.", "Another example involves the introduction of mobile technologies. When telecom companies faced the entrance of mobile technologies, they could have responded either by incrementally refining their old landline business or by using those innovative mobile technologies themselves to become part of the disruptive force.", "In the longer term, only the latter approach allowed companies to realize the full benefits of disruption.", "Overall, when disruption hits, major commitments have to be made, even if doing so is painful. These commitments can also mean deprioritizing profitable activities to focus resources—management attention, talent, or financial resources—on disruptive trends.", "Neste, a Finnish oil-refining company, invested heavily in renewable-diesel production, foreseeing regulatory changes in the EU that would create a market for diesel made from renewable sources.", "The 2% companies have an explicit model for managing the inevitable tradeoffs between near- and long-term priorities.", "The right model for the subsequent renewal also optimally leverages the capabilities of the company and fits the organizational culture.", "Needless to say, these models are company specific and there is no “one size fits all.” In our work with various industries and in ongoing discussions with executives, we’ve identified a set of models.", "We offer five recommendations for becoming a 2% company:", "1. Invite challenge and coaching from the outside. Welcome differing opinions. Be willing to be challenged by, and to learn from, others.", "No one can be right all the time, and welcoming outsiders so that you can benefit from their unbiased, outside-in perspectives will help you stay close to customers and nascent market trends.", "Having a clear picture of those trends will also prevent your company from setting out in a wrong direction and provides the confidence necessary to make difficult decisions.", "2. Think in multiple time frames. Ask yourself what you’re doing to best position yourself for next year, five years from now, and ten years from now.", "This mindset will enable both exploration and exploitation activities and strike the right balance of the two.", "Thinking in multiple time frames is also a critical first step toward defining the right renewal model for your company, as it ensures that your chosen strategy will deliver results at all relevant time frames.", "3. Get ahead of any crisis. Recognize risk and be brutally honest. Once risks and opportunities have been clearly identified, make sure you address disruption in the way that best positions your company and takes full advantage of the disruptive forces.", "Have the courage to act promptly and preemptively: establish an early-mover advantage that can be instrumental for sustainable success.", "4. Be skeptical of current success. One should never rest on one’s laurels. Successful companies must stay sober and modest so as to avoid creating a company culture that rests on complacency and self-satisfaction.", "Rather, keep a mindset of continuous quest for improvement and search for novel ideas. This will trickle down through the entire organization and ensure that key stakeholders always push the frontier of possibilities.", "5. Review your renewal strategies explicitly. Pursuing excellence on all four of the previously described traits can be exhausting for an organization.", "As a result, explicitly reviewing your company’s performance is necessary to ensure that all dimensions are tackled and that there are no gaps between intention and action.", "To this end, we have built a simple, pragmatic assessment tool that helps executives to rapidly weigh their strategies against the four traits.", "We call it the “2% cockpit” because it helps to show executives how to pilot their organizations the way that 2% companies do.", "The 2% companies set a high bar. But by emulating these performance leaders and heeding the recommendations set forth above, other companies can achieve and sustain a higher level of success than they currently enjoy.", "Ten years from now, we may find ourselves talking about new manifestations of exploration and exploitation and an expanded roster of companies that excel at both innovation and efficiency: the 3%—or more.", "The BCG Henderson Institute is Boston Consulting Group’s strategy think tank, dedicated to exploring and developing valuable new insights from business, technology, and science by embracing the powerful technology of ideas.", "The Institute engages leaders in provocative discussion and experimentation to expand the boundaries of business theory and practice and to translate innovative ideas from within and beyond business.", "For more ideas and inspiration from the Institute, please visit Featured Insights.", "Managing Director & Senior Partner, Chairman of the BCG Henderson Institute", "Boston Consulting Group partners with leaders in business and society to tackle their most important challenges and capture their greatest opportunities.", "BCG was the pioneer in business strategy when it was founded in 1963.

Shalala, held that, under the amended AKS, an individual must “know that [it] prohibits offering or paying remuneration” to violate the statute.7", "A number of other courts rejected Hanlester’s expansive reading of “knowing and willfully,” holding that the AKS did not require the government to prove a willful violation of a known legal duty, but rather only that the defendant’s conduct was voluntary.8 In United States v.

From early 2010 through 2011, its business increased at the rate of 5% a month, according to then Chief Executive Officer Latonya Mallory.19 After the settlement, HDL filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy and the bulk of its assets were purchased at auction by True Health Diagnostics in October 2015.20The FCA action persists against Mallory; HDL and Singulex’s marketing agent, BlueWave HealthCare Consultants; and BlueWave’s principles, Floyd Calhoun Dent and Robert Bradford Johnson, III.21", "In June 2016, OPKO Health, a.k.a. OurLab, and its president, James Oppenheimer, agreed to pay $9.35 million to resolve allegations that, from 2007 to 2015, they contributed to customer-physicians’ costs associated with their electronic health record (EHR) systems in exchange for patient referrals.22", "Among the key issues in the OPKO matter was the applicability of a safe harbor provision. From 2006 to 2013, the AKS contained a safe harbor that permitted a vendor to pay part of the purchase price of an EHR system on a health care provider’s behalf.", "But the vendor could not consider the volume of patient referrals in determining whether and how much to contribute to a given provider.", "According to the relator, OPKO and Oppenheimer based its contributions on patient referrals, thus forfeiting the protection of the safe harbor.", "Per the terms of the settlement, OPKO and Oppenheimer are excluded from participating in federal health care programs for five years.", "Kickback concerns arise when pharmaceutical companies provide anything of value to prescribers or pharmacies in an effort to increase their market share.", "With pharmacies, the “anything” at issue is typically a rebate. With prescribing health care providers, it can take various forms—from a lavish meal to a trip to a lucrative role with the company as an advisor, a speaker, or an author.", "In recent years, the government and rela-tors have scrutinized drug companies’ relationships with both pharmacies and physicians alike.", "In 2013, the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania unsealed a non-intervened FCA case in which the relators alleged that Allergan, Inc. violated the AKS by providing ophthalmologists with inducements, in exchange for prescribing Allergan eye care drugs.23", "The complaint alleged a litany of the usual types of remuneration, such as speaker and consultant fees for high-prescribing doctors.24 But, quite uniquely, it also asserted that Allergan provided well-heeled business consultants to help its physician clients maximize their revenues.", "The case came in the wake of Allergan’s September 2010 entry of a guilty plea and payment of a $600 million settlement to resolve allegations that it had engaged in the off-label marketing of Botox.25", "2013 also saw two FCA settlements involving large pharmaceutical companies that allegedly paid rebates to induce pharmacies to steer Medicare and Medicaid patients towards their drugs and away from their competitors.", "Amgen, Inc. paid $24.9 million to release kickback claims related to the promotion of its bone marrow stimulant, Aranesp.26 Likewise, as part of a gargantuan $2.2 billion settlement with the federal government, Johnson & Johnson agreed to pay $149 million to dispose of allegations that it had offered rebates to induce Omnicare nursing home pharmacies to switch its patients from competitor drugs to the anti-psychotic, Risperdal.27", "Three years later, Omnicare signed its own FCA settlement agreement, which required it to fork over more than $28 million to resolve claims that it had accepted kickbacks from Abbott Laboratories in exchange for prescribing Depakote to elderly patients.28", "Omnicare’s settlement was the cherry on the top of the government’s civil and criminal prosecution of Abbott for (1) marketing Depakote off-label; (2) paying illegal remuneration to health care providers and pharmacies to induce them to prescribe or promote the drug; and (3) improperly influencing the content of company-sponsored Continuing Medical Education programs.29 That prosecution ended with Abbott agreeing to pay a $1.5 billion settlement.", "In November 2015, Novartis Pharmaceutical Corporation agreed to pay $390 million to settle an FCA suit alleging that it provided specialty pharmacies with rebates as inducements to increase the pharmacies’ prescriptions of Novartis drugs.30 Four months after the parties reached the settlement, the government moved to compel the discovery of additional records from Novartis regarding 80,000 events, which were supposed to educate physicians about Novartis products, but, according to the government, served as free wine-and-dines for health care professionals at high-end restaurants and sports bars.31", "Hospitals most commonly violate the AKS when they provide remuneration—either through cash payments or the disbursement of other benefits—to physicians or other entities for patient referrals.", "As government health care programs often pay for the services provided to those patients, the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) has become aggressive in its pursuit of both the payers and the recipients of the kickbacks.", "In United States v. Atlanta Medical Center, Inc.,33 two Georgia hospitals that are part of the Tenet Healthcare system—Atlanta Medical Center and North Fulton Medical Center—pleaded guilty to criminal violations of the AKS.", "According to the government, over the course of a decade, hospital executives paid more than $12 million to induce Hispanic Medical Management, Inc. to send pregnant immigrants (many of whom were undocumented) to the Tenet hospitals.", "Hispanic Medical Management did business in Georgia and South Carolina under the name Clinica de la Mama.", "Under the terms of the plea agreement, the hospitals will forfeit $145 million, the amount that they netted from Medicare and Georgia Medicaid “for services provided to patients referred as part of the scheme,” according to DOJ.34", "On the civil side, Tenet agreed to pay $368 million— $244 million to the United States and the remainder to the state of Georgia—to settle FCA allegations based on the same kickback scheme.35 All told, the federal government and Georgia are set to recover more than half a billion dollars from the Tenet entities.", "Finally, a patient-referral kickback scheme led to the conviction and imprisonment of ten individuals, including five physicians, in Illinois.36 The center of the scheme was Chicago’s now-shuttered Sacred Heart Hospital.", "According to the government, from 2000 to 2013, the hospital’s Chief Executive Officer, Edward Novak, and his colleagues paid physicians to refer their elderly patients for hospital services that would be compensated by Medicare and Medicaid.37 The kickbacks were disguised as sham lease payments, teaching contracts, and staffing perks, such as free labor from physicians’ assistants and nurse practitioners.", "On July 29, 2015, Novak was sentenced to 54 months’ imprisonment and ordered to forfeit $10.4 million.", "Other executives received shorter sentences of incarceration, which range between a year and a day and 21 months.38", "Somewhat unusual—though becoming more common—among kickback cases is the fact that the government targeted the kickback recipients, i.e., physicians, in the Sacred Heart case.", "Among the five doctors convicted of criminal charges and sentenced are podiatrist, Shanin Moshiri, and the professed “King of Nursing Homes,” Venkateswara Kuchipudi.", "Moshiri was sentenced to three months’ imprisonment and three months’ work release in January 2016 after being found guilty at a bench trial for receiving $200,000 in kickbacks.39 Kuchipudi, who was convicted by jury, was sentenced to 24 months’ imprisonment and ordered to pay $786,000 in fines and forfeiture in March 2016.40", "Comments from Moshiri and Kuchipudi’s counsel harken back to the Ninth Circuit’s no-longer-viable decision in Hanlester.", "After the jury found Kuchipudi guilty, his attorney expressed “disappoint[ment] in the verdict because Kuchipudi did not willfully violate the anti-kickback statute.", "”41 Then, after sentencing, Moshiri’s lawyer mused, “Had he appreciated what he was involved in, he wouldn’t have gotten involved.", "He just took the money.

interchangeable biological product).", "To balance competition and innovation, the BPCIA established two periods of exclusivity applicable to a brand-name biologic (i.e., the reference product)—one with a duration of 4 years and the other with a duration of 12 years.39 Periods of regulatory exclusivity attach upon approval or licensure of a drug or biologic, respectively, if certain statutory requirements are met, limiting the ability of competitors to reference the data generated by brand-name drug manufacturers.", "During the four-year exclusivity period, a BLA for a biosimilar or interchangeable product referencing the brand-name biologic may not be submitted to FDA.", "During the 12-year exclusivity period, approval of a BLA for a biosimilar or interchangeable product

reference product was first licensed, and a BLA for a biosimilar or interchangeable product cannot be submitted to FDA until four years after the date on which the reference product was licensed.", "Certain biologics are not eligible for the reference product exclusivity, for example, if an application is for a minor change to a previously licensed biologic.40 A new biologic may be eligible for an additional 6-month period of exclusivity that would attach to the 12- and 4-year periods if the applicant conducts pediatric studies pursuant to a written request from FDA.41", "Additionally, a biologic approved to treat a rare disease or condition may be granted seven years of orphan drug exclusivity for the protected indication, in which case FDA may not license another biologic for the protected orphan indication until after the expiration of the 7-year or 12-year exclusivity period, whichever is later.42 While the first biosimilar for a brand-name is not eligible for exclusivity, the first interchangeable product is.", "This means that FDA will not make an interchangeability determination for a subsequent biologic relying on the same reference product for any condition of use until such exclusivity expires.43 The periods of exclusivity available for biological products under the PHSA are generally longer than those for chemical drugs under the FFDCA (i.e., five-year new chemical entity exclusivity, three-year new clinical study exclusivity).", "Transitional biological products will not be eligible for the 12-year biologics exclusivity period because they were not first licensed under the PHSA, as specified by the BPCIA.", "In guidance, FDA states, \"[n]othing in the BPCI Act suggests that Congress intended for biological products approved under section 505 of

according to FDA guidance, any unexpired period of exclusivity associated with an approved NDA for a biologic subject to the transition would cease to have any effect.45 This would include the

This is in contrast to the proprietary name of a drug or biologic, which is the trademarked name, or brand name.", "It is the name a company uses to market its drug product, and it is usually capitalized, followed by a superscript R in a circle (®).", "For example, Neupogen® is the proprietary name for filgrastim, the nonproprietary name for the active substance.", "FDA released draft guidance on the nonproprietary naming of biological products in August 2015; this guidance was finalized on January 12, 2017.69 In March 2019, FDA issued a revised draft guidance.70 The agency intends to ultimately issue a revised, final version of the 2017 naming guidance incorporating comments on the 2019 draft guidance.71 According to the naming convention outlined in the January 2017 guidance, \"the nonproprietary name designated for each originator biological product [i.e., the reference product], related biological product, and biosimilar product will be a proper name that is a combination of the core name and a distinguishing suffix that is devoid of meaning and composed of four lowercase letters.", "\"72 The core name refers to the component shared among an originator biological product and any related biological, biosimilar, or interchangeable product as part of the proper name.73 An example of a core name is filgrastim.", "The suffix is attached to the core name with a hyphen as a unique identifier, for example, filgrastim-xzwy.", "This naming convention was to be applied to previously licensed and prospective biologics and biosimilars.", "In the March 2019 revised draft guidance, FDA stated that it no longer intends to modify the proper names of biologics that were previously licensed under the PHSA without an FDA-designated suffix in their proper names.", "The agency also does not intend to apply the naming convention to transition biologics (e.g., insulin).74 Instead, FDA will apply the naming convention to biological products at the time they are licensed.", "This is in contrast to the approach outlined in the agency's 2017 naming guidance, which would have applied this naming convention to previously licensed biologics, as well.", "For interchangeable products, in the revised guidance, FDA determined that a unique suffix that distinguishes an interchangeable product from other products sharing the same core name would be appropriate.75", "In general, the biosimilars industry seems to support the shared use of a nonproprietary name, whereas those advocating for the innovator companies prefer a naming scheme that distinguishes between the reference biologic product and the biosimilar.76 In its October 2015 public comments to FDA, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) expressed concern that the FDA's naming proposal assigning unique differentiating suffixes \"could result in physicians incorrectly believing that biosimilars' drug substances differ in clinically meaningful ways from their reference biologics' drug substances.", "\"77 This \"misperception\" could \"deter physicians from prescribing biosimilars\" thereby \"impeding the development of biosimilar markets and competition.", "\"78 FTC reiterated these concerns in its May 2019 public comments on FDA's March 2019 draft guidance, stating that \"[t]his unusual naming convention—applied exclusively to a subset of new entrants—likely would create consumer confusion and discourage use of newly introduced biosimilar and interchangeable products.", "Another factor that has been identified as potentially impacting uptake of launched biosimilars is FDA's policy on biosimilar labeling, specifically the recommendation for inclusion of a biosimilarity statement.", "The labeling for a prescription drug product conveys information about the product's safety and effectiveness to a health care provider, allowing the provider to decide if the product is appropriate for a particular patient.", "In 2006, FDA issued a final rule on the content and format of labeling for prescription drug products, including biological products.80 FDA requires that labeling begin with a highlights section that includes any warnings about the drug.", "Other FDA-required elements of labeling include indications and usage, dosage and administration, dosage forms and strengths, contraindications, warnings and precautions, adverse reactions, drug interactions, use in specific populations, drug abuse and dependence, overdosage, clinical pharmacology, nonclinical toxicology, clinical studies, references, how supplied/storage and handling, and patient counseling information.", "FDA released draft guidance on biosimilar labeling in March 2016 and final guidance in July 2018.81 FDA recommends that the highlights section of the labeling contain a \"Biosimilarity Statement\" describing the biosimilar product's relationship to its reference product.", "For example, \"NIVESTYM (filgrastim-aafi) is biosimilar* to NEUPOGEN (filgrastim),\" followed by the statement:", "* Biosimilar means that the biological product is approved based on data demonstrating that it is highly similar to an FDA-approved biological product, known as a reference product, and that there are no clinically meaningful differences between the biosimilar product and the reference product.", "Biosimilarity of [BIOSIMILAR PRODUCT'S PROPRIETARY NAME] has been demonstrated for the condition(s) of use (e.g., indication(s), dosing regimen(s)), strength(s), dosage form(s), and route(s) of administration described in its Full Prescribing Information.", "Some stakeholders have expressed opposition to the biosimilarity statement, noting that it \"could create needless confusion for patients,\" and that this statement \"does not serve a practical function.", "The biosimilar product is not required by FDA to have the same labeling as the reference product; for example, the number of approved indications for use may differ.", "FDA recommends that comparative data demonstrating biosimilarity not be included in biosimilar product labeling \"to avoid potential confusion or misinterpretation of the comparative data.", "\"83 However, such comparative data are available to prescribers and the public on the FDA website.84 Comments on the FDA labeling guidance reflected differing views: while the generic industry wants less information in biosimilar labeling, the brand-name industry would like FDA to require more information.85", "In contrast, the Biotechnology Innovation Organization (BIO), which represents makers of brand-name biologics, stated that more information is preferable to less with regard to labeling.", "\"The prescribing physician needs to have access to all relevant information, including the relevant nonclinical and clinical data supporting the finding of biosimilarity, and the resulting labeling should be transparent to allow the prescriber to identify whether the described studies were conducted with the biosimilar or reference product.\"86", "Another factor that may affect uptake of biosimilars is that a biosimilar generally cannot be automatically substituted for the reference product (i.e., brand-name biologic) at the pharmacy-level unless it is determined to be interchangeable with the reference product.", "An interchangeable product \"can be expected to produce the same clinical result as the reference product in any given patient and, for a biological product that is administered more than once, that the risk of alternating or switching between use of the biosimilar product and the reference product is not greater than the risk of maintaining the patient on the reference product.", "Interchangeable products may be substituted for the reference product by a pharmacist without the intervention of the prescribing health care provider.", "\"87 In January 2017, FDA released draft guidance on interchangeability, and final guidance on May 10, 2019.88 FDA has not yet approved an interchangeable product.", "As mentioned previously, a generic drug generally is considered to be interchangeable with its reference (brand-name) drug and with other generic products that use the same reference drug.", "All states have enacted laws that allow or require a pharmacist to substitute a generic for the reference drug.", "Following passage of the Hatch-Waxman Act, one major source of cost saving was the ability of a pharmacist to substitute a generic drug for a brand-name drug without the intervention of a health care provider.", "However, because a biosimilar is not structurally identical to its brand-name biologic, assessing interchangeability is a separate process.", "In the United States, FDA regulates the drug product but the states regulate pharmacies and the practice of pharmacy.", "According to the National Conference of State Legislatures (NCSL), as of October 22, 2018 \"at least 49 states have considered legislation establishing state standards for substitution of a biosimilar prescription product to replace an original biologic product.", "\"89 NCSL indicates that a total of 45 states and Puerto Rico have enacted legislation; the provisions of state legislation vary.90", "Another factor that may affect biosimilar competition is access to samples of the reference product for purposes of biosimilar testing and development.", "As aforementioned, before a company may market a biosimilar, it must demonstrate that its product is highly similar to a reference product.", "Such comparative testing generally necessitates access to samples of a reference product.91 FDA has reported receiving numerous inquiries from biosimilar product developers indicating that they would like to develop a biosimilar version of a marketed drug, but are unable to obtain the necessary samples of a reference product.", "Some brand-name companies have implicated FDA-mandated safety programs—risk evaluation and mitigation strategies or REMS—for why they are not willing to sell samples to the biosimilar product developer, including that generic product developers may not ensure the safe use of these drugs, and that the brand company could be held liable.92 A REMS-restricted distribution program controls or limits the chain of supply to ensure drug safety.", "For biologics not subject to a REMS, companies have implemented self-imposed restricted distribution systems.", "By withholding access to samples, a brand-name company is generally able to prevent or delay a biosimilar product developer from conducting the required testing and submitting an application to FDA for review.", "In December 2018, FDA announced that it would start focusing on \"these same potentially anticompetitive practices\" as it already has with chemical drugs.93 For example, for chemical drugs, in December 2014, FDA issued draft guidance outlining the steps that a generic developer should take to obtain a letter from FDA to the brand company, indicating that its proposed testing protocol is comparably as safe as the brand company's REMS, and that it would not be a violation of the REMS to provide the product samples for such testing.94 FDA announced that it would set up a similar system for biosimilar product developers, although FDA cannot compel a company to sell samples to another sponsor.", "Additionally, for chemical drugs, FDA has published on its website a list of products for which it has received sample access inquiries related to limited distribution of the brand drug.95 It is not clear whether FDA will publish a similar list for biosimilar product inquiries.", "Out of the 76 approved REMS, 15 cover BLAs.96 However, the agency said it was evaluating how it could make it easier for biosimilar product developers to use reference products from outside the United States where they may be cheaper and more accessible.97 Additionally, legislation has been introduced that would aim to keep brand companies from using REMS and non-REMS restricted distribution systems to prevent or delay biosimilars (and generic drugs) from entering the market.98", "The high costs of pharmaceuticals in general—and biologics in particular—has led to an increased interest in understanding the federal government's role in the development of costly new therapeutics.", "In the case of many biosimilars approved by FDA, the associated brand-name biologic (i.e., the reference product) was originally discovered by scientists at public-sector research institutions.", "These brand-name biologics—for example, Remicade, Enbrel, Humira, Avastin—are among the top-selling drugs in the United States and worldwide.", "In general, the federal government—through the work conducted or supported by NIH—tends to focus more on basic or preclinical research and the pharmaceutical industry concentrates more of its research funding on clinical trials rather than on discovery activity.99 When trying to assign credit for specific therapeutic advancements, drawing a line between basic and applied research can be challenging.", "For example, without a major underlying advance, like recombinant DNA, the development of whole new classes of drugs would not have occurred.", "Various studies have attempted to quantify the contribution of publicly funded research to the discovery of new drugs.", "A study published in 2003 found that of the 284 new drugs approved by FDA from 1990 through 1999, 6.7% originated from sources other than private industry.100 A 1993 study found that 7.6% of new drugs approved from 1981 through 1990 originated from nonindustry sources.101", "However, rather than focusing on all drug approvals—including many \"me too\"102 drugs—another approach is to look at the origin of truly innovative new drugs, what FDA calls new molecular entities (NMEs).", "NMEs are drugs that have not been approved by FDA previously and frequently provide important new therapies for patients.103 A 2010 study found that of the NMEs and new biologics that received FDA approval between 1998 and 2007, 24.1% originated from work that was publicly funded.104", "A study by Stevens et al., published in 2011 claims to be more comprehensive than these earlier investigations.105", "The Stevens study identified 153 FDA-approved pharmaceutical products—102 NMEs, 36 biologics, and 15 vaccines—that were discovered at least in part by public-sector research institutions (PSRIs) from 1970 through 2009.", "About half of these drugs fell into two therapeutic categories: oncology and infectious disease. The study also examined more broadly new drug applications (NDAs), not including biologics, approved from 1990 through 2007.", "The study identified 1,541 approved NDAs, which includes, but is not limited to, drugs that are NMEs; new esters, salts, or derivatives; and new formulations, combinations, and indications of previously approved drugs.", "Of the 1,541 NDAs approved by FDA from 1990 through 2007, 143, or 9.3%, resulted from work conducted in publicly funded labs.", "The 2011 Stevens study considered a PSRI \"to have participated in the applied phase of research that led to discovery of a drug if it, solely or jointly, created intellectual property specific to the drug that was subsequently transferred to a company through a commercial license.\"", "The methodology used by the Stevens study \"excluded the role of PSRIs in the development of platform technologies that have contributed to the development of whole new classes of drugs.\"", "For example, the following platform technologies were all developed with public funds and were excluded from the study:", "Although these platform technologies enabled the development of many of the products approved by FDA during the period evaluated in the study, they were excluded \"because the PSRI scientists who developed the platforms generally did not use them to develop specific drug candidates.\"107", "However, without these platform technologies, many new drugs would not have been developed, resulting perhaps in a vastly different economic outlook for the pharmaceutical industry.", "In general, biological products are regulated (licensed for marketing) under the Public Health Service Act—originally by the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and its precursors and later, starting in 1972, by the FDA—and

form the National Center for Drugs and Biologics.114 In 1988, the Center for Drugs and Biologics was split into the Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER) and the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research (CBER).115 CBER continued to use NIH facilities and buildings until it moved in October 2014 to the new FDA headquarters in White Oak, MD.116", "Because biotechnology products frequently cross the conventional boundaries between biologics, drugs, and devices, determining the jurisdictional status of these products has been difficult for both the FDA and industry.", "Some

stated that traditional biologics (vaccines, blood, blood products, antitoxins, allergenic products), as well as most biotechnology products, would be regulated by CBER.", "The small set of biologics regulated as drugs under the FFDCA (mentioned above) would continue to be regulated by CDER, regardless of the method of manufacture.", "In 2002, however, the FDA announced its intention to reorganize review responsibilities, consolidating review of new pharmaceutical products under CDER, thereby letting CBER to concentrate on vaccines, blood safety, gene therapy, and tissue transplantation.119 On June 30, 2003, responsibility for most therapeutic biologics was transferred from CBER to CDER.120 Under this structure, biological products transferred to CDER are regulated as licensed biologics under Section 351 of the PHSA.", "Examples of products transferred to CDER include monoclonal antibodies, immunomodulators (other than vaccines and allergenic products), growth factors, and cytokines.121 Remaining at CBER are traditional biologics such as vaccines, allergenic products, antitoxins, antivenins, venoms, and blood and blood products, including recombinant versions of plasma derivatives (clotting factors produced via biotechnology).", "FDA first gained the authority to collect user fees from the manufacturers of brand-name prescription drugs and biological products in 1992, when Congress passed the Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA).122 With PDUFA, FDA, industry, and Congress reached an agreement on two concepts: (1) performance goals—FDA would negotiate with industry on target completion times for various review processes, and (2) use of fees—the revenue from prescription drug user fees would be used only for activities to support the review of new product applications and would supplement—rather than supplant—congressional appropriations to FDA.", "The added resources from user fees allowed FDA to increase staff available to review applications and to reduce the median review time for standard applications.", "Over the years, Congress has added similar authority regarding medical devices, animal drugs, and generic human drugs.123 User fees made up almost 50% of the FY2019 FDA budget.", "The BPCIA, enacted as Title VII of the ACA, directed FDA to develop and present to Congress recommendations for a user fee program to support review of

However, we want you to make the most beneficial decision for your business, so we offer a free sample that you can download by submitting the below form", "By GlobalData1990s: new drug delivery technologies", "In the late 1980s, Californian company ALZA Corporation began work on a transdermal drug delivery patch containing fentanyl.", "This patch, called Duragesic, was eventually approved for patients with chronic pain who had become tolerant to other opiates.", "With many generic versions now available, it remains the most successful fentanyl product, and has earned a place on the World Health Organization’s List of Essential Medicines.", "Meanwhile another company, Anesta Corporation, began working on oral delivery methods for fentanyl. A lollipop-like product, Actiq, was approved in 1998.", "It is indicated for cancer patients who are receiving, and have become tolerant to, around-the-clock opioid therapy for their cancer pain.", "Many other products were subsequently approved, including an effervescent lozenge, a sublingual tablet and a buccal spray.", "The most recent addition to the list is Onsolis, a film that dissolves in the mouth, which was approved for cancer pain in 2015.", "By the beginning of the 21st century, fentanyl in all its forms had become a widely used analgesic, providing pain relief to thousands of patients.", "However, its potency made it extremely vulnerable to misuse, both accidental and otherwise.", "In 2005, the FDA began a continuing investigation into Duragesic, following on from a spate of deaths and overdoses.", "Its second Public Health Advisory, released in 2007, stated that some doctors were inappropriately prescribing the patch and that some patients were incorrectly using it.", "Meanwhile, the Actiq lollipop was being widely prescribed ‘off-label’. According to research conducted by ImpactRx, between June 2005 and October 2006, more than 80% of patients who used the drug didn’t have cancer.", "Around this time, there was also an uptick in reports of illicit recreational use. Between 2005 and 2007, the US Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) identified over 1,000 deaths associated with illegally manufactured non-pharmaceutical fentanyl.", "There were several seizures of illicit fentanyl, including a raid on a lab that was manufacturing counterfeit OxyContin.", "Following a raid on a single Mexican lab in 2007, the problem subsided for a while, with other opiates (such as prescription drugs and heroin) commanding the headlines.", "However, around 2013, street use of fentanyl began to climb again, particularly in north-eastern states such as New Hampshire and Massachusetts.", "From there, it spread to Ohio and Florida, and into other parts of the US and Canada. Some of the drug supply came from Mexico, and was brought into North America by traffickers, with most of the rest originating in China.", "With fentanyl often sold as heroin (a far less potent drug), accidental overdose became all too easy, and fatalities increased year on year.", "As Thomas Frieden, director of the Centers for Disease Control and Protection, put it in 2016: “As overdose deaths involving heroin more than quadrupled since 2010, what was a slow stream of illicit fentanyl, a synthetic opioid 50 to 100 times stronger than morphine, is now a flood.”", "In April 2016, the fentanyl crisis claimed its first high-profile victim, the singer Prince. It wasn’t clear whether or not he knew he was taking fentanyl.", "The same year, Time reported that carfentanil, a fentanyl analogue, was being sold on the streets. Around 100 times stronger than fentanyl (10,000 times stronger than morphine), the drug had previously been used as an elephant tranquiliser and had even been flagged up as a potential agent of chemical warfare.", "Even handling the drug can be dangerous, and ingesting just a few grains can prove fatal.", "According to US Government figures, 64,000 people died from drug overdoses in the US in 2016, with over 20,000 of those deaths attributable to synthetic opioids (mostly fentanyl).", "Fentanyl deaths increased by 540% over just three years, leading some to term this surge the ‘third wave’ of the opioid crisis.", "While more recent figures aren’t yet available, it is clear the problem hasn’t abated. In October last year, US President Donald Trump declared the opioid crisis a public health emergency.", "Meanwhile, the DEA’s latest national drug threat assessment reiterates the ongoing threat. It states: “Fentanyl is increasingly mixed with diluents and sold as heroin, often with no heroin present in the product.", "Fentanyl also continues to be made more widely available in the form of counterfeit prescription pills marketed for illicit street sales.”", "There are also fears that illicit fentanyl may spread beyond North America, into the street drug trades of Europe and Australia.", "“We have seen in the last 18 months the rapid emergence of new highly potent synthetic opioids, mostly fentanyl derivatives,” said Paul Griffiths, scientific director of the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction.", "“Their potency means they pose a significant risk to those that consume them or are accidentally exposed to them.”", "To date, it is hard to say what can be done about the crisis, with the Trump administration yet to take concrete action.", "However, as its tragic ramifications continue to unfold, it is clear that urgent solutions are needed."]}

The proposed rule did not specify that \"revised criteria\" might be used to determine eligibility for pass-through status, as Ortho had suggested weeks before.", "Nor did CMS intimate that it might use its \"other adjustment\" authority to equate Aranesp's reimbursement level with Procrit's.", "CMS proposed to use mechanisms other than imputed acquisition cost ratios to compute pass-through amounts for a limited number of drugs and biologicals.", "For drugs that are new and are substitutes for a single drug whose cost is recognized in a unique APC, the pass-through amount would equal the difference between 95 percent of the AWP for the pass-through drug and the payment rate for the comparable dose of the associated drug.", "The payment rate for the comparable dose of the associated drug also would be used to determine the copayment amount for the pass-through drug.", "Id. at 52,118. In the proposed rule, CMS indicated that darbepoetin alfa, that is, Aranesp, \"is a new substitute of epoetin (Procrit).\"", "Id. at 52,118.

Of all the CEOs who have gone through Korn Ferry’s comprehensive leadership performance simulation, the top 20% of performers had markedly more experience in four specific areas that demarcate great CEOs: driving growth, managing crises, developing strategies, and managing finances.", "Another notable strength of successful CEOs is learning agility, a key predictor of success, which Korn Ferry defines as the willingness and ability to apply lessons learned from past experiences to new and first-time situations and challenges.", "(In other words, it’s knowing what to do when you don’t know what to do.) Learning-agile leaders are nimble, adaptable in changing environments, and insatiably curious.", "Instead of defaulting to solutions and problem-solving tactics that worked in the past, learning-agile leaders apply fresh and varied approaches, ideas, solutions, and techniques to address new problems and unforeseen challenges.", "Highly learning-agile CEOs also tend to have other desirable qualities: dealing well with (and actually enjoying) ambiguity and complexity; being reflective and insightful; embracing new things and different approaches; and willingly assuming accountability and ultimate responsibility, particularly when things fail.", "They move beyond the status quo, having an orientation of how to “put ourselves out of business” by abandoning the old.", "Looking more deeply at best-in-class CEO profiles, Korn Ferry’s analysis reveals four additional strengths and desirable attributes that coincide with a strong right-brain orientation:", "- Social leadership, or the ability to inspire, influence, and motivate others", "- “Outside-in” thinking (a strong mega-trend and customer focus)", "- Courage, particularly during adversity and crisis", "Pulling these traits and attributes together produces a comprehensive picture of the best-in-class CEOs who possess both left-brain technical competencies (e.g., a strategic mind-set and financial acumen), some of which can be learned in business school, and right-brain attributes (e.g., social leadership to influence, motivate, and inspire others) that don’t necessarily come with an MBA.", "CFO vs. CEO: Left-brain parallels and right-brain gaps.", "Given the balance of left-brain and right-brain competencies possessed by best-in-class CEOs, how do CFOs compare?", "A comparison of leadership profiles reveals that the two executives are similar in several largely left-brain technical competencies (Figure 5): the quality of decisions, strategic mind-set, knowledge of global markets, and the ability to align execution to ensure that priorities are met.", "CFOs, as expected, score high in financial acumen, exceeding the average competency of CEOs.", "CEOs greatly outshine CFOs, however, in right-brain competencies, especially those that correspond with social leadership traits that reflect the typical CEO’s extroversion and ability to interact fluidly", "with a diverse group of people. For the typical CFO who aspires to become CEO, the right-brain traits may be a significant gap.", "With heavy reliance on left-brain technical skills, CFOs tend to be very linear in their approach, which is consistent with a more narrowly defined position in which one is highly cognizant of rules and regulations.", "CEOs, on the other hand, are less apt to tell people what to do and instead guide them to what they should think about.", "When it comes to vision and innovation, CEOs have an edge over CFOs, but the two are closer than people might think.", "Given that nearly 50% of CFOs have public accounting backgrounds, however, they are typically very compartmentalized, seeing things in black and white and focusing strongly on managing risk.", "CEOs, on the other hand, are more focused on fostering and managing innovation. Said another way, CFOs are more likely to color within the lines, while CEOs paint the lines.", "CFOs know how to say no and, given their oversight of capital deployment, people often expect them to say no.", "CEOs, however, need to say no in a way that does not dampen enthusiasm or creativity. To expand their leadership, CFOs must become more agile and comfortable making decisions when there are not black and white answers.", "Using their social leadership skills, CEOs can navigate their organizations and influence others in ways that CFOs generally cannot.", "Although CFOs are responsible for the development of their teams, they typically have not had as much experience influencing and guiding people who do not report directly to them.", "Two other right-brain attributes that CEOs possess in abundance compared to CFOs are courage, which allows them to step up to address difficult issues and say what needs to be said, and optimism.", "These two traits help CEOs face challenges and uncertainty with confidence while they also provide a steadying influence on others.", "Courage provides the mental and emotional fortitude to navigate difficult and sometimes dire times (the 2008-09 financial crisis and the recession that followed are perfect examples), while optimism is the encouragement to persevere.", "A CEO’s courage is often the result of having faced many adverse and critical experiences over the years.", "A Korn Ferry analysis shows that, even among C-suite executives with the same number of years in management positions, CEOs typically have far more experience than CFOs in dealing with adversity, inherited problems and challenges, interpersonally challenging situations, downturns and failures, and difficult staffing situations.", "CEOs also tend to handle more high-risk and high-profile situations, critical negotiations, and crisis management over the course of their careers than CFOs.", "The CEO’s right-brain leadership strengths build and leverage relationships and influence among the two most important constituencies: employees and customers.", "Having an “inside-out” perspective, CEOs understand the employee point of view of such internal forces as leadership, people, organizational capability and alignment, infrastructure, technology, et cetera.", "Conversely, when they look “outside-in,” their strong customer focus equates to a commercial temperament about the marketplace and an almost intuitive sense of what new or improved products and services customers will want.", "They can gauge a plethora of external forces, including mega-trends, competitors, product innovation, and new markets, from customers’ perspectives.", "With the full complement of their skills—left-brain and right-brain—CEOs drive results. Here is yet another differentiator between CFOs and CEOs: Although CFOs are responsible for reporting the results, they seldom are fired for them.", "A CEO, however, will be fired, which raises the stakes for social leadership skills deployed inside and outside the organization.", "Although certain experiences build leadership skills and competencies, there are aspects of the CEO role for which there is no adequate preparation.", "From personal experience, I can attest that until someone becomes CEO, it is impossible to fully comprehend the “all-in” intensity of the job.", "Earlier in my career at Korn Ferry, when I was an operating officer and a CFO, I could still be one of the guys.", "People viewed me as a person, not as a function. I was even allowed to have a bad day once in a while without worrying about whether my mood affected the company.", "Then I became the CEO. Suddenly, people were reading my mood as if it were tea leaves. I wasn’t speaking just for myself anymore.", "represented a position and an institution. Motivating and inspiring people, displaying optimism in the face of challenges, and being highly attuned to others took on great importance.", "This realization prompted me to change my communication style, shifting away from the PowerPoints I relied on as a CFO (a pie chart never inspired anyone) to focus as much on my tone, attitude, and the energy with which I spoke and interacted with others as I did on what I had to tell them.", "Other leaders who were promoted from CFO to CEO describe similar experiences. Indra Nooyi became president and CFO of PepsiCo in 2001, before stepping into the CEO role five years later.", "As she candidly described in a conversation we had, nothing could quite prepare her for the demands of the job: “The one thing I have learned as a CEO is that leadership at various levels is vastly different.", "When I was leading a function or a business, there were certain demands and requirements to be a leader.", "As you move up in the organization, the requirements for leading that organization don’t grow vertically, they grow exponentially. ...", "When you are the CEO, the responsibilities multiply enormously because you worry about everything,” said Nooyi, who continues to serve as PepsiCo’s chairman and CEO.", "CEOs are often thrust into the spotlight—literally. For example, as a CEO I have delivered speeches in front of 5,000 people without PowerPoint slides; participated in a high-profile business forum in front of a live audience (no notes, no slides) bookended by Howard Schultz of Starbucks and Angela Ahrendts, former CEO of Burberry and now senior vice president of retail and online stores for Apple; gone toe-to-toe with a news anchor on live television; and sat in a tiny studio with nothing but a bright light and a robotic camera for company while waiting to be interviewed by remote feed.", "Even the best media training offers an inadequate dress rehearsal to face the spotlight and to speak not for myself but for the organization.", "At the other end of the spectrum, CEOs need emotional intelligence to handle personal interactions, from delivering a eulogy for a senior leader to intense one-on-one conversations.", "At the end of the day, leadership is all about how you make others feel, no matter what the topic, situation, or challenge—even if someone is being fired.", "CFOs aspiring to be CEOs must first look in the mirror.", "It is hard work for CFOs (and other C-level leaders) to close the gaps in their competencies to become CEOs.", "They must have the right motivation for doing so. Ego does not suffice, nor does the assumption that moving from CFO to CEO is the next logical career step.", "Many very talented and highly valued CFOs choose to stay in their roles and hone their financial and strategic leadership expertise to become best-in-class.", "In fact, in a recent survey, fewer than two-thirds of CFOs (64%) indicated an interest in becoming CEOs.", "For those CFOs who truly believe they are capable of assuming a broader leadership role, the process begins with the self-awareness needed to move beyond what is comfortable and develop the requisite broader array of leadership strengths.", "Fortunately, many best-in-class CFOs are learning-agile, which is a real asset for taking on new challenges and expanding skills.", "Even within learning agility, however, there is room for CFOs to improve. Learning agility can be separated into five factors: self-awareness, especially of one’s strengths and weaknesses; mental agility, or being comfortable with complexity and making fresh connections; people agility, or possessing exceptional communication skills and knowing how to get things done through others; change agility, or a passion for ideas and high interest in continuous development; and results agility, or the ability to deliver results in first-time situations through one’s own drive and by inspiring others.", "Of these five, CFOs are strongest in results agility (reflective of their financial acumen) and are comparable to CEOs in self-awareness, while CEOs have an edge in mental agility and in change agility.", "The most noticeable gap for CFOs is in people agility, which is consistent with their need to develop more social leadership skills to influence, engage, and inspire others.", "Developing more people agility is a crucial aspect of right-brain leadership that CFOs will need to develop to move into the CEO role.", "It is a fact of leadership life: The technical skills and competencies leaders possess are what got them where they are today.", "Depending too much on what worked in the past, however, may not lead to", "future success. There are industries (for example, utilities post-deregulation) when CFOs’ left-brain financial engineering skills (e.g.,knowledge of capital markets and deploying capital) are highly desirable for the CEO role.", "In most industries, however, CFOs who want to become CEOs must intentionally take on new challenges and make the necessary career moves to gain more diverse experience and develop deeper social leadership skills.", "The typical career path for CFOs who aspire to become CEOs frequently takes them into operating roles, often as chief operating executives or presidents of large divisions, even if their compensation exceeds the typical salary for that position.", "Nonetheless, the company is willing to make that investment to broaden the CFO’s competences and experiences as a potential CEO successor.", "Even more important than expanding the CFO’s knowledge of the business or industry through an operating role are the opportunities to engage more fully with others both inside and outside the organizations.", "As architects of capital allocation and with a clear understanding of the organization’s strategy, CFOs often act as advisors and business partners to general managers—e.g., setting the guidelines of how much can be invested or the metrics to be used.", "By taking on general management responsibilities, CFOs broaden their engagement with others, including building trust and working collaboratively across the organization.", "CFOs who want to become CEOs one day must be able to establish and articulate a vision to engage and inspire thousands of people who will then want to follow them.", "A notable example of a CFO whose career path has led to expanding operational responsibilities is Thomas Staggs of Disney.", "A 25-year veteran of the company, Staggs was named chair of Walt Disney Parks and Resorts in 2010 and in February 2015 was promoted to COO.", "In his latest role, Staggs shares oversight of much of the senior management team, including the heads of all business segments, with Disney CEO Robert Iger.", "Other CFOs who have taken on broader leadership roles include Keith Sherin, vice chairman of General Electric and CEO of its GE Capital unit; Safra Catz, co-CEO of Oracle; John Martin, chairman and CEO of Turner Broadcasting System, a unit of Time Warner; and Robert Bradway, chairman and CEO of Amgen, who also served as president and COO.", "Companies also can get creative in developmental assignments for a sitting CFO. For example, one company put its CFO in charge of a global operating committee even though none of the members reported to him.", "The CFO became so adept at using influence and other social leadership skills while gaining in-depth understanding of enterprise-wide operating issues that he became a leading candidate for CEO succession.", "CFOs who want to move ahead must to seize opportunities to broaden their skills and gain new experiences.", "For example, a CFO who acts as the understudy for the CEO for certain events may seek more of a co-presenter role, moving beyond the PowerPoints of the financials to delivering a message that will engage and inspire others.", "Having a personal life full of rich experiences carries benefits beyond the intrinsic. For example, traveling to different cultures and environments broadens one’s perspective and exposes people to greater diversity.", "A passion for the arts can spark more creative, innovative thinking. Community service, whether on the local or national level, expresses one’s interest to support a particular cause or issue while providing new experiences to engage with others.", "Chairing a philanthropic board whose volunteer members don’t report to anyone requires the leader to encourage more participation by understanding how and why others are engaged.", "In summary, wherever the CFO’s career development path leads, it must surpass left-brain technical competencies.", "Greater right-brain leadership, in particular people and relationship skills, is needed to beat the odds for CFOs who have their eyes on the CEO role.", "Stay on top of the latest leadership news with This Week in Leadership—delivered weekly and straight into your inbox."]}

Evidence Related to Defendant's April 1998 Assault on Sylvia", "The defense offered additional testimony regarding defendant's prior assault of Sylvia in 1998.

However, according to Sylvia, a few moments later, defendant jumped up and attacked her by trying to gouge out her eye.", "Sylvia and her children escaped the house and ran to a neighbor's home for assistance.

She reported to Sergeant Gray that her husband was \"very agitated\" because they had been arguing about the writing of their wills.", "Sylvia told the officer that when she attempted to go back to bed, defendant attacked her, threw her across the bedroom, tossed her into the entertainment unit, knocked the television on the floor, and then attempted to injure one of her eyes with his finger.", "After interviewing Sylvia, Sergeant Gray entered defendant's residence and examined the bedroom. The room was disheveled, and the television was on the floor.", "Defendant was not taken to the hospital because he appeared to be in good health. At the police station, defendant refused to be fingerprinted and was uncooperative.", "However, nothing about defendant's demeanor at the police station caused Gray to believe defendant needed medical attention.", "Dana Litke of the Prosecutor's Office testified that, although defendant was indicted for second-degree and third-degree aggravated assault after the 1998 attack, Sylvia had requested that the charges be dropped.", "Specifically, Sylvia had stated that the children were upset, that defendant was a good father, and that she did not want him removed from the home.", "As a result of her input, a \"significant downgrade\" was provided, allowing defendant to plead guilty to simple assault.", "During defendant's case, in an effort to show his client's history of unusual behavior, defense counsel called several police officers.", "The officers described, among other things, the police report substantiating the April 1998 incident between Sylvia and defendant.", "In support of defendant's claim that he had struck the older daughter in self-defense in 2003, defendant questioned Charles DeFebbo of the Prosecutor's Office about a photograph taken of the crime scene.", "The photograph showed that defendant's back had a two-inch abrasion.", "The defense presented testimony at trial from psychiatrist Stephen Samuel, M.D., an expert in neuropsychology and the treatment of seizure disorders.", "Dr. Samuel evaluated defendant three times in June and July of 2004. He issued expert reports in September 2004 and October 2004.", "None of the expert reports or the corresponding trial exhibits have been included in the record on appeal.", "Dr. Samuel testified that he had reviewed records that reflected that defendant had been discharged from the military in Argentina due to a seizure disorder.", "Defendant had an abnormal electroencephalogram (\"EEG\"), which indicated the possible presence of a seizure disorder.", "Dr. Samuel also reviewed records from 1998 by Dr. Steven Mandel, Dr. Gary Glass, and Dr. Scott Tzorfas, all of whom had previously examined defendant.", "When Dr. Samuel examined defendant, he performed several neurological tests. He ascertained that defendant's I.Q. was in the borderline range.", "According to Dr. Samuel, defendant suffered from anxiety and depression. Dr. Samuel also related that as a result of his mental disorder, defendant perceived aggression in exchanges with other people that were actually neutral.", "Additionally, Dr. Samuel explained that a seizure could last up to six hours and that after a seizure, an individual could be confused, incoherent, and psychotic due to a detachment from reality.", "The records that Dr. Samuel reviewed reflected that at the time of incident in 1998, defendant was acting strangely, tried to jump out of a two-story window, had tremendous strength, and assaulted his wife.", "According to Dr. Samuel, Dr. Glass had believed that the 1998 assault was due to a seizure and was unintentional, and that defendant did not understand at the time that he was doing anything wrong.", "Based on his review of the records, Dr. Samuel found similarities in defendant's behavior between his 1998 assault on his wife and the September 2003 incident.", "However, at the State's request, the court struck his opinion testimony relating to the April 1998 incident, because Dr. Samuel had not written any expert report addressing defendant's state of mind or any aspect of the 1998 incident.", "The court made clear that it was only striking Dr. Samuel's \"conclusion\" regarding the 1998 incident, not Dr. Samuel's other testimony about the incident or what was in the reports from that time.", "Dr. Samuel noted that, in the weeks preceding the stabbing in 2003, defendant's treating physician had requested that defendant take a smaller dosage of his seizure medicine.", "In addition, prior to the 2003 attacks, defendant had smelled odors that did not exist, saw colors that were not present, and found that food tasted strange.", "Dr. Samuel explained in this regard that people with seizure disorders can have olfactory hallucinations.", "Dr. Samuel further opined that defendant's claim that he could not remember the stabbing was consistent with a seizure.", "Dr. Samuel opined that the testing revealed that defendant was not faking his medical condition, that defendant had epilepsy, and that, as a result, defendant did not know he was committing wrongful acts on September 15, 2003.", "More specifically, Dr. Samuel concluded that at the time of the September 2003 episode, defendant was \"laboring under defective reasoning\" and did not understand the nature of the acts he was committing.", "On cross-examination, Dr. Samuel acknowledged that he did not examine defendant immediately after the 2003 stabbing, but instead saw him almost one year later.", "The defense expert also acknowledged that, in an effort to improve their pending legal difficulties, some individuals might be motivated to feign poor health when they met him for an evaluation.", "Dr. Samuel would not state definitively whether or not defendant actually could remember the stabbing.", "Dr. Samuel also acknowledged that there were no violent episodes following other changes in defendant's medications.", "Dr. Samuel further agreed on cross-examination that, based on past medical reports, defendant's typical seizures had lasted two to three minutes and that he would be incoherent and lethargic afterwards.", "The defense expert conceded that aggressive outbursts were rare when an individual was experiencing a seizure.", "In such instances, the aggression would typically be a response to another person's touch, rather than \"directly aggressive violence.\"", "Dr. Samuel's cross-examination also explored the significance of the April 1998 incident as described by Dr. Tzorfas.", "Defendant was evaluated by Dr. Tzorfas in the emergency room after the incident, but defendant's EEG did not reveal any seizure activity at that time.", "Instead, Dr. Tzorfas had described that incident as a \"severe aggressive outburst,\" which was psychiatric in nature and not related to defendant's seizure disorder.", "Dr. Samuel recognized that defendant periodically pushed his wife and may have also pushed his children.", "Nevertheless, Dr. Samuel would not characterize defendant as generally being \"aggressive\" to his family.", "Acknowledging that he had found defendant to be \"paranoid,\" Dr. Samuel further admitted on cross-examination that being paranoid did not necessarily mean that an individual could not tell right from wrong or that he or she was incapable of acting knowingly and purposely.", "Dr. Samuel agreed that defendant was conscious and aware on the date of the September 2003 episode and that he had memories of the events that took place at the restaurant and the tournament prior to the attacks.", "In addition, defendant recalled returning home, setting the security alarm, going to sleep, hearing a cricket, getting up in the morning, and going to the kitchen.", "Defendant was also able to recount certain discrete memories of the stabbings, such as knowing his daughter was on his back, feeling scared, hiding, hearing the police, and being pepper sprayed.", "Dr. Samuel also agreed that pulling knives out of a butchers block and returning them to that location required both motor skill and control.", "Dr. Samuel also conceded that trying to kick the window of a police car demonstrated an individual's control over his or her cognitive and motor function.", "The defense also presented expert testimony from Dr. Gary Glass, another psychiatrist who had examined defendant.", "Dr. Glass first had been retained to examine defendant in relation to the 1998 criminal charges. Prior to testifying, Dr. Glass reviewed medical records from Argentina, as well as reports from Dr. Mandel, Dr. Tzorfas, Dr. Waldman, and Dr. Grove.", "He also reviewed various medical records from defendant's hospital admissions and prison medical records.", "According to Dr. Glass, defendant had \"bizarre awarenesses\" regarding the 2003 stabbing incident. For example, defendant remembered the stabbing, but did not recall seeing any blood.", "Defendant also asserted that the knife he used was made out of rubber and did not penetrate the flesh.", "Dr. Glass opined that individuals who experience seizures may suffer from different types of hallucinations.", "In discussing the various medical reports of other physicians, Dr. Glass highlighted the decision to reduce defendant's Depakote medication about three weeks before the stabbings.", "Dr. Glass also noted that defendant was once assessed at the psychiatric unit at Atlantic City Medical Center because he had claimed voices told him to spit at his wife and to punch a friend.", "Relying on Dr. Samuel's report and his own previous November 1998 evaluation of defendant, Dr. Glass concluded that defendant suffered from a complex, difficult-to-treat seizure disorder.", "According to Dr. Glass, defendant's seizures were never well controlled and stress increased them. Dr. Glass concluded that the 2003 stabbings and assaults were a direct result of defendant's seizure disorder and that defendant was not in control of his actions during that episode.", "On cross-examination, Dr. Glass acknowledged that he did not write his expert report until fourteen months after he examined defendant.", "Like Dr. Samuel, Dr. Glass agreed that in a forensic evaluation an individual may have an incentive to be dishonest to aid his or her court case.", "He also conceded that a person could fake hallucinations.", "Dr. Glass agreed that defendant had possessed the ability on the day of the 2003 stabbings to dial 9-1-1 and respond to commands from police.", "However, he maintained that defendant had not possessed conscious awareness on that day. Dr. Glass conceded that there was no way to determine definitively whether defendant was acting with purpose or knowledge at the time of the attacks.", "Defendant testified on his own behalf, mainly addressing his history of seizures and his actions prior to the 2003 attacks.", "He described a seizure as being on a roller coaster, and stated that he felt confused after a seizure.", "According to defendant, the 1998 assault on Sylvia was due to his not taking his medicine. Defendant further noted that, in the weeks prior to the September 2003 episode, his medicine regimen had been modified and lowered.", "As recounted by defendant, the day before the 2003 attacks, he had assisted with the karate tournament.", "Then he went to eat at a restaurant that evening. He felt hot, smelled bad odors, and sensed that there was a problem with the taste of the food.", "He recalled experiencing the same symptoms upon returning home and then going to bed. According to defendant, his sleep was disrupted by a scratching sound on the window, a cricket chirping, and a vision of \"the walls coming in, and back to me with [] little stars.\"", "Although defendant recalled following his wife Sylvia to the kitchen the next morning, he did not remember attacking anyone.", "However, defendant did remember being handcuffed by the police and being neutralized with pepper spray.", "H. Testimony of the State's Expert, Dr. Greenfield", "In its rebuttal case, the State called Daniel Greenfield, M.D., a psychiatrist, as its expert. Dr. Greenfield generally described \"symptoms of epilepsy or seizure disorder\" as \"an uncoordinated discharge of electrical energy in different parts of the brain and[,] depending on where they occur, that will determine what some of the symptoms are.\"", "Dr. Greenfield further noted that in some \"so-called generalized instances\" of a seizure, \"a person will have tonic-clonic seizures or fits.\"", "He added that \"[a] person will have jerking movements that that individual doesn't remember and that individual is not controlling.", "epileptic seizures tend to occur in short bursts, whether they are the so-called generalized tonic-clonic movement, a person shaking a lot or maybe the word is incontinent of urine, which means you release the urine.", "You don't have control over it during the seizure and you do other bad things for your body, like bite your tongue.", "He added that \"[t]hose things characteristically occur during the so-called generalized tonic-clonic seizures.\"", "As compared with tonic-clonic seizures, a \"partial complex seizure[],\" according to Dr. Greenfield, is a type of \"generalized seizure\" in which the individual's movements or \"motor behaviors are not as uncoordinated as [the] gross motor movements\" exhibited during a tonic-clonic seizure.", "Dr. Greenfield cited sleepwalking as an example of such a partial complex seizure. Dr. Greenfield also described a third type of seizure where \"the individual will have a lapse of consciousness, a lapse of awareness of his environment . . .", "for a minute, minute and a half,\" and appear \"spacey\" or \"distracted.\" He continued, \"[b]ut the idea behind seizures is that unless they're controlled, they occur when they occur.", "They're uncoordinated. They're dysfunctional.\" And \"the kinds of behaviors that occur during them are not under an individual's voluntary control by definition.\"", "Having reviewed various documents and having clinically examined defendant, Dr. Greenfield concluded that defendant was not suffering from a seizure when he attacked his wife in 1998.", "Dr. Greenfield also noted several commonalities between the 1998 incident and the 2003 attack. In particular, both episodes, according to Dr. Greenfield, \"involved protracted and prolonged purposeful, angry, goal-directed behavior[.]\"", "Dr. Greenfield found significant that in defendant's thirty-five-year seizure history, his seizures were never longer than a few minutes, whereas in the two episodes in April 1998 and September 2003, the violent outbursts lasted much longer.", "According to Dr. Greenfield, it is uncommon for a seizure to last twelve to fifteen minutes, and it is likewise uncommon for an individual to be able to engage in goal-directed behavior during a seizure.", "In addition, Dr. Greenfield noted that individuals do not typically have violent outbursts while suffering from a seizure.", "Although persons experiencing a seizure will sometimes resist people trying to touch them, in what is called \"resistive violence,\" such defensive measures, according to Dr. Greenfield, normally last only approximately one to two minutes.", "Dr. Greenfield explained that after a seizure, a person may be confused for a few minutes to a half hour.", "He stated that the seizures that defendant periodically experienced from 1998 to 2003 were unlike both the April 1998 and September 2003 violent incidents.", "He further noted that he believed defendant had not experienced postictal psychosis (i.e., a period of uncontrollable behavior) on September 15, because his actions that day were not random or flailing.", "According to Dr. Greenfield, \"if violent outbursts\" had, in fact, been characteristic of defendant's seizures, he would have expected that defendant would have exhibited \"[n]ondirected behaviors.", "During Dr. Greenfield's examination of defendant, defendant recalled with clarity the events pertaining to the karate tournament and dinner the night before the September 2003 incident, as well as his exchange with his wife.", "Defendant recalled being on top of his wife on the floor in the kitchen, which was when he was allegedly having a seizure.", "Defendant further remembered his older daughter's jumping on his back, and even recalled Julia's trying to stop his attack upon Sylvia.", "Dr. Greenfield catalogued a number of other instances during the September 2003 episode, which reflected that defendant had a clear memory of exchanges at a time when, according to defendant, he was having a seizure.", "These memories and recollections, combined with defendant's history and the expert's clinical examination, led Dr. Greenfield to conclude that defendant had acted knowingly and purposefully during the September 2003 episode, with awareness, and in a goal-oriented manner.", "Dr. Greenfield concluded that defendant was able to distinguish right from wrong at the time, and he knew that he had behaved badly.", "Dr. Greenfield further opined that defendant was not suffering from a mental disease or defect at the time of the 2003 attacks and that he did not suffer from diminished capacity.", "Dr. Greenfield explained that Julia's injuries were instead consistent with directed stabs and blows intended to kill.", "He noted that Julia's burns from a hot substance further supported his opinion that defendant had acted with purpose and with a specific goal.", "As Dr. Greenfield put it, \"[defendant] formulated a plan. He carried it out. He was aware that he would get in trouble and he acted accordingly[.]\"", "The fact that defendant thereafter tried to hide in another room of the house further supported Dr. Greenfield's opinion that defendant \"realized that he was in trouble, no question, that he had done the wrong thing.\"", "Upon considering these proofs, the jury found defendant guilty of the following crimes charged in the indictment: first-degree murder of Julia, N.J.S.A. 2C:11-3a(1), -3a(2) (count one); second-degree aggravated assault of Sylvia, N.J.S.A. 2C:12-1b(1) (count two); third-degree aggravated assault with a deadly weapon upon Sylvia and the older daughter, N.J.S.A. 2C:12-1b(2) (counts four and five); third-degree possession of a weapon with an unlawful purpose, N.J.S.A. 2C:39-4d (counts six and seven); and third-degree aggravated assault against police officers, N.J.S.A. 2C:12-1b(5) (counts eight and nine).", "As to count three, which had charged defendant with aggravated assault upon the older daughter, the jury found defendant guilty of the lesser-included offense of simple assault, N.J.S.A. 2C:12-1a(1).", "On September 6, 2007, the trial court sentenced defendant as follows: forty years in prison for murder (count one) with an 85% parole disqualifier; six years for second-degree aggravated assault (count two) with an 85% parole disqualifier, to run consecutively to count one; four years for third-degree aggravated assault with a deadly weapon (count five), to run consecutively to counts one and two; and four years for each of the third-degree aggravated assaults against police officers (counts eight and nine), to run consecutively to count one.", "The court merged the simple assault conviction (count three) with the conviction for third-degree aggravated assault with a deadly weapon (count five).", "The court merged the third-degree aggravated assault with a deadly weapon conviction (count four) with the second-degree aggravated assault (count two), and also merged the third-degree possession of a weapon and the unlawful purpose convictions (counts six and seven) with counts one, two and five.", "On appeal, defendant raises the following points for our consideration:", "FAILURE OF THE STATE TO PROVE CULPABILITY PURSUANT TO N.J.S.A. 2C:2-2 PROHIBITS AFFIRMATION OF THE CONVICTION.", "INTENTIONAL WRONGDOING HAS NOT BEEN PROVEN BEYOND A REASONABLE DOUBT.", "[THE] STATE'S EXPERT [] TESTIMONY PERMITTED BY TRIAL COURT'S FAILURE TO ABIDE BY THE RULES OF EVIDENCE, REQUIRES REVERSAL OF THE JURY'S FINDING OF GUILT.", "(PARTIALLY RAISED BELOW AT TIME OF EVID. 404B HEARING).

As a general matter, he contends that the trial court erred by not considering his mental incapacity and other circumstances as mitigating factors, while allegedly double-counting certain aggravating factors.", "Beyond that, he asserts that it was error for the court to sentence him to consecutive jail terms for the attacks on the police officers and to sentence him at all for the \"simple assault\" on his daughter, which, he urges, was merely a result of her surprising him by jumping on him during the altercation.", "We reject these contentions and sustain the sentence that was imposed.", "We note that the jury in this case answered a special interrogatory and found that the \"aggravating factor\" of the nature and circumstances of the offense was proven beyond a reasonable doubt.", "In that same special interrogatory response, the jury rejected as an aggravating factor the gravity of the offense, in relation to what defendant knew about the victim's vulnerability.", "In sentencing defendant, the judge acknowledged the jury's findings on these factual matters.", "The judge specifically found the following aggravating factors under N.J.S.A. 2C:44-1a applicable: (1) the nature and circumstances of the offense and defendant's role; (3) the risk that defendant would commit another offense; (9) the need to deter defendant and others; and, to a limited degree, (12) the victim's age, though it noted that Julia was not the intended victim.", "N.J.S.A. 2C:44-1a(1), (3), (9), (12). The judge declined to apply aggravating factor six concerning the extent of a prior record.", "N.J.S.A. 2C:44-1a(6).

The judge found that factor to have \"great\" weight. The judge ultimately concluded that the aggravating and mitigating factors justified a \"mid-range\" sentence on each conviction.", "As noted in Part I, supra, the judge imposed a term of forty years on the murder, plus eighteen additional years of consecutive sentences on the related aggravated assaults on Sylvia, the older daughter, and the two police officers.", "The court also applied applicable periods of parole ineligibility.", "Our standard of review of the trial court's sentencing determinations is limited.

of peoples’ experiences, interviewers need to ask questions that elicit the particulars of those individual experiences (Chase, 2005).", "For this reason, if the goal is to understand the results of quantitative analyses, researchers may choose questions that lead to generalizations, while those developing questions as part of formative work that precedes and informs implementation of interventions may be more likely to use questions that result in detailed responses that will help to identify obstacles to implementation or opportunities for smoothing intervention roll-out.", "If the goal is to code qualitative responses so that they can be included in statistical analyses, interviewers must be sure to ask all participants these questions and probe for responses that can be clearly coded in either a binary or scalar fashion.", "Key informant interviews can range from loosely organized conversations to semi-structured interviews—the distinction between these interviews

1957), in D & I research, they are most commonly used early in developmental evaluations, or after implementation, to take advantage of the informant’s in-depth knowledge of the setting and how its characteristics may affect or have affected implementation.", "Key informant interviews can also be used during other phases of evaluation as a relatively quick and simple method for assessing effects of context on interventions, or on intervention processes, progress, and outcomes.", "Such interviews, though extremely helpful in obtaining an “insider’s” view, also provide unique perspectives that may not be representative of other stakeholders.", "Nevertheless, the best key informants are keen observers who often understand and report a range of stakeholder perspectives, even if they do not agree with those perspectives.", "They can help guide data collection and generate hypotheses in addition to providing insight and aiding understanding at different project phases.", "Corroboration and examination of hypotheses resulting from key informant interviews are important methods of integrating findings using multiple methods (Gilchrist & Williams, 1999).", "Compared to key informant interviews, individual in-depth interviews are typically designed to obtain deeper understandings of commonalities and differences among groups of individuals that share important characteristics or experiences, or to understand the perspectives of individuals at different points along a continuum of interest (Miller & Crabtree, 1999).", "In-depth interviews, in particular, are intended to elicit personal, intimate, and detailed narratives (Dicicco-Bloom & Crabtree, 2006).", "Their most important use in D & I projects is to shed light on the ways in which implementation processes interact with organizations and stakeholders to produce outcomes—both expected and unexpected.", "Recognizing that stakeholders’ primary responsibilities are rarely research focused, interview length and guides are constructed to address key research questions and be mindful of the exigencies experienced by those being interviewed.", "Therefore, interview guides for busy clinicians or administrators are often shorter and more narrowly focused; interviews with users of clinical services may be longer and, correspondingly, include questions that delve more deeply, with prompts to encourage additional exploration of interviewees’ experiences.", "Semi-structured interview guides are often adapted over time as data are analyzed and more is learned about the research question and the strengths and weaknesses of the guide (Charmaz, 2006).", "This adaptability makes semi-structured interviews—whether group or individual—extremely useful in mixed methods D & I research.", "Various designs are

Couper et al., 1998; Shiffman et al., 2008).", "While interviewer-administered surveys provide a high level of accuracy and more complete data, self-administered surveys are less costly and can provide greater confidentiality and improved respondent comfort (Tourangeau & Smith, 1996).", "Information technology-based approaches can increase accuracy and reduce human error, though they may require programming expertise and can be vulnerable to technology failures.", "Different modes of administration can be particularly useful in D & I research, with mode selected to optimize comfort for and response from the target population.", "Here too, qualitative data can provide information to researchers who are making decisions about which survey modalities are best for particular topics and participants.", "Using a combination of survey administration modes can optimize response rates while containing survey costs.", "For example, if formative work suggests that significant proportions of the target population are comfortable with self-administered web surveys, this approach might be attempted first, followed by interviewer-administered telephone surveys for non-respondents.", "A third mode might also be deployed if needed, with an interviewer traveling to the respondent to administer a face-to-face survey.", "When multiple modes of administration are combined, however, responses may vary across modes of administration.", "For example, participants may be more willing to accurately respond to sensitive questions in self-administered modes than in face-to-face modes (Tourangeau & Smith, 1996).", "Such mode effects may require statistical adjustments (de Leeuw, 2005; Fowler, Jr. et al., 2002) or alternatively, the use of random response techniques (Lensvelt-Mulders, Hox, van der Heijden, & Maas, 2005) to improve response validity", "Measurement Development for Dissemination and Implementation Research", "Researchers are increasingly developing more rigorous methods of measurement development, and taking advantages of technological advances that make better measurement possible and less burdensome on participants.", "Such methods have not yet been widely used in D & I research, but their benefits, particularly as common outcome metrics are developed, suggest significant opportunities for application in this area.", "For example, in surveying agencies in a dissemination/implementation program, the methods described below can be used to customize questions for specific agencies or service users so that provide the most informative information for each unique situation, reduce respondent burden, and avoid the pitfalls of “one size fits all” approaches.", "Classical and IRT measurement methods differ dramatically in approach to administration and scoring. For example, consider a track and field meet in which athletes participate in a hurdles race and in high jump.", "Suppose that the hurdles are not all the same height and the score is determined by the runner’s time and the number of hurdles cleared.", "For the high jump, the cross bar is raised incrementally and athletes try to jump over the bar without dislodging it.", "The first of these two events is like a traditionally scored objective test: runners attempt to clear hurdles of varying heights, analogous to answering questions of varying difficulty.", "In either case, a specific counting operation measures ability to clear hurdles or answer questions. On the high jump, ability is measured by the highest position the athlete clears.", "IRT measurement uses the same logic as the high jump: Items are arranged on a continuum with fixed points of increasing difficulty of endorsement.", "Scores are measured by the location on the continuum of the most difficult item endorsed. In IRT, scores are obtained using a scale point rather than a count.", "These methods of scoring hurdles and high jump, or their analogues in traditional and IRT measures, contrast sharply: If hurdles are arbitrarily added or removed, number of hurdles cleared cannot be compared across races run with different hurdles or different numbers of hurdles.", "Scores lose their comparability if item composition is changed. The same is not true, however, of the high jump or of IRT scoring.", "If one of the positions on the bar were omitted, height cleared is unchanged and only the precision of the measurement at that point on the scale is affected.", "Thus, in IRT scoring, a certain number of items can be arbitrarily added, deleted or replaced without losing comparability of scores, thus reducing participant burden and costs of administration.", "This property of scaled measurement, compared with counts, is the most salient advantage of IRT over classical measurement.", "Computerized adaptive testing (CAT) can be used to develop banks of items for specific populations, with a range of endorsement difficulties (Weiss, 1985), for use in IRT-based outcomes measurement.", "Cognitive interviewing and other qualitative approaches can be used to understand participants’ experiences of endorsement difficulty for particular items, as well as factors associated with difficulty of endorsement.", "Once item banks are available, they can be used to build complex surveys that adapt to individual participants’ characteristics and response patterns (Gibbons et al., 2013).", "While use of CAT and IRT has been widespread in educational measurement, it has been less widely used in D & I research.", "In addition to cognitive interviewing, qualitative methods such focus groups and as concept mapping can be used to inform the item development necessary to use IRT approaches in D & I research.", "Vertical or developmental scaling is an IRT method frequently used in educational assessments to provide a single scale that is applicable across all grade levels so that growth in learning can be measured with a common yardstick (Tong & Kolen, 2007).", "In the measurement of child outcomes following a D & I project, items that may be appropriate for a 14- or 15-year-old may not be appropriate for a 9- or 10- year-old.", "As long as there is a subset of common “anchor” items that can be used for adjacent developmental (age) groups, IRT-based vertical scaling can be used to provide a common assessment across different developmental levels.", "These techniques can be used to deliver lower-cost, less burdensome, outcome measures that can be compared across similar D & I projects.", "Mixed methods approaches to D & I research hold great promise for unpacking the processes and factors that are often hidden within the black boxes that have been the hallmark of evidence-based practice implementation.", "A multitude of qualitative techniques are available to meet the needs of D & I researchers, ranging from traditional ethnographic techniques to rapid ethnographic assessment, and from purely observational techniques to hybrid designs that inherently combine both qualitative and quantitative methods.", "Conventional survey methods have their place as well, but newer technologies, combined with improvements in the underpinnings of measurement theory, make possible a new generation of more valid and less burdensome assessment processes.", "Together, the methods described in this paper provide a set of approaches that could be considered a toolkit for mixed methods D & I research.", "Such a toolkit has particularly important application in multi-level state-related policy research that involves scaling up of evidence-based practices.", "These methods are useful for comparing the different perspectives of the various stakeholders and constituents—ranging from policy-makers to agency directors and management; from front-line clinical staff to patients and families—and for developing clear understandings of implementation successes and failures.", "Mixed methods provide the opportunity to produce enriched understandings of the complexities of implementation processes, and to tap into the nuances of vexing barriers and promising facilitators of implementation.", "Together, they provide necessary methods for improving strategies for effective, efficient, and sustainable roll-outs of evidence-based practices.", "This work was funded by an award from the National Institute of Mental Health (P30-MH090322; K.

But no matter who funds our research — foundations, government, or companies — we apply the same template to our work,” wrote Goldman and Lakdawalla.", "“The ivory tower is not always the best place to understand the social benefits of treatments, the incentives for medical innovation, and how aligning prices with value can aid consumers.”", "Engaging the private sector has indeed boosted Goldman’s income. According to federal conflict of interest forms filed last year, when he served on an advisory panel to the Congressional Budget Office, Goldman earned consulting income from the firm in the range of $25,000 to $200,000, on top of his income as a USC professor.", "He also has more than $500,000 in equity in the firm.

All three founders of Precision Health Economics were listed as authors of the Health Affairs article, alongside one of their employees, yet none of the founders disclosed their ties to their consulting firm in the published study.", "In an interview, Goldman said this might have been an “oversight.”", "Goldman later emailed ProPublica to clarify that the journal was aware that the study was a Precision Health Economics publication and that Goldman and his co-founders were affiliated with the firm.", "Goldman has published more than 25 articles and letters to the editor in Health Affairs since co-founding Precision Health Economics, and only five have listed the connection.", "“This affiliation is clearly not a secret and I include it where relevant,” Goldman wrote in the email.", "“The bottom line is that disclosure policies vary across journals, journal editors, and over time. Definitions of what is ‘relevant’ are also subject to their own judgments.”", "Donald Metz, executive editor of Health Affairs, said the journal followed its policy of leaving disclosure to the “authors’ discretion.”", "Its editorial staff did not exclude any information on conflicts or affiliations that the authors provided alongside their draft, he said.", "As the cancer study gained national recognition, its methodology and findings came under fire. Researchers from Dartmouth College tried and failed to reproduce the results.", "Cancer care in the U.S., their research found, may actually provide less value than cancer care in Europe, considering cost.", "“We know that [the U.S. health care system] is more disorganized and disorganization is more expensive, so it’s surprising to believe that the U.S. would perform better in a cost-effectiveness sense,” said Samir Soneji, one of the authors of the counter-study and an assistant professor of health policy at Dartmouth.", "The science in the original study, Soneji says, was “questionable.”", "Soneji was not alone in his criticism.

Plaintiffs claim that the Board inappropriately limited its scope to potential acquirers who would be able to move quickly in making a competing offer.", "Plaintiffs also decry the market check as unreasonable because the Board failed to contact any private equity buyers even though, as Plaintiffs allege, private equity buyers have been active in the pharmaceutical and clinical research space in recent years.", "In considering these arguments, I find that the scope of the market check was adequate and consistent with the Board's well-informed understanding of the industry and Micromet's needs.", "In instructing Goldman on the types of companies to contact about a potential acquisition, the Board sought those companies that were familiar with Micromet, had indicated an interest in partnering over MT103, and were large enough to undertake a billion dollar transaction.", "Based on the overwhelming importance of MT103 to Micromet's potential and, thus, its valuation, the Board's focus on contacting acquirers that could benefit from and further develop MT103 was reasonable, as those companies would be most likely to be able to make synergistic topping bids for the Company.", "Moreover, six of the seven companies contacted during the market check had engaged in due diligence with Micromet during the partnering process during the fall and two already were engaged in active collaborations with Micromet over other drugs in its pipeline.", "Thus, these companies knew about and were interested in Micromet and presumably understood the potential of MT103 for purposes of any offer they might make.", "For similar reasons, Micromet's decision to eschew contacting any private equity buyers also seems reasonable.", "Micromet's primary business strategy involved collaborating with larger pharmaceutical companies in the commercialization and distribution of its drugs.", "Moreover, Micromet needed not only capital, but technical expertise, to realize the full potential value of its product pipeline.", "In light of these facts and Micromet's near-term negative cash flow projections, the Board reasonably could have concluded that financial buyers would perceive less synergies than a strategic buyer and be less likely to make a topping bid in a billion-dollar deal for the Company.", "Plaintiffs also challenge the timing of the pre-signing market check conducted by the Board as being unreasonably short.", "According to Plaintiffs, the week-long diligence period provided during the market check was insufficient to allow the potential acquirers other than Amgen to conduct a meaningful due diligence process and make a competing bid.", "In contrast, according to Plaintiffs, Amgen had been given months to conduct due diligence on the Company.", "As a result, Plaintiffs contend that the limited market check period provided Amgen with an unfair advantage in securing the deal.", "As an initial matter, Plaintiffs' allegation that Amgen had been given \"access to the Company both in terms of due diligence and negotiations\" for months is overstated.", "Amgen participated in one day-long due diligence session with Micromet in August 2011. In contrast, six of the seven potential acquirers had conducted due diligence on Micromet related to MT103, its lead product, during the fall of 2011 and one of the potential acquirers, Company D, had even completed its due diligence during that time.", "Micromet did not invite Amgen to participate in the MT103 partnering process, so Amgen was not able to conduct due diligence on MT103 until after the January 2 meeting.", "Therefore, Plaintiffs are not likely to succeed in proving that Amgen enjoyed the informational advantages they claim.", "Moreover, based on the prior access that six of the seven potential acquirers had to Micromet immediately before the market check, I do not consider it unreasonable for the Board to have limited the due diligence period to one week.", "Of the three potential acquirers who conducted due diligence during the market check, each was given access to the Company's online data room, as well as to Micromet's management.", "Furthermore, when Company B expressed concerns about being able to complete its due diligence within the given timeframe, Goldman responded that potential acquirers only needed to submit a \"preliminary indication of their interest,\" not a definitive proposal, by the end of the diligence period.", "Likewise, while Company C originally expressed doubt about its ability to conduct sufficient due diligence during that period, the management of Micromet worked to provide Company C with the information it required and Company C responded on January 24, 2012, that although it had \"reviewed all the pertinent facts\" related to Micromet, it was not interested in an acquisition.", "Indeed, every one of the companies contacted during the market check advised Micromet before it signed the Merger Agreement that they were not interested or were unable to reach the valuation range necessary to make a competing offer.", "See Carter Dep. at 85-86 (testifying that Company B decided that it \"could not get into double figures\" in valuing the company; Company C did an \"incomplete analysis because it didn't feel that they could get to the value that they had probably assumed, and [because] it probably didn't fit . . .", "into their portfolio;\" and Company D, at the time, \"was locked away and had been for a week or two with another company\").", "Therefore, based on the Board's prior knowledge of the industry, the other potential acquirers' familiarity with Micromet and its lead product, MT103, and the fact that each of the potential acquirers declined to pursue acquiring the Company for reasons other than the inability to conduct sufficient due diligence in the time allotted, I find that the market check was reasonable.", "As part of the Merger Agreement, the Board agreed to various deal protection measures in favor of Amgen.", "Plaintiffs claim that these protections unreasonably shortened the post-signing market check period and precluded other bidders from emerging and making competing bids.", "In particular, Plaintiffs argue that the no-shop, matching rights, information rights, and change of recommendation provisions in the Merger Agreement effectively imposed a delay of a total of ten business days and potentially fifteen calendar days before the Board could embrace a competing offer and recommend it to shareholders.", "Thus, according to Plaintiffs, these provisions, in conjunction with the other deal protections devices in the Merger Agreement, make it virtually impossible for a competing bidder to make a competing bid for Micromet.", "Among the sources of the problem Plaintiffs perceive are the provisions of § 1.2(c) of the Merger Agreement regarding matching rights and adverse recommendation notice.", "Plaintiffs have failed to show, however, that § 1.2(c) operates in the obstructive manner they allege.", "Parent shall have received from the Company prior written notice of the Company's intention to make an Adverse Change Recommendation at least four (4) business days prior to making any Adverse Change Recommendation . . .", "if the decision to make an Adverse Change Recommendation is in connection with an Acquisition Proposal, then the Company shall comply with clauses (A) through (D) as follows: (A) prior to giving effect to clauses (B) through (D), the Company's Board of Directors shall have determined, in good faith, that such Acquisition Proposal is a Superior Offer, (B) the Company shall have provided to Parent the material terms and conditions of such Acquisition Proposal and copies of all material documents relating to such Acquisition Proposal in accordance with Section 5.4, (C) the Company shall have given Parent four (4) business days after Parent's receipt of the Change of Recommendation Notice to propose revisions to the terms of [the Merger Agreement] or make other proposals and shall have negotiated in good faith with Parent . . .", "with respect to such proposed revisions or other proposals, if any, so that the Acquisition Proposal would no longer constitute a Superior Offer and (D) after considering the results of negotiations with Parent and taking into account proposals made by Parent, if any, after consultation with its outside legal counsel, the Company's Board of Directors shall have determined, in good faith, that such Acquisition Proposal remains a Superior Offer and that the failure to make the Adverse Change Recommendation would constitute a breach of fiduciary duties of the Board . . .", ".\"Superior Offer\" is defined under the Merger Agreement as an unsolicited bid for more than 80% of the voting power of the Company that the Board determines, in its good faith judgment, to be more favorable than the terms of the Amgen offer and reasonably capable of being completed on the terms proposed.", "Under § 1.2(c), if the Board determines that it has received a Superior Offer, it must notify Amgen in a Change of Recommendation Notice of the offer and provide it with all relevant materials relating thereto.", "Amgen is then given four business days to negotiate with Micromet's Board and decide whether to match the Superior Offer, after which the Board must determine whether its fiduciary duties require it to change its recommendation in favor of the new bid.", "Contrary to Plaintiffs' interpretation of this section, the so-called \"blackout\" period for recommendations and the matching rights period are intended to run concurrently.", "If, after the four-day matching rights period, the Board determines to make an Adverse Change Recommendation, it evidently can do so immediately.", "Therefore, the maximum period during which the Board can be restricted from changing its recommendation following notice of receipt of a Superior Offer is shorter than Plaintiffs suggest.", "I also note that if Amgen decides to increase its offer in response to a competing bid, Rule 14e-1 of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 would require that the tender offer period be extended for an additional ten business days.", "Moreover, I disagree with Plaintiffs' characterization of the recommendation provision here as being \"nearly identical\" to the recommendation provision in In re Compellent Technologies, Inc.", "Shareholders Litigation, which Vice Chancellor Laster found to be problematic. The relevant language in Compellent was less clear than in this case and could be read to mean that upon the Board's having determined that it had a fiduciary duty to change its recommendation, it still would have had to wait four business days before satisfying those duties by, e.g., notifying its shareholders.", "Here, however, § 1.2(c) explicitly requires the Board to wait until Amgen has been given the opportunity to respond to a Superior Offer before undertaking to determine whether its fiduciary obligations require the Board to change its recommendation.", "As a result, unlike Compellent, the recommendation provision here does not restrict the Board's ability to fulfill known fiduciary duties in a timely fashion.", "Therefore, the potential problems identified in Compellent do not exist here.", "As to the other deal terms challenged by Plaintiffs, including the exemption of Amgen from the Company's Rights Agreement, these terms appear to be relatively standard and they do not raise serious concerns of preclusion.", "Indeed, as Defendants point out, a similar combination of deal terms, including a no-shop provision, matching and information rights, a termination fee of roughly 3% of equity value, a top-up option, and a poison pill exemption, recently were approved by this Court in In re Orchid Cellmark, Inc. Shareholder Litigation.", "I further note that In re Orchid involved only a slightly longer post-signing period of forty-two days, six more days than the post-signing period in this case.", "For all of these reasons, I find that Plaintiffs have not shown that they are likely to succeed on their claims that the pre-signing market check was unreasonable and the deal protections agreed to under the Merger Agreement, at least collectively, were preclusive.", "Plaintiffs have made numerous disclosure claims in their Complaint and in the briefing. Having read and considered each of those claims, I find that Plaintiffs have not shown a likelihood of success on any of their disclosure claims.", "For the purposes of this Memorandum Opinion, however, I discuss only those claims that were highlighted in the briefing.", "\"The duty of disclosure is a judicially imposed fiduciary duty\" that \"serves the ultimate goal of informed stockholder decision making.\"", "It is not, however, \"a full-blown disclosure regime like the one that exists under federal law.\" The duty is a \"specific application of the general fiduciary duty owed by directors,\" and accordingly, is concomitant with the duty of care, loyalty, or both.", "Thus \"[w]hen stockholder action is requested, directors are required to provide shareholders with all information that is material to the action being requested and 'to provide a balanced, truthful account of all matters disclosed in the communications with shareholders.'\"", "Arnold v.

It is easy to drop in and take a stake in someone’s series A or B round, but today’s life science entrepreneurs expect a lot more.", "They value someone being there with them right from the start, with the incubating support and seed money that builds traction with key stakeholders.", "That full-on kind of assistance works best at close quarters and it is much harder to do it remotely.", "Geography counts – in fact, it is the premise that led Beth and I to launch Westlake Village BioPartners in September 2018 with $320m in committed capital.", "Los Angeles was a natural fit for our mission because both of us have deep roots here. I am a fourth generation native Californian and most recently served as global head of R&D at Amgen Inc., based in Thousand Oaks.", "At Amgen I was frequently asked to advise scientists and entrepreneurs on how to take their discovery work beyond the lab by creating a commercial business.", "I told them that, while the academic infrastructure and talent was abundant, Los Angeles lacked a venture capital presence sufficient enough to attract enough seed money to help a start-up become a functioning pre-revenue biotech.", "It meant that funding usually had to be found outside the area, in places like Boston, and when the IP went back east with the money, the business itself was airlifted out of here as well.", "It was a message I had to convey many, many times. When Beth approached me about leaving her post at Kleiner Perkins in the Bay area to move closer to her home in Thousand Oaks, both of us realized that our collective experience and reputation could be leveraged.", "Together we can fill the business need for a supportive pool of funding dedicated to local innovators here in Los Angeles.", "After 17 years in the R&D business at Amgen, I too was ready for a new challenge. With the creation of Westlake Village BioPartners, we can fill the missing money link in the local life sciences ecosystem, helping entrepreneurs find new places where capital and talent can find a productive home.", "V: How do you define that geography? What has your progress been thus far and were clients", "Harper: Our area of focus is Los Angeles county and the four others surrounding it – Ventura, Orange, Riverside and San Bernardino.", "It constitutes the second largest metro area in the US and has a population of more than 18 million. We have five client companies in contract, all of which are able to benefit from our deep expertise in the local start-up scene.", "There is no magical formula of superior IP: what is coming out of UCLA is not qualitatively better than what you find at MIT or Stanford.", "Instead, I think it is pent up demand, with many new small firms having warehoused ideas that were attractive but still needed some work, so non-local VCs took a pass.", "That is where we see opportunity. We are prepared to advise them of flaws, like not prioritizing crucial tests – the outcome of which might either kill or validate the portfolio.", "We do not mince words. It is a liability if you ignore such tests out of fear it might torpedo the entire project, because capital always avoids uncertainty.", "You must do that killer experiment. If it works out, then your business is effectively de-risked and VC money will flow.", "Giving that kind of advice and developing pitches that work is a lot of what we do now. And the more we dig into the weeds with start-ups, the better we do in uncovering those interesting technologies that haven’t found a sponsor.", "UCLA’s tech transfer office, and those at other local academic institutions, recognize the value of working with us because we see them not on an occasional fly in, but daily, on the ground.", "VC people who come in from Boston or even the Bay area are not going to be able to pursue due diligence with the intensity we can.", "It is also important to recognize that we can bring IP from anywhere and use it to build a great company in the Los Angeles area.", "The technical advice and project oversight we provided over the past two decades in our shared roles as company executive and industry investor differentiates us from most other VC firms.", "We are just doing what we’ve always done, but in a different format. Founders of the start-ups out here are usually talking to advisers who have never worked outside the finance field.", "There is no historical perspective in advising companies in good times – and bad. I am not exaggerating: the end game out here is to take the IP and move the business to the east coast, preferably Boston.", "What Beth and I want to do is capture the IP at Yale University, to use a hypothetical example, and move the business out here, where we can be present and active at the gestation phase and beyond.", "In some cases, a company founder might want to retain a lab relationship at a university outside of the Los Angeles region, but the root and branch enterprise should be here.", "IV: Ken Schultz, CEO of Trethera Inc. and member of In Vivo’s Editorial Advisory Board: Don’t you anticipate some challenges to the model, especially the absence of homegrown expertise in areas like general management, regulatory or contract manufacturing services?", "Are there gaps that will force start-ups to look elsewhere for roots in places with that diversity of talent?", "Harper: The local talent situation is improving. Amgen is working hard to create an ecosystem of biopharma human capital in the Los Angeles region that can match Boston or the Bay area.", "As the most recent head of Amgen R&D, I’d get emails every day from people in the industry who are looking to relocate to the area because of a spouse that has landed a management job in the services sector here, which is as large or larger than other US metro areas; or I went to med school out here but did my post-doc at MIT and want to come back.", "Amgen, for example, has recruited great people from everywhere, in diverse fields related to life sciences in general.", "With time, it has forged a pool of expertise that gets larger every year. At Westlake Village BioPartners, our record so far speaks for itself: five companies started and we’re still rolling.", "IV: Since you have moved to active VC investor from the research lab, what have you witnessed in terms of new science?", "Harper: The trajectory of industry innovation is often one of long fallow periods followed by a spurt of explosive growth.", "This is true of biology. Innovation in human therapeutics was flat for decades but is now producing exponential returns.", "Gene therapy is a great example: it languished and was even abandoned after some bad safety signals in the 1990s but in the last five years it has become a viable treatment path starting with two FDA approved products in 2017.", "Today, there are some 350 companies active in the field, with hundreds of products undergoing clinical trials.", "We are in a new golden age of drug development, paced by computational biology, robotics and so many other technologies that add up to a far more predictable pathway to treatments that actually work in patients.", "It is a far cry from what I thought was possible in human therapeutics a decade ago. What really excites me are all the new technology platforms like human genome sequencing, including the ability to sequence individual tumors as an entry point for precision medicine.", "Computing power brings the capacity to take target discovery and validation beyond the mice models directly to humans.", "That’s a transformative change itself. One of the best things we did at Amgen was to acquire Iceland’s deCODE Genetics, a major source of population-based data that provided us with the information necessary to identify drug targets from large-scale screening of genes associated with many common diseases.", "When we bought deCODE, no one had been able to sequence an entire population – some 300,000 people – in all its genetic diversity to obtain those targets.", "Now we can. In my view, it gives Amgen’s R&D team a deeper understanding of the underlying biology of disease, putting them much closer to finding cures.", "But this is not all. Back when I was a post-doc at MIT, we could spend 10 years solving the crystal structure of a single protein.", "Today, the technology exists to structure the smallest molecule in that protein or to co-crystalize different proteins interacting with each other – an inter-disciplinary feat that bridges the physics of movement with biology.", "And a single company can produce 500 of these in a single year, not a decade. I know that artificial intelligence and machine learning get over-hyped, but these are emerging fields that already show promise in advancing unheard of efficiencies in areas like clinical trials.", "Add this up and you see that science and technology are working together to bend the curve on what’s possible for patients.", "There is vast potential for investors willing to get into the weeds for a closer look.", "IV: With that in mind, in an era where science opportunities are abundant but moving fast, how do you handle the due diligence work that is essential to striking the best deal?", "Harper: No doubt about it – it’s hard, for several reasons. First, the sheer volume of activity out there makes the search for innovation seem like entering a labyrinth with a blindfold on.", "You can look at interesting technology coming from the universities, where claims abound that the next generation of cell-based therapy is about to spring from their labs.", "But good luck in trying to compare the formal academic work with what’s going inside the walls of dozens and dozens of privately-held companies, many of which have been founded by academics, and also have the abundant capitalization to ensure they can operate for years in stealth mode.", "Second, the money flowing into biotech adds an extra measure of uncertainty because it raises the stakes in being able to find a truly innovative, commercially differentiated drug.", "You have to account for the herd mentality – going all-in on cell-based cancer therapies – that raises the bar on success in getting beyond the hype.", "This does not mean due diligence is impossible. VC firms can provide the expert oversight, technical tools and input on how to administer the process.", "The challenge is putting the diligence in context, particularly in those crowded therapeutic fields popular with investors.", "In fact, we believe it falls to old-fashioned intuition in making that crucial distinction of whether an asset opportunity is incremental or potentially transformative.", "What we know is, in an over-capitalized field, a transformative technology – say, CAR-T 2.0 – is going to be the investment that makes a difference in the long game.", "It can’t be a tweak in the current standard of care; and Beth and I do not want to make a play in that space.", "In all honesty, the lack of clarity in assessing commercial prospects in this brave new world of biotech discovery is what keeps me up at night.", "There is no clear line of sight into what all those private companies are doing, though an extra measure of accumulated experience and street smarts can help in making sense of it.", "Schultz: Many of our readers are CEOs or CSOs. You have taken a career path that now seems in vogue, moving from a big pharma firm to a smaller VC or start-up.", "How have you managed that transition and what advice might you offer to our readers?", "Harper: The opportunity set in biopharma has changed significantly. Today is a true golden age in the history of biotechnology.", "Three-quarters of all products in late-stage development come from smaller enterprises relying on venture capital as their principal source of funds.", "Roughly a third of new launches into the marketplace originate from independent biotech firms. The excitement about the innovations coming from the start-up community is real; evidence from the number of FDA novel drug approvals over the past few years indicate this is not a fluke.", "Frankly, as a veteran of R&D in the big established players, I think the start-up culture is hard to replicate.", "Big money and large-scale resources result in people getting too comfortable and losing their edge. It’s one reason why I think all these funding mega-rounds can be dangerous to the scrappy mindset of a start-up because it makes things too comfortable, too complacent.", "You lose the advantage over the people who are working on the same therapeutic target at Pfizer. Too much money and more time means you lose that focused hunger to succeed.", "Bigger still is what I call the sustainability factor that tends to afflict R&D in the biopharma top ten.", "Let’s consider if you are head of R&D in one of these companies five years ago. You’ve studied hard, consulted wide and conclude that the company needs to make a big investment in gene therapy – enough to be a leader in this emerging field.", "Then you stop and realize how many existing priority programs would have to give way to finance this new effort, especially when your board will default to the position that gene therapy investment must come from the existing budget.", "Does that mean you as R&D leader will have to find the funds by halting safety surveillance on a marketed product?", "Powerful internal forces will slow you down because it risks the work they’ve been pursuing for years.", "Building a gene therapy capability within the company becomes a no go. But consider if you took an alternative path and decided to march into the boardroom with a plan to acquire an emerging company – say Spark Therapeutics – along with its potentially transformative lead asset in gene therapy.", "In that scenario, you not only get the money from the balance sheet to purchase the company outright, you’ll also be given the P&L dollars to operate the new acquisition going forward.", "The incentives are aligned to buy the technology, not create it in-house. This is a fairly universal truth in big pharma.", "It’s a long way of explaining that making the transition from a major operational role in big pharma to the boutique VC space is logical because the momentum in innovation is now with smaller companies with a pressing need for financing.", "We are filling a major unmet need in the drug development ecosystem. I don’t see the dependence of big pharma on start-up innovators going away soon.", "IV: Any other learnings from making this transition?", "Harper: Well, the VC model is not perfect either. We now have some people in this field who are unscrupulous, or ignorant or both.", "They end up doing nasty things to entrepreneurs and the founders of start-ups. You also have a growing herd mentality, with money pouring into projects just because others are doing it; there is no detailed analysis or financial metrics, just seeing one high-profile VC doing a deal that others feel they should copy.", "One unhappy result of this is a growing lack of trust between VCs and the start-ups. Today, academics and young, inexperienced entrepreneurs assume that the VC people will take advantage if you don’t map a proper defense – the “only theparanoid survive” perspective.", "It may be a healthy response to a threat, but it makes it harder for me and my partner Beth because we have never operated in a manner that is any way exploitative.", "Reputation is critical to us; we are transparent operators and make sure our clients understand which kind of dilution they will experience over time as fund raising proceeds.", "No surprises that I appraise our co-investment VC partners as closely as the start-up.", "IV: What capabilities are needed to improve trust and raise the talent bar in VC work?", "Harper: There are too few people who combine science and technical know-how with leader behaviors and management savvy.", "It’s also important to understand the mechanics of finance and legal issues, which can be a steep learning curve for newcomers.", "Overall, however, it’s not rocket science. More important than the skill set is the great intangible called experience or intuition: namely, the right scientific package to bet on, and the people necessary to deliver on that bet.", "Such a background is most commonly found among people like me, with years of exposure to details on developing a drug for approval and marketing in a large, diversified organization like Amgen.", "Rarely do such people go into VC. Corporate life gives you structure and is mostly rewarding and comfortable; it is still possible to work till age 65 and then go on to perhaps become an advisor to a VC if not an actual investor.", "Experience can help to differentiate from the current VC situation here in southern California. We see people with no knowledge of the industry sitting on the boards of biotech start-ups, providing seed capital yet knowing little or nothing about drug development.", "They are flush with funds and looking for opportunities to put the money to work. Predictably, the process breaks down, financers get disillusioned and start withdrawing capital.", "Eventually, people like me enter the picture to reverse the decline by restructuring the pipeline, recapitalizing the operation and replacing the board.", "It can get very political. That makes a rescue operation hard work.", "Harper: The cycle begins when a new company obtains the initial series A funding, which is usually only enough to get it halfway to that critical inflection point of demonstrating to investors the value of the enterprise or asset(s).", "No one wants to give the company any more funds; it finds itself dead in the water. So even if we like the technology, we must go out there and convince the founders to restructure, and that often entails convincing them to accept a smaller stake in the enterprise, in return for us making it more valuable over time.", "It’s a hard sell. Very often we just have to walk away. This result is all too prevalent in the Los Angeles region due to the inadequate amounts of capital directed by people without the experience to understand how to succeed in biotech drug development.", "The amount of money being misdirected is really unsettling. It’s the same story – an angel investor who has a nephew with a disease wants to do well for the kid, so he invests in an unproven asset that may cure him yet in doing so actually blocks any hope of commercialization by replicating the blunders I just described.", "It’s like no good deed goes unpunished. I don’t see this in other sectors outside life sciences where the VC community keeps investing in assets or technologies it doesn’t understand.", "IV: Intuition – that feeling from the gut -- seems to be fundamental to your own investment value proposition.", "Harper: It is. But where does the intuition come from? It is experience stemming from pattern recognition; seeing hundreds of programs that have failed for any number or reasons.", "It’s like saying “I’ve seen this movie before and it doesn’t end well.”", "Schultz: You have spoken a lot about the importance of the product asset – the biologic compound or diagnostic.", "How much do you look at the composition and quality of the human capital – the team?", "Harper: This is hugely important. We can embrace multiple models of human capital after we determine the quality of the overall team is first rate.", "If it’s an experienced team, with a track record of doing something well in the past, and we know them and find them trustworthy, we will invest in them.", "Or we will invest on the word of a single CEO because of the trust factor. In both scenarios, they can go look for new technologies and be assured of our total support, at a level beyond the actual funding.", "Schultz: Which has the better chance: a great team and a bad drug, or a bad team and a great drug?", "Harper: Both scenarios are bad because, if you wish to succeed, neither one can trump the other. My view is great technology is the consequence of having the right people in place.", "Projects come and go, but if you don’t have a strong rooted culture of human capital those great results are difficult to sustain.", "Think of what happens when you pursue a technology at all costs and make the people expendable. Nothing very good.", "It follows as well that its critical to match the right people to roles in the organization. A talented person in the wrong post can be disastrous, especially in a team situation.", "A classic example is a chief science officer who excels in that position who aspires to the CEO title even though he has a reputation for endlessly pondering the evidence when making a decision.", "Clearly, if you install that person at the top there is going to be no end of pain. The genius is in convincing that CSO to stay and do what he or she does best.", "This is where a good VC partner adds value – delivering that prescient judgment call on people. Knowing many of them already, like Beth and I do, is an obvious help.", "IV: What will Westlake Village BioPartners look like a year from now?", "Harper: One year in, we are moving forward on a lot of fronts. Our plan is simple – keep building on our unique geographic business model to expand our portfolio of quality investments in great new science.", "You can expect to see an evolution toward a commercial presence in each of the five companies we have invested in to date.", "Of course, in some cases the technology will not work as planned so we will need to adapt and put in place a plan", "B. Nevertheless, we do not anticipate any of our companies failing outright. The technology may falter, the CEO may not work out, and people will have to be reassigned or replaced.", "But Beth and I have embraced a model that we think will make our investments successful in innovating to improve the state of care for patients.", "It’s so challenging to create these innovative start-ups in the first place that it’s folly not to be able to make that mid-course correction to plan B when plan A is demonstrably not working.", "We refuse to opt for the easy route of just injecting more money into the same approach. We adhere to that thesis 100%.", "I expect you will see continued maturation of our companies toward commercialization of their many promising assets.", "The performance metric is this: in this interview, we are talking about our VC, Westlake Village BioPartners.", "A year from now the conversation will be about our companies. We may be in stealth mode about our investments right now, but the time is coming when our companies will hold center stage.", "IV: Is a second funding round for Westlake expected soon?", "Harper: Not yet. We have raised an initial tranche of $320m, which gives us the resources to start 10 to 12 companies.", "We are gaining on that objective right now with our opportunities squarely focused on the Los Angeles environs, cementing Westlake Village BioPartner’s unique geography-centric business model.", "It’s enough to make us a catalyst in tagging Los Angeles as the newest global biotech ecosystem. As other VC start-ups follow, we do intend to initiate a second funding round of similar size, putting 10 to 15 more companies on the metro area map.", "IV: We are close to the start of a new decade for the biotech industry. US private venture-backed companies are on track this year to raise around $150bn.", "Is the VC market ready for a big correction? If so, how will this influence prospects for biotech start-ups and the options they have in going it alone as emerging growth companies?", "Harper: There will continue to be significant investments in biotechnology. We see a convergence of three factors that will be driving early-stage investments.", "First, the speed of technological progress is increasing in a non-linear fashion while costs are coming down, thanks to enablers like artificial intelligence and automation.", "Second, we are gaining new insights into understanding human biology that we never had before. Third, we have more tools to interdict disease pathways.", "We can now engineer more than a dozen different molecules or modalities to influence biological targets.", "So, our efforts in the lab are more precise and laser-focused. Regenerative cell therapies, nanoparticle delivery systems, gene-based therapies, viruses, CAR-T cells and nucleic acid are just some of the examples of new modalities that can overcome previously impenetrable barriers to treating disease."]}

A fair assessment of new migraine preventive treatments is incredibly important to patients, and needs to be framed carefully based on the unique patient experience, disease burden, and impact to society.", "Based on our review of ICER’s draft scope, our recommendations are as follows:", "1) Employ a patient-centered approach – the base-case should be the patient and employer perspective that factors in the missed work days and reduced productivity of migraine patients, as opposed to a payer perspective.", "2) Assess erenumab only in treatment-experienced patients – those who have tried and failed topiramate or propranolol as opposed to treatment-naïve patients.", "3) Factor in treatment discontinuation rates with currently available preventives in the analysis and in the impact on efficacy.", "4) Incorporate responder rates i.e., a fifty percent responder rate assesses the proportion of patients who saw their migraine days reduced by half or more.", "5) Apply full continuous modelling techniques rather than a fixed health state model to more accurately capture the complexities of migraine burden and treatment benefit.", "A more comprehensive discussion of these recommendations is below.", "ICER’s healthcare system perspective should not just reflect the payer perspective but be inclusive of all those who are incurring costs due to migraine, most notably the patient and employer.", "The adoption of a payer perspective, as opposed to a broader societal perspective, is at odds with established accepted methodologies in the economic evaluation of new treatments.1,2,3,4 The gold standard for health economic assessment methodology, the Second Panel on Cost-Effectiveness in Health and Medicine, recommends that all cost-effective analyses capture both the healthcare payer and the societal perspective (in this case, societal is defined as all costs incurred by society due to migraine, including the often overlooked costs to patients).5,6 These include, for example, patient co-payments for treatment, employer costs, and providers costs of services and transactions not covered by insurance.", "Moreover, there are higher overall total costs associated with this debilitating disease that impact the healthcare system including the impact on patient physical, psychological and social lives which are not captured in an assessment that is only payer centric.", "Patients with migraine have much higher average healthcare expenditures averaging 1.5 times matched controls.7 While these are high costs to the healthcare system, they are unlikely to be captured in ICER’s base-case.", "ICER’s current base-case leaves out one of the largest healthcare payers of migraine costs, the self-insured employer.", "Self-insured plans cover 83% of all employees at private sector companies with >200 employees.8 Each employee with frequent migraine costs employers as much as $13,000, a hidden cost representing nearly three times what individuals pay in insurance premiums.9,10,11 ICER should define the healthcare perspective as greater than the payer to be inclusive of all stakeholders (e.g., patients and employers): this more comprehensive approach will more accurately capture the full value of CGRP’s to patients.", "Failure to include a broader perspective may inadvertently lead to migraine being deprioritized over conditions that incur significant payer costs.", "Health economists have recommended this broader perspective for over 20 years12 to ensure that untreated conditions that incur very little comparative cost to payers are not deprioritized.", "Migraine qualifies as one of these as it is 1) extremely debilitating if left untreated 2) incurs little directly identifiable cost to the payer if left untreated and 3) may be more expensive to payers when effectively treated.", "Economists recognize that health as a merit good has benefits that go beyond the healthcare system that methodologically should be reflected in any economic evaluation, including migraine.13", "The use of a payer perspective as the base-case is biased against a fair evaluation of therapies to prevent migraines (such as CGRPs) as it fails to capture more than half of the value to patients.", "As emphasized in the Amgen open comment period response, on top of the non-payer incurred direct medical costs, there are also substantial costs that lie outside of the healthcare system.", "Highly debilitating, migraine causes sufferers to frequently miss work and be less productive while at work, costing employers, patients and society billions of dollars per year.14,15 Absenteeism accounts for 81%, short term disability 13%, and workers compensation 6% of costs from lost productivity due to migraine.16,17,18,19,20 ICER should use a broader healthcare system perspective, inclusive of the patient and employer, as their base-case.", "Additionally, we urge ICER to make all inputs, assumptions and data available and fully transparent –especially in the event that ICER chooses to run this as a separate scenario instead of a base-case.", "Erenumab should not be assessed in populations who are naïve to migraine preventive treatment. Patients that can gain disease control from currently available preventive treatments and who can persist on them, represents maximum value to both the patients and the healthcare system.", "Multiple clinical and insurer sources suggest that in clinical practice, erenumab will be used after failure of topiramate or propranolol, addressing the high unmet need of migraine patients who have experienced a lack of efficacy or tolerability from prior preventives.21,22,23,24,25 Further, in the U.S. ICER CTAF 2014 report, Botox® is reserved for CM patients who have failed topiramate or propranolol.26 In the U.S., this reinforces the place of CGRPs in preventive treatment-experienced patients.", "Moreover, while ICER recommends topiramate and propranolol, the evidence on these interventions is not directly comparable to the evidence on erenumab.", "Studies are not comparable in terms of population, definition of endpoints and other study design elements, which weakens the comparative efficacy estimation.27,28,29,30", "Erenumab has been shown to benefit treatment experienced patient populations including those who have failed prior treatment (including topiramate and propranolol).", "Erenumab is an investigational migraine preventive that has demonstrated sustained efficacy specifically in these patients in clinical trials.31,32 It is of paramount importance that ICER’s assessment address the unmet needs of patients who have not benefited from currently available preventive treatments.", "If ICER were to assess erenumab in all patients, this is not aligned with how these treatments are expected to be used in real world practice.", "It may inadvertently restrict access in patients who will benefit the most and undermine the potential value of these innovative treatments.", "There are several ways to model the economics of migraine prevention with CGRPS. In treatment experienced patients, one way is to model all patients with > 4 migraines days per month.", "In this case, the appropriate comparator for erenumab in the patient populations who have tried and failed topiramate or propranolol is ‘no preventive treatment’.", "Based on ICER’s prior report on Chronic Migraine, ICER may choose to model EM and CM separately, in which case based on ICER’s prior analysis, Botox in CM may be the comparator for the CM population.", "What is known, is that there is currently no defined standard of care for patients with > 4 migraines per month who have tried and failed topiramate or propranolol.", "Additionally, there are no clinical trials or observational cohort data that are available or published with propranolol33 or topiramate 34,35,36,37,38,39 in patients who have tried and failed these treatments.", "As such, neither topiramate nor propranolol are appropriate comparators in preventive treatment experienced patients with 4 or more migraine days per month.", "An adequate therapeutic trial with preventive therapy is approximately 2-3 months based on treatment guidelines for prevention.40,41 Requiring failure of multiple classes of therapies for 18-24 months is overly burdensome to patients and is not supported by available evidence.42,43,44 Treatment guidelines, published sources, real-world and clinical practice data do not to support this approach.45 The time a patient tries a treatment can be short, reflected in persistence rates.", "Annual persistence rates with current preventive therapies is low: 50% of patients discontinue treatment at one month, 70-75% by month 6.46 In another study, similar trends were observed at month 12.47 Given that there are no data in a robust controlled setting or in current clinical practice that support a treatment paradigm of patients requiring failure of multiple classes, ICER should evaluate erenumab in migraine patients after failure of topiramate or propranolol with an adequate therapeutic trial.", "Discontinuation rates and poor adherence must be accurately captured since patients can only derive continued benefit when they persist with therapy.", "Adherence is a fundamental driver of value.48,49 Despite discontinuation of preventive migraine medications, acute medication use persists.50 While acute medication use is observed to decrease in the 30 days after discontinuation of the index preventive, acute medication use rebounds to pre-preventive usage in the 31-90 days after discontinuation.51 ICER should ensure that they accurately account for and measure discontinuation rates in all treatments as they have a significant impact on efficacy in clinical practice.", "Failure to capture this accurately would significantly underestimate the value of CGRPs.", "Per guidelines, RR is a key measure of preventive treatment success.52 Odds ratio (OR) and confidence interval (CI) relative to placebo, in all comers for erenumab 140-mg in EM was 2.81 (2.01 to 3.94) 53 and in CM 2.3 (1.6, 3.5).", "54 In treatment experienced patients with >1 prior treatment failures, OR relative to placebo, in EM was 3.06 (1.70, 5.52) 55 and in CM was 3.30 (1.98, 5.51)56, nominal p<0.001.", "ICER should reflect RR as an important outcome measure since it accurately captures a with-in patient response.", "In a study comparing the modeling of migraine preventives using a health state approach versus a continuous approach, parametric continuous distributions provide more accurate approximations of migraine day frequency.57 ICER should use a continuous distribution approach rather than a “health state” approach to more accurately capture migraine day frequency.", "The migraine prevention space has had no real innovation in two decades and patients are in need of new treatment options.", "As ICER has accurately reflected, migraine is one of the most debilitating diseases in the world. Its profound effects, which impact every facet of patients’ lives, are frequently underestimated.", "Current preventive treatment options are suboptimal for many patients. We recommend that ICER focus on areas where CGRPs are more likely to be used in real world clinical practice: those migraine patients that do not have available treatments that work.", "Moreover, ICER should ensure that its assessment of value is inclusive of all stakeholders, not just healthcare payers, by incorporating a more comprehensive healthcare system and societal perspective in order to capture migraine costs that CGRPs could alleviate.", "At this time, we are also providing a supplemental data appendix with further data to support our comments here.", "- Cost-Effectiveness in Health and Medicine.

Amgen—Biosimilars at the Supreme Court—Oral Argument", "All nine Supreme Court Justices heard argument on Wednesday, April 26, in Sandoz Inc., v. Amgen Inc. The Supreme Court is reviewing interpretations of the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act (“BPCIA”)[1] made by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit.[2] Wednesday’s arguments focused on four main issues: (1) whether the Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) could preliminarily grant licensure prior to the expiration of the 12 year statutory period; (2) whether the notice of commercial marketing requires official licensure to be made; (3) whether the “patent dance” [3] was required by the BPCIA; and (4) whether state law could be used to enforce compliance with the “patent dance” elements of the BPCIA.", "Industry watchers hope that the Supreme Court will streamline the process for getting biosimilars to market by providing increased certainty.", "The BPCIA, included in the Affordable Care Act, was intended to create an FDA approval pathway for generic versions of biologic drugs similar to the pathway provided by the Hatch-Waxman Act for small molecule drugs.", "The present controversy is based on Sandoz Inc. (“Sandoz”) seeking FDA approval for a generic version of Amgen’s filgrastim drug Neupogen under the BPCIA.", "At its heart, the controversy stems from the interpretation of the word “shall” and of a notice requirement in 42 U.S.C. § 262 (k) and (l).", "A judge in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California ruled in Sandoz’s favor that (1) providing Amgen with a copy of its abbreviated Biologics License Application was not required under § 262(l)(2)(A), and (2) that Sandoz’s notice of commercial marketing provided to Amgen before the FDA had approved Sandoz’s application was sufficient notice under § 262(l)(8)(A).[4]", "The Federal Circuit ruled that a biosimilar applicant must provide a notice of commercial marketing to the reference product sponsor (“sponsor”) after the biosimilar application is approved, and cannot market the biosimilar for 180 days after providing the notice.", "The Federal Circuit also ruled that a biosimilar applicant need not provide a copy of its application or manufacturing information to the sponsor under section 262(l)(2)(A), and engage in the “patent dance;” if the biosimilar applicant does not provide this information, the sponsor may only bring a patent infringement litigation or a declaratory judgment action.[5]", "The Supreme Court granted Sandoz’s petition for a writ of certiorari[6] to address: (1) “whether notice of commercial marketing given before [U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”)]", "approval can be effective;” and (2) “whether, in any event, treating [42 U.S.C. § 262(l)(8)(A)] as a stand-alone requirement and creating an injunctive remedy that delays all biosimilars by 180 days after approval is improper.”[7]", "The Court also granted Amgen’s cross-petition to address (3) whether an applicant is required “to provide the [s]ponsor with a copy of its biologics license application and related manufacturing information” pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 262(l)(2)(A) and where an applicant fails to provide such information, “is the [s]ponsor’s sole recourse to commence a declaratory judgment action . . .", "During argument, the parties generally agreed that the FDA cannot approve a biologics license application for a biosimilar until the 12 year statutory period under the BPCIA has elapsed.", "However, Sandoz argued that FDA approval is not required before an applicant can provide the sponsor notice of commercial marketing under the BPCIA.", "Sandoz contended that FDA approval is not a prerequisite because biosimilars are close enough to their reference product that a general notice of intent to market a biosimilar provides a good-faith basis for alleging patent infringement and meets the statutory requirements for a lawsuit.", "In contrast, Amgen argued that infringement does not occur until an FDA license has been granted at the 12-year mark because the FDA may require changes to the biosimilar manufacturing process that affect whether a patent covers the biosimilar product or manufacturing process.", "In addition, Amgen argued that the “patent dance” provisions of the BPCIA are mandatory. In contrast, Sandoz and the United States as amicus curiae contend (under differing theories) that information sharing is not mandatory because the BPCIA grants patent holders a cause of action to sue for declaratory judgment if any of the information sharing provisions are violated.", "Justices Gorsuch, Roberts, and Sotomayor asked questions about the preemption of state law. Sandoz argued that there is no state law issue on appeal since the only judgments are based on federal law and thus only the federal judgment is on appeal.", "The United States argued that because the “patent dance” is optional under the statute, opting out of the patent dance would not be a violation of federal law.", "Thus, a state law case to enforce the patent dance would be moot, since there can be no equitable state law remedy to enforce an optional federal law provision.", "Amgen, in contrast, argued that the “patent dance” is mandatory, and therefore, it can be enforced under state law based on Bates v. Dow Agroscience.[12] Justices Sotomayor, Breyer, Roberts, and Gorsuch expressed reservations about allowing different states to apply their own, potentially differing rules to enforce the “patent dance” provisions.", "Sandoz and Amgen agreed that FDA licensure cannot be officially granted under the statute before the 12 year statutory time period has expired.[9] The parties disagreed, however, on whether the FDA can grant conditional approval of a biologics license application before the 12-year period expired.", "Sandoz asserted that the BPCIA does not allow the FDA to grant tentative approval of a biosimilar drug before the 12 year exclusivity period expires.", "Amgen argued that the FDA may grant a conditional license only effective after the 12 years have elapsed, but noted that the 12-year period had expired long ago in this case, and is not an issue here.", "The parties contested whether the biosimilar applicant can serve the notice of commercial marketing only after FDA approval.", "Sandoz argued that notice can be provided as soon as an application to the FDA is filed, since application evinces an intent to market a product biosimilar to the sponsor’s reference product.", "Sandoz’s proposed interpretation avoids adding any time to the statutory 12 year exclusivity period. Justices Breyer, Roberts, Kagan, Kennedy, and Sotomayor each expressed incredulity that effective notice of commercial marketing could be given to a sponsor without final FDA approval.", "Those Justices noted that such a notice may not include the final manufacturing process, the final biosimilar product, or both.", "Sandoz responded that biosimilars are similar enough to sponsor products that a sponsor may always bring a good faith lawsuit alleging that the proposed biosimilar infringes the primary patents covering the sponsor’s drug.", "In addition, Sandoz argued that many steps in the “patent dance” are required to be performed in order, but the notice of commercial marketing is not, indicating that the notice may be given earlier in the process.", "During argument, Justice Breyer, Chief Justice Roberts, and Justice Ginsburg each suggested that the timing of the notice need not be resolved now, and should be addressed after the FDA goes through the rulemaking process.", "Amgen reasoned that the applicant must provide the notice of commercial marketing after approval because the 180-day period following the notice of commercial marketing is designed to focus patent litigation on the final, approved application for a biosimilar, and not an unapproved application that may change.", "Amgen argued that before final approval, there is no imminent harm of an impending biosimilar launch, so a district court would be unwilling to enjoin the marketing of a biosimilar.", "Amgen also argued that litigation occurring years before FDA approval of the biosimilar would likely result in another round of litigation after approval.", "The early litigation may be based on a manufacturing process or product that is vastly different from what the FDA actually approves, which might require a second round of litigation once the biosimilar nears approval.", "Moreover, Amgen argued that patent applications pending in the United States Patent and Trademark Office (“USPTO”) may issue after the initial round of litigation and require more litigation after approval.", "Sandoz and the United States argued that the “patent dance” is not required. Instead, it is one of two options under the BPCIA for initiating a patent litigation over a biosimilar.", "The other option is a declaratory judgment action by the sponsor.[10] The sponsor is incentivized to sue because if it does not, it will be unable to seek injunctive relief or any damages other than a reasonable royalty.[11]", "The biosimilar applicant is incentivized to participate in the “patent dance” to limit the scope of litigation before the litigation starts.", "Amgen argued that the “patent dance” is required based on the plain meaning of the word “shall” as opposed to the word “may” also used in the statute, and that the “patent dance” is enforceable by injunction under state law.", "Justices Kagan, Roberts, and Sotomayor expressed reservations about a ruling that the “patent dance” is optional because the result would be a lawsuit filed before the parties (and the district courts) know the precise scope of the alleged infringement.", "With multiple issues in front of the Court, it remains to be seen whether the Court will limit its decision to fewer than all of the issues presented, or will go out of its way to clarify the BPCIA.", "K&L Gates will continue to monitor this case and provide updates regarding developments.", "[2] Amgen Inc. v.

(July 2024) |", "deCODE genetics (Icelandic: Íslensk erfðagreining) is a biopharmaceutical company based in Reykjavík, Iceland.", "The company was founded in 1996 by Kári Stefánsson[1] with the aim of using population genetics studies to identify variations in the human genome associated with common diseases, and to apply these discoveries \"to develop novel methods to identify, treat and prevent diseases.", "As of 2019, more than two-thirds of the adult population of Iceland was participating in the company's research efforts,[3] and this \"population approach\" serves as a model for large-scale precision medicine and national genome projects around the world.[4] deCODE is probably best known for its discoveries in human genetics, published in major scientific journals and widely reported in the international media.", "But it has also made pioneering contributions to the realization of precision medicine more broadly, through public engagement in large-scale scientific research; the development of DNA-based disease risk testing for individuals and across health systems; and new models of private sector participation and partnership in basic science and public health.[5]", "Since 2012, it has been an independent subsidiary of Amgen and its capabilities and discoveries have been used directly in the discovery and development of novel drugs.", "This example has helped to spur investment in genomics and precision therapeutics by other pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies.[6]", "[edit]In 1996, when Stefansson left a tenured position at Harvard Medical School to return to Iceland to found a genomics enterprise, nearly everything in his thinking was unproven or controversial.", "At the time, the causes of some rare diseases - often variations in single genes that could be found by studying small families - were beginning to be uncovered.[7]", "Yet it was far from universally accepted that there was any significant genetic component to common/complex diseases like heart disease or type 2 diabetes with well-known behavioral and environmental risk factors; nor, even if there were, whether such variations could be found given the rudimentary technology for reading DNA.[8]", "Stefansson was convinced that these existed and could be identified, but only by working at industrial scale.", "A decade before the term was in common use, deCODE's premise was that this was a big data problem: finding variants impacting risk in dynamic interaction with lifestyle and other factors would require studies not at the family level, but at the scale of public health.", "As a discovery venture in uncharted territory, the strategy was to assemble and query as much data as possible: DNA contributed by tens of thousands of people; both broad and deep medical and health data; and, crucially, comprehensive genealogies linking all these participants together.[9] In short, this required a population, with people willing to take part in research, a modern healthcare system with meaningful numbers of cases of most common diseases, and much genealogical data.", "Iceland, Stefansson's native country, with 270,000 people at the time, fit this description better than any other.[10]", "In 1996, funded by $12 million in American venture capital, deCODE set up a laboratory and began operations.[11]", "Within its first few years it recruited and genotyped tens of thousands of participants. It made rapid progress in creating a national genealogy database; developed a novel privacy protection system with government-supervised identity encryption; signed a landmark partnership with Swiss pharmaceutical company Roche; and mapped putative disease genes in a handful of conditions.[12]", "At the same time as it was beginning to prove its science, the company ignited a huge controversy with the proposal to create a research database - the Iceland Health Sector Database (or IHD for short) - containing copies of medical records from across the country's national health service.[13] In December 1998, with lobbying from deCODE, the Icelandic Parliament passed the Act on Health Sector Database which permitted public bidding for the right of a company to create this health database and use it for commercial research and to support the national health system.[14]", "The parliament shortly thereafter granted deCODE the right to create this database after the company made a successful bid to do so.[15] Widely supported by the public and parliament, the IHD's openly commercial aims, and proposed inclusion of medical records data unless individuals opted out, unleashed vehement opposition played out in the local and international media, led by a group of Icelandic activists as well as a number of foreign bioethicists.[16]", "Although the IHD was never built, the debate underscored the political challenges involved in enlisting an entire society in a scientific enterprise, especially one with the explicit aim of commercializing its discoveries.[17] It also ensured that deCODE and its approach went from being a peripheral curiosity to one of the highest profile enterprises in the global effort to understand the human genome.[18]", "[edit]By the time Bill Clinton and Tony Blair announced the completion of the first rough draft of the human genome sequence in June 2000,[19] deCODE was busily scaling up its gene-hunting in dozens of diseases and publishing its first discoveries.[20]", "The company used the most scalable DNA-reading technology of the time - microsatellite genotyping - to place and measure highly variable and therefore informative markers at hundreds of points along the genome.", "Analyzed in tandem with the genealogies, this made it possible to home in on regions of specific chromosomes that people with a given disease tended to have inherited from their common ancestors.[21]", "Harbored within these regions, the thinking went, were genes or sequence variants associated with disease that could subsequently be found using finer-definition methods and tools.[22]", "But the main significance of these early publications was the focus on analytics and the suggestive power of the approach.", "Much of the field and public attention was focused on the race between the publicly funded Human Genome Project (HGP) and the private company Celera to generate the complete sequence of a single whole genome to use as a reference for future research.", "This was a technical challenge to generate and assemble raw data. By contrast, deCODE was advancing a strategy for analyzing variation in tens of thousands of genomes through genetics, leveraging the nature of the genome as a means of replicating and transmitting information.", "The power of the genetics was on full view by 2002, when deCODE published a genetic map of the genome consisting of 5000 microsatellite markers, which the genealogies made it possible to order correctly across all the chromosomes.", "The map was critical to correcting and completing the public reference genome sequence in 2003, improving the accuracy of the HGP assembly from 93% to 99%.[23]", "One key to this approach has been mass participation. From its early days, over 90% of people asked to participate in deCODE's disease research have agreed to do so.[24]", "Participation is voluntary but not trivial. It requires going to a data collection center to have blood drawn, answer questionnaires, and undergo clinical examinations and tests relevant to a given disease.[25]", "By 2003, more than 100,000 people had volunteered to take part in one or more of deCODE's three-dozen common diseases research programs.[26] This number rose to 130,000 by 2007,[27] and more than 160,000 by 2018.", "This represents two-thirds of all adult citizens. The genomes of some 60,000 of these participants had been directly sequenced by 2019, with thousands more being sequenced every month.[28]", "A second and unique pillar of deCODE's work is the genealogies. Geneticist Mary Claire King, whose family-based research in the early 1990s led to the discovery of the BRCA1 and BRCA2 breast cancer genes, predicted not long after deCODE's founding that the ability \"to trace the genealogy of an entire nation...could become one of the treasures of modern medicine.", "\"[29] In 1997, deCODE formed a partnership with local software firm Fridrik Skulason ehf to accelerate the creation of a comprehensive, computerized national genealogy database.", "It drew on all available sources, from the earliest calfskin records and sagas through the 1703 census and parish records to the contemporary national registry.[30]", "By the early 2000s they had created what is still today the most comprehensive genealogy of an entire country.", "It links together all living citizens through virtually complete records back to 1703 (itself recognized by UNESCO as the world's first nominal national census) and stretches back to before the settlement of the country in the ninth century.", "In the research version of the database, the identities of individuals are encrypted via the same anonymization system used for DNA and medical data, so that the data can be correlated.[31]", "And In 2003, deCODE launched a public-facing, online version of the database, called Íslendingabók, or the Book of Icelanders.", "Anyone with an Icelandic social security number could request a password and then research their family tree and see their nearest family connection to anyone else in the country.", "Within its first month online, more than one-third of the population had requested a password.[32] By 2020, it had over 200,000 registered users and more than 900,000 linked entries, comprising the majority of Icelanders who have ever lived.", "On an average day, nearly 6000 people, or close to two percent of all citizens, consult the database.[33]", "In a country that is essentially a huge extended family with a correspondingly keen interest in how its members are related, Islendingabok has become a constant in national life and a daily and direct means of social engagement with deCODE's work.", "But in scientific terms, the ability to understand the precise genealogical relationships of all participants in its research projects has given deCODE an abiding advantage as a discovery enterprise, ensuring that its genomic and medical datasets have remained among the largest and best powered collections anywhere.[34]", "At each successive advance in technology for reading DNA the genealogies have amplified both the amount of data that can be generated from them as well as the power to extract information from the data.[35]", "In the era of microsatellites, it was possible to establish that participants shared certain markers and segments of the genome not by chance but by descent.", "With the advent in the mid-2000s of genotyping chips, which could measure hundreds of thousands of single-letter variations (SNPs) across the genome, deCODE statisticians were able to accurately phase segments of the genome - to understand the parental source of segments - and then impute genotypes measured in some people across the entire population.[36]", "This effectively multiplies the size and power of any study. When Illumina began selling machines that could economically sequence whole genomes, deCODE was able to directly sequence several thousand Icelanders and then impute whole genome sequence (WGS) data for virtually the entire population.", "This represents one of the largest single collections of WGS data in the world, and the first results of its analysis were published in 2015 in a special edition of Nature Genetics.[37]", "The direct sequencing of tens of thousands of more people since then has enabled routine searches for ever rarer variants at an unprecedented scale.[38]", "[edit]Genome research in general, and deCODE's global reputation as a discovery organization, took off with the arrival of SNP genotyping chips in the mid-2000s.[39] These tools set off a worldwide boom in genome-wide association studies (GWAS), in which the entire genome is scanned to identify SNPs that those with a given disease tend to have one version of, while unaffected individuals tend to have another.", "In common diseases, as with many traits or phenotypes such as drug response, the difference is not one of causal certainty but of statistical odds representing increased or decreased risk versus the population average.", "The ability to conduct large studies and analyze the resulting data - from thousands of patients with a disease and many times more control subjects, ideally unaffected relatives - is therefore at a premium.[40]", "deCODE's vast collection of DNA, medical and genealogical data that could be mined together - and enriched through repeated querying and imputation - was almost perfectly suited to this type of study.", "Since 2003, the company has discovered and published hundreds of variants linked to susceptibility to scores of diseases and conditions, including major ongoing contributions to understanding inherited risk for Alzheimer's disease, schizophrenia and other psychiatric disorders; a dozen common forms of cancer; coronary artery disease, stroke atrial fibrillation and the other most common cardiovascular diseases; as well as traits and phenotypes ranging from drug response to cognition and hair and eye color.[41]", "The company publishes its discoveries in peer-reviewed journals, and many, such as the TCF7L2 variants in type 2 diabetes, are used as standard risk markers in polygenic risk modeling and in research.[42]", "A review of the GWAS era published in Nature Communications in 2019 quantified deCODE's outsized contribution to the field: Icelanders accounted for 12% of all participants in all published GWAS studies globally between 2007 and 2017, with each citizen participating on average to 19 published findings in that period alone.[43] Stefansson, deCODE's research chief Unnur Thorsteinsdottir, and statistician Gudmar Thorleifsson were respectively ranked the first-, second- and sixth-highest impact GWAS authors in the world.[44]", "Adding whole-genome sequencing (WGS) on top of its genotyping data gave a new dimension and power to deCODE's discovery capabilities.", "By definition, the common SNPs on standard genotyping chips yielded reliable risk markers but not a determinant foothold in the biology of complex diseases.", "Yet by running the company's growing number of directly sequenced whole genomes through the genotyping data and genealogies as a scaffold, the company's statisticians have been able to impute very high definition WGS on the entire population.", "The result has been the ability to conduct GWAS studies using from 20 to 50 million variants, and to systematically search for rare variants that either cause or confer very high risk of extreme versions of common phenotypes, and thereby pointing directly to putative drug targets.[45]", "The value of this approach is best known from the model of PCSK9, in which the study of families with extremely high cholesterol levels and early-onset heart disease led to an understanding of the key role of this gene and the development of a new class of cholesterol-fighting drugs.", "deCODE now routinely searches for such rare variants across many phenotypes and the results have provided the basis of drug discovery and development programs.[46]", "For example, since 2016 its important contributions in cardiovascular disease include demonstrating that it is non-HDL cholesterol rather than merely LDL levels that most accurately reflect risk of heart disease;[47] finding variants in the ASGR1 gene that protect against coronary artery disease;[48] and defining the role of lipoprotein (a) as a major risk factor for heart attack.[49]", "As all deCODE's data sits on its servers and can be queried simultaneously, it can also be queried with remarkable speed.", "In 2014, a group from the Broad Institute stopped by at deCODE on its way back from Finland, where through a major research effort they had found a variant that protected carriers against type 2 diabetes.", "Over coffee, the deCODE team confirmed that the Finnish variant did not exist in Iceland, but that another did.[50]", "The Broad group added it to the paper announcing the discovery.[51]", "Because of its singular population resources and the questions its scientists can ask and answer, many of deCODE's most remarkable findings have been in basic science.", "One notable focus has been on elucidating how variation in the sequence of the genome is generated. Following its microsatellite-based genetic map of the genome in 2002, the company created and made available to the scientific community two more: one in 2010 built on 300,000 SNPs,[52] and another in 2019 built on WGS data.[53] Recombination - the reshuffling of chromosomes that takes place in the making of eggs and sperm - is a primary mechanism for generating diversity and to build these maps.", "Over fifteen years deCODE has published a series of breakthrough papers detailing in a real human population how recombination rate varies according to sex, age and other characteristics, and how these differences impact the generation of genomic diversity and variation of many kinds.", "The general picture that has emerged is that the genome is generating diversity but within certain bounds, providing a dynamic but generally stable substrate for natural selection and evolution.[54]", "To understand the population that it is working in and to address broader questions few can in the same way, deCODE has also from its early days had its own genetic anthropology group.", "It has published pioneering work on mitochondrial and Y-chromosome mutation to trace the Norwegian and Celtic mix in the early population; sequenced ancient DNA from the settlement period; compared ancient and modern Icelandic genomes to see how genetic drift, epidemics and natural disasters have yielded a modern-day population genetically distinct from its forebears and source populations.[55] and observed variants under positive natural selection in a present-day society.[56]", "The company has also catalogued human knockouts - people missing certain genes - and reconstructed the genome of the first man of African descent to live in Iceland by analyzing the sequences of hundreds of his living descendants.[57] These studies are avidly followed by foreign and Icelandic media alike, and constitute another type of return that deCODE renders to the society it studies and works within.[citation needed]", "[edit]deCODE's scientific leadership over more than twenty years has enabled it repeatedly to pioneer new types of partnerships, products and applications for many aspects of precision medicine.", "Between 1998 and 2004, the company signed high-profile and innovative partnerships with pharmaceutical companies Roche, Merck, Bayer, Wyeth and others.", "These alliances provided research funding to advance deCODE's work, with goals of finding genetically validated new drug targets in common diseases; to develop DNA-based diagnostics, that could gauge risk of disease or predict drug response and identify patients most likely to benefit from a drug; and to design \"information-rich\" clinical trials that would enroll participants with particular genetic variants, with the potential to make trials smaller, more informative, and with a greater chance of success.[58]", "In 2002, deCODE acquired a Chicago-based medicinal chemistry company in order to discover compounds based on its genetics discoveries and so to begin to develop its own pipeline of new drugs.[59] Over the next few years the company initiated and completed several early-stage clinical trials for potential new treatments for heart attack, peripheral artery disease, and conducted work with partners on asthma and SMA.[60]", "These were early examples of what would today be called 'precision medicine' programs: using genetics for target discovery and to select trial participants by testing them for disease susceptibility through the same pathway targeted by the drug.[61]", "In the mid-2000s, deCODE launched a new kind of risk diagnostic focused largely on prevention and wellness.", "These DNA-based diagnostic tests detected genetic variants identified by deCODE and others that correlated with significantly increased individual risk of common diseases including heart attack,[62] atrial fibrillation and stroke, type 2 diabetes, common (non-BRCA) breast cancer, prostate cancer and glaucoma.[63] The type 2 diabetes test, for example, was based on published studies that showed that approximately 10% of people carried two copies of deCODE's highest impact risk variant, putting them at twice the average risk of developing diabetes, independent of obesity.", "The medical purpose of the test was \"to identify prediabetics at higher than average risk of progressing to full-blown diabetes, and that these same individuals can effectively counteract this added risk through weight loss and through the use of certain medications.\"[64]", "Another novel characteristic of these tests was the integration of multiple, well-validated genetic risk factors.", "The overall impact of these different risk factors was combined and calculated into what was called a polygenic risk score, placing the individual on a spectrum of risk with regard to that of the population in general, independent of and in addition to other health or lifestyle risk factors.[65]", "With each new discovery, deCODE could broaden the risk factors tested. The idea was to make screening and prevention strategies and therapies more specific and more effective for those at higher risk, and hopefully to provide new incentive for individuals to follow through with well understood lifestyle modification such as weight loss, smoking cessation, etc.[66]", "This was the essence of what was then called personalized medicine, but because these tests were new, their medical usefulness was as yet unproven.", "As everyone is by definition at risk of common diseases, and doctors generally understood genetic risk only as it referred to rare diseases, the medical community approached these tests with skepticism.[67]", "In 2018, advocacy for the use of polygenic risk scores for identifying those at significantly increased risk of common diseases, and using whole-genome data and new algorithms to build on many early deCODE markers, began a revival.[68]", "To judge by the intense media coverage of deCODE's discoveries, ordinary people were very certainly interested in these genetic risk factors and how they might be relevant to their health.", "In late 2007, the company effectively launched the field of personal genomics with its deCODEme[69] direct-to-consumer (DTC) scan aimed at enabling people to better understand their risk of common diseases and use this information to stay healthy.", "deCODEme hit the market a day before the now widely known, Google-funded 23andMe.[70] deCODEme's marketing emphasized its pedigree, seriousness and scientific rigor: \"provided by a world leader in the discovery of genetic risk factors for disease...[so that its customers] benefit directly from the knowledge and experience of scientists carrying out internationally renowned research\" (its competitors used deCODE's published variants as the basis for many of their results); with the scan processed in the same labs that had found them.", "By 2012, the deCODEme complete scan measured one million SNPs and calculated risk for 47 common diseases and traits as well as basic information on maternal and paternal ancestry, noting that most ancestry scans of the period were not back by much data.[71]", "Despite deCODEme's emphasis that its results were for informational purposes — \"a roadmap to improve your health\" — and the provision of genetic counseling for users who had questions about their results, US regulators quickly took a critical view of disease risk assessments being put directly in the hands of consumers.[72] In June 2010, the FDA wrote to deCODE[73] and its main competitors to say that they considered such scans to be medical devices requiring FDA approval.[74] Facing regulatory headwinds and then corporate reorganization, deCODE stopped selling deCODEme in late 2012.[75]", "In 2017, the FDA began to approve certain assessments of genetic risk for disease in consumer tests.[76]", "In 2018, deCODE broke new ground with a direct intervention in public health and the first national genetic screening program of its kind.", "The company launched a website that enables anyone in Iceland to ask the company - free of charge - to search their whole genome sequence data to determine whether they are likely carriers of a SNP in the BRCA2 gene that confers high risk of breast and prostate cancer in Iceland.", "Within months, ten percent of the population had requested their BRCA2 status, and the National Hospital has built up its counseling and other services to help people follow up on their preliminary results and use the information to protect their health.[77]", "[edit]Despite its pathbreaking science, or perhaps because it was often far ahead of the field, deCODE had a volatile history as a standalone business.", "In July 2000, it completed a $200 million IPO on Nasdaq, big for the time and the first listing by an Icelandic company on a US exchange.", "Its early pharmaceutical alliances, particularly that with Roche, further helped to fund the enrollment of most of the adults in the country in the first decade of its research, and the rapid expansion of both its discovery capabilities and its product development efforts in drugs, diagnostics and personal genomics.[78]", "From a scientific perspective, as the Broad Institute's David Altschuler told the MIT Tech Review in 2004, \"This is a business in which critical mass is important, and they have achieved critical mass.\"[79]", "But the business was also about money. Being an innovation enterprise pioneering new markets, the company had spent more than $500 million on R&D in its first decade and never been profitable.", "By 2006 it was borrowing more,[80] to fund drug development programs based on completely novel premises; to bring forward diagnostic tests in a market that even supporters termed \"still embryonic\"; and to market personal genomics, where it was being overshadowed by the Silicon Valley glamour and cash of 23andMe.[81]", "By late 2008, the company was \"between a rock and a hard place,\" in Stefansson's own words.[82] Under threat of being delisted from Nasdaq for its flagging stock price, the company needed more capital just as the global markets were going into crisis.[83]", "Although its scientists kept publishing breakthroughs at a remarkable rate, in late 2009, the company's listed US holding company, deCODE genetics, Inc., declared Chapter 11 bankruptcy.[84] Its key assets - the heart of which was the Iceland genetics operation - were bought and kept running by a consortium of the company's two main original venture backers: ARCH Venture Partners and Polaris Ventures, along with Illumina, Inc., the dominant maker of genotyping chips and sequencing equipment.[85]", "It abandoned work on its drug development programs.[86]", "As a business, deCODE had in some sense gone back to the future: it was a 13-year-old company with a global reputation, again backed by its original VCs, which Newsweek called \"the world's most successful failure.", "\"[87] During the following period Stefansson mused publicly that deCODE had been founded between six and ten years too early.[88]", "The technology for accurately reading DNA with sufficient detail, he reasoned, had not arrived until the mid-2000s, leaving deCODE in debt for years of R&D but based on findings that didn't provide a detailed enough insight into the biology of disease to swiftly create commercially compelling diagnostics and developmental drugs.[89]", "What might provide that insight was population-scale WGS data. By 2010 Stefansson was outlining how to sequence a few thousand individuals and then use imputation - powered again by the genealogies - to ensure that deCODE would be the first in the world to have anything like it.[90]", "In spite of its straitened circumstances, with Illumina as one of its owners the company could still receive the latest sequencing machines and reagents.", "In 2011, deCODE and Illumina collaborated on a paper that gave an early hint at the power of WGS imputation, turning 500 sequences into 40,000 whole genomes of data.", "This was enough to begin to discover rare variants, validated through replication in several other populations.[91] Unlike common variants, mutations causing rare diseases tend to be in the regions of genes that encode proteins, providing both a direct window on disease biology and so more direct utility as drug targets.", "In December 2012, the American pharmaceutical company Amgen acquired deCODE for $415 million.[citation needed]", "A key rationale for the acquisition was deCODE's unique ability to use WGS data to discover rare coding variants and cause extreme versions of more common diseases.", "As Sean Harper, then Amgen's head of R&D told Forbes, \"It was really working on targets like PCSK9 [for heart disease]...that really drove home the immense value of having targets that have either been discovered or validated by the kind of human genetic analysis that Decode is a world expert in.", "\"[92] More broadly, these capabilities could be applied to evaluate current programs as well, and within month of the acquisition deCODE had reviewed Amgen's entire pipeline.", "In 2018, Harper estimated that \"just [by] having strong genetic support for half your pipeline you can improve your rate of return on R&D investments by approximately 50%.\"[93] By 2020, Amgen had brought two new cardiovascular drugs into clinical trials based directly on deCODE discoveries, which continue to be published in leading scientific journals.[94]", "[edit]Introducing Stefansson for the organizations at the American Society of Human Genetics annual meeting in 2017, the Broad Institute's Mark Daly observed that the meeting and the field were dominated by \"a pervasive paradigm involving biobanks recruited with full population engagement, historical medical registry data, investments in large-scale genetic data collection and statistical methodology, and collaborative follow-up across academic and industry boundaries...[and] deCODE provided the template for this discovery engine.\"[95]", "From its early days, deCODE's example gave fresh impetus to others hunting for disease genes in isolated communities and small populations in Sardinia, Quebec, Newfoundland, northern Sweden, Finland, and elsewhere.", "However deCODE was not touting the Icelandic population's \"relative homogeneity\" in order to find variants causing rare syndromes, but because the existence of founder mutations would help to power discovery of variants impacting common disease.[96]", "In terms of its relevance to global medical challenges, Iceland was not an inbred population with a high prevalence of rare syndromes but rather a European society in miniature that could be studied as a whole: not the biggest small population so much as the smallest big one.[citation needed]", "The first large country to follow deCODE's example was the UK.[97] Iceland's experience, behind the scientific and medical value of applying the NHS's vast reach and resources to one of the most diverse populations in the world,[98] informed the authorization of the UK Biobank in 2003[99] and then Genomics England in 2013.", "Other early, large-scale biobank and genomics efforts linked to major health systems included the Million Veterans Program in the US, launched in 2009;[100]", "the Research Program on Genes, Environment and Health Archived 20 March 2020 at the Wayback Machine at California's Kaiser Permanente, begun in 2007; and the China Kadoorie Biobank in mainland China and Hong Kong begun in the mid-2000s.[101]", "After 2014, when Illumina announced that its new X-Ten system could sequence whole genomes at scale for $1000 each, national genome projects proliferated,[102] from the US (All of Us, alongside the MVP) and (alongside CKB) to Australia, Canada, Dubai Archived 10 May 2019 at the Wayback Machine, Estonia (originally begun in 2000), France, Hong Kong, Japan, Netherlands, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Singapore, South Korea, Sweden Archived 10 May 2019 at the Wayback Machine, and Turkey, and beyond.", "Although with varying focuses and approaches, all of these programs were at the least implicitly inspired by deCODE's example.[103]", "Other large projects led by pharmaceutical companies have closely followed deCODE's model and its work with Amgen.", "These include Regeneron's with the Geisinger health system in the US,[104] and Astra Zeneca's hybrid public/private/academic partnership with the Wellcome Trust in the UK, Craig Venter's Human Longevity in California, and Finngen in Helsinki.[105]", "The latter, founded by Broad Institute leaders and Finnish universities, the health ministry, and biobanks to drive drug discovery,[106] is remarkably close to deCODE's original vision in Iceland but with academics and government bodies as equity partners in the business.", "This public-private partnership model may explain the passage of legislation in Finland in 2019 authorizing the near wholesale use of anonymized medical records, social welfare data and biobank samples for biomedical research, which goes well beyond the ambitions of the 1998 IHD legislation that caused so much controversy in Iceland twenty years earlier.[107]", "deCODE's direct involvement and lineage is also evident across the field. deCODE is a founding member and leader of the Nordic Society of Human Genetics and Precision Medicine, which brings together the resources of all the Scandinavian countries and Iceland and Estonia to advance gene discovery and the application of precision medicine across the region.", "In 2013, a group of deCODE alumni created a spinoff, NextCODE Health (now Genuity Science), that licensed and further developed informatics and sequence data management tools originally developed in Iceland to support clinical diagnostics and population genomics in other countries.[108]", "Its systems and tools have been used by national genome projects in England,[109] Qatar,[110] Singapore;[111] pediatric rare disease programs in the UK, US[112] and China;[113] and at its subsidiary Genomics Medicine Ireland.", "In 2019, deCODE and US regional health system Intermountain partnered to conduct a 500,000-person WGS-based research and precision medicine study,[114] and deCODE also began sequencing 225,000 participants in the UK Biobank.[115]", "[edit]In March 2020, as the SARS-CoV-2 virus began to spread widely in Iceland, deCODE temporarily redirected its clinical research, laboratory staff and operations to conduct large-scale testing for COVID-19.", "This effort marked the company's deepest and most direct ever involvement in public health and constitutes an important component of one of the most intensive and successful containment strategies of any country in the early months of the global pandemic.[116]", "The response of Iceland's health authorities to the pandemic was notable for being an early, transparent and effective example of best-practice 'test, trace and isolate' epidemiological control.", "In late January 2020, the National Directorate of Health began testing people arriving in Iceland from high-risk areas or showing possible symptoms of infection, and, with the Department of Civil Protection and Emergency Management, activated a system to isolate anyone diagnosed with the virus and to trace and quarantine all of their contacts.[117] Iceland's first case was diagnosed on 28 February, a month after targeted testing began, and within days dozens of people were testing positive every day.", "Little more than two months later, Iceland was virtually free of active infections.[118]", "The foundation of this response and the data to guide it was testing. Yet while the official testing effort was prompt and energetic, it was focused on those who were either symptomatic or at high risk due to having likely been in contact with infected people.", "In early March, deCODE's CEO Kari Stefansson became concerned that without also screening the population at large there was no way to understand the virus' spread or its fatality rate, crucial information for holistically addressing the epidemic.[119]", "In this \"all-hands-on-deck\" moment, and with the know-how, people and equipment to rapidly turn the company's genetics research lab into a PCR diagnostic testing facility,[120] he offered to put the company's capabilities to work to screen the general population under the auspices of the Directorate of Health.[121] deCODE staff worked swiftly to put together workflows for everything from sample collection to running the tests to privacy-protected reporting, and to get the swabs and reagents ready to begin large-scale testing.", "On Thursday 12 March 2020, the company opened its website to book appointments for testing and within hours 12,000 people had signed up.", "Testing began the following morning, free of charge.[122]", "The deCODE effort scaled up quickly to a capacity of over 1000 samples per day. From the beginning of population screening, fewer than 1% of those taking part were found to be infected, indicating that the health authorities' containment strategy was working.[123][non-primary source needed] From mid-March to the end of May 2020, the company conducted an average of 600 tests a day, complementing the health authorities' 250 tests per day at the National-University Hospital.", "Those testing positive in deCODE's screening were similarly isolated and their contacts traced and asked to quarantine themselves.", "In total, by the beginning of June more than 60,000 tests had been conducted in Iceland, equivalent to 18 percent of the population.", "Powered by this combined testing strategy and tracing and isolation follow up, the number of infections in Iceland peaked in the first week of April and dropped steeply off by the end of the month.", "By mid-May, there were only a handful of active infections in the country, although deCODE and the health authorities continued to conduct as many as 200 tests per day thereafter to try to detect any fresh outbreaks.[124]", "In tandem with its screening work, deCODE used its genetics capabilities to sequence the virus from hundreds of infected individuals, and to draw a kind of genealogy of the different clades of the virus in the country.", "This showed how during the early weeks of the pandemic the virus had entered the country with people infected in different countries and then spread within Iceland.[125][non-primary source needed]", "In April 2020, with colleagues from the Directorate of Health and the national hospital, the company published in the New England Journal of Medicine a paper detailing what the spread of COVID-19 looks like across a population, and how a robust policy of testing, tracing and isolation could effectively contain it.", "In May, the company began work to develop and carry out antibody testing in the population, and early results showed that around one percent of the general population that had not been diagnosed with infection carried antibodies for the virus.", "This meant on the one hand that the virus had been swiftly and well contained, but also that nearly three times had been infected as had been officially diagnosed since the end of February and also that the population was still more than 98% naive.[126] That indicated that large-scale testing would need to continue to detect later outbreaks as the country reopened its borders to travel by its own citizens and others coming to Iceland.[127]", "In June, the company said that it was working with Amgen's unit in British Columbia to use white blood cells from recovered Icelandic COVID patients to begin to manufacture antibodies for the virus, which could be used either prophylactically or therapeutically.[128]", "[edit]The work of deCODE is criticised by Arnaldur Indriðason's novel Jar City from 2000, which was adapted into a 2006 film of the same name.[129]", "deCODE and Kári Stefánsson are satirised as VikingDNA and Professor Lárus Jóhannsson in Dauðans óvissi tími by Þráinn Bertelsson (Reykjavík: JPV Útgáfu, 2004).", "deCODE and specifically Kári Stefánsson is presented as the creator of monstrous genetic hybrids in Óttar M.

Whether 23andMe, with its deep pockets, will see it through to profitability is unclear.", "Although it now has no real competitors to worry about, it is lowering its prices, not raising them.

The first phase was the terror that accompanied the initial wave of the infection, when most rheumatology practices all but shut down.", "This forced rheumatologists to rethink financial structures, apply for assistance and find creative ways to stay solvent.", "This ushered in the next phase, when restrictions on telemedicine were lifted, allowing virtual visits that re-established doctor-patient relationships and brought much-needed income to practices that had been forced to furlough staff.", "“Early on, it seemed that the amount of evolution that, under normal circumstances, you might see in 6 months or a year, was happening each week,” Max I.

B. Baraf, MD, FACP, MACR, former managing partner of Arthritis and Rheumatism Associates and clinical professor of medicine at the George Washington University School of Medicine and Health Sciences in Washington, D.C., said in an interview.", "“Early on in the pandemic, CMS recognized that all outpatient medicine would be in trouble and patient access to care would be seriously hampered.", "To encourage telehealth, they removed the impediments that had previously encumbered telemedicine allowing it to ramp up rapidly and almost effortlessly.”", "Notable obstacles including physician site of service. technology platforms, documentation requirements and fear of audit were all relaxed, according to Baraf, who is also a member of the medical policy committee at United Rheumatology.", "“HIPAA itself has long been a tremendous impediment to care delivery,” he said. “But waiving HIPAA rules, allowing smart phone use and raising the levels of evaluation and management reimbursements to match in-office services helped to subsidize practices that would have gone under otherwise.", "Without these changes, patients would have lost their access to physician care during the quarantine and physician practices would not have been able to survive economically.”", "Andrew L. Concoff, MD, FACR, executive vice president and chief value medical officer at United Rheumatology, offered an explanation as to why the rheumatology community was loath to use telehealth for so long.", "“We let the perfect be the enemy of the good,” he said in an interview.", "The crux of the issue is that rheumatologists rely heavily on the physical exam to make diagnoses and key clinical distinctions, such as differentiating synovitis from arthralgias or tenderness from swelling.", "“In the past, we said we could never tell as much about a patient without a physical exam, so let’s just not pursue tele-rheumatology,” Concoff said.", "Cassandra Calabrese, DO, of the department of rheumatologic and immunologic disease at the Cleveland Clinic, had “reservations” about converting to telehealth visits.", "“At Cleveland, we were behind,” she acknowledged. “But we converted to a nearly 90% virtual platform pretty quickly, and we were pleasantly surprised at what could be achieved in a virtual visit.”", "While many rheumatologists and patients have reported satisfaction with an increased proportion of telehealth visits, the transition has not been smooth, according to Concoff.", "“At the moment, we are in this awkward hybrid of where we were before the pandemic and making do with whatever platform is fastest and easiest,” he said.", "“There has not been much thought or guidance about which patients needed priority or how to overcome technical complications.", "In a move that sought to ease these concerns, the American College of Rheumatology recently published a statement on tele-rheumatology.", "“The role of telemedicine [is] as a tool with the potential to increase access and improve care for patients with rheumatic diseases, but it should not replace essential face-to-face assessments conducted at medically appropriate intervals,” the statement reads.", "However, the ACR acknowledged that telehealth is the new reality for most rheumatologists and their patients, so the authors outlined four key principles for conducting virtual visits.", "The first is that the provider-patient relationship, regardless of whether the visit is via telehealth or in person, should follow ethical standards set by the AMA.", "The second is that patients should be able to choose their providers for telehealth visits. The third is that there should be no drop-off in standard of care during these visits, and that the obvious limitations of telehealth should be mitigated as effectively as possible.", "The fourth principle is that telehealth visits should be properly documented.", "In addition, informed consent mechanisms should be in place, along with protocols to protect patient information, provisions for interstate visits and proposals for outcomes-based research as more visits are conducted.", "The stipulations for interstate visits are necessary now, for one important reason highlighted by Concoff.", "“There is not a single, consistent picture for rheumatology in the pandemic across the country,” he said.", "“Depending on the state or region, and what the virus is doing, the needs and demands can vary greatly at any given point in time.”", "Later in the statement, the ACR supports the opportunity for patients, including those in rural areas, to use telemedicine after the pandemic has subsided.", "With this provision, the ACR may be positioning itself to stay one step ahead of the reality that telehealth will become part of routine care after COVID-19.", "There are a number of reasons experts in the specialty believe that tele-rheumatology may be here to stay.", "“We learned that for patients with stable disease, a short chat on video can be effective,” Calabrese said.", "“If need be, patients can do maneuvers or show me rashes while I watch on the phone.”", "Wright added another component to this advantage. “Another benefit is that I get to see patients in their homes, which means I can see the obstacles and physical barriers that give them trouble on a day-to-day basis,” she said.", "“I can tailor my advice based on their space, which can impact not only their physical functioning, but their quality of life.”", "It is also possible to evaluate soft targets, determine quality of sleep and monitor anxiety and depression, Wright added.", "“In addition, patients can assess their own pain, regardless of whether they are 100 miles or 100 inches from me.”", "One key is establishing strong communication, regardless of the platform. In many cases, this means comfort.", "With so many people in quarantine regularly using FaceTime, Skype and Zoom to communicate, providers have been able to find a tool for just about everyone.", "Another part of comfort pertains to travel. “The burden of commute is particularly stressful for many patients,” Wright said.", "“Telehealth allows them to stay where they are comfortable and limit the logistical considerations of coming into the office.”", "To bring all of it back to the question of whether these changes are likely to remain after COVID-19, Baraf was clear.", "“The horse is out of the barn with telehealth,” he said. “Hopefully, the government will take this reality check to heart and allow physicians and patients to use their own devices and communicate in any way they can.", "Lowering these barriers will be critical to patient care.”", "The primary focus of all of this, of course, is maintaining patient outcomes through and after the public health crisis.", "But rheumatologists, and rheumatology practices, need an income for this to happen.", "With this in mind, in another part of its statement, the ACR advocates for parity of reimbursement for in-office visits, audio-visual visits and audio-only visits, both by CMS and by commercial payers, after the public health emergency has ended.", "The ACR also opposes “payer policies which dictate use of specified telemedicine platforms, use telemedicine services to construct restrictive networks, or which use telemedicine as a means to divert patients to their preferred” providers, according to the authors of the statement.", "Reimbursement is critical because patient volume is low. Meaning: Every penny counts. Wright believes that the new normal in most rheumatology practices is somewhere around 60% of previous patient capacity.", "A combination of lingering patient fears, increased use of telemedicine and the necessities of social distancing and sanitation in the clinic may keep that number around 60% for quite some time, even after the virus has been controlled.", "The financial impact of this is obvious. “Depending on how flush the practice is, it is likely that most practices are going to have to cut clinical or support staff,” Wright said.", "Conversely, though, the demands of sanitation may force practices to make at least one new hire. “It may be necessary to have a staff member who just runs around cleaning,” Wright said.", "“I honestly think it will be a while before we forget about the horror of the pandemic, and the idea that touching a contaminated surface can lead to infection.", "A companion consideration is that most practices will have to keep a room empty for cleaning at all times in order to move patients most efficiently through exams.", "This alone will reduce the capacity for patient volume.", "As so many rheumatology practices consist of only one or two rheumatologists, the threat of closure is real.", "But organizations like United Rheumatology exist to advocate, to bring payers to the table, to ensure that these small practices stay afloat regardless of patient numbers.", "“We are working with payers and tech companies, we are looking at clinical and financial data and analyzing it,” Hamburger said.", "“The hope is to help practices learn from their peers and adapt.”", "Baraf noted a final financial consideration that is likely to impact rheumatology practice moving forward.", "“Rheumatology is a specialty that relies heavily on ancillary services like imaging, infusions and joint injections,” he said.", "“Ultimately, telehealth has been a very good stop-gap measure, but rheumatology is a hands-on specialty and face-to-face visits will remain the preferred mode of care.", "Delivery of these ancillary services are part and parcel of how we ideally manage patients and are also critical to the economics of rheumatology practice.", "In the years ahead, telehealth will play an important role, for the infirm, for patient’s who can’t travel and in other special circumstances.", "It will not, nor should it, go away but it is not a true substitute for hands-on treatment.”", "Shifting from ancillary services to pharmacotherapeutics, if there is an area where the ultimate impact of the pandemic is least clear, it is the possibility of drug shortages.", "“There are thousands of studies underway on ClinicalTrials.gov,” Calabrese said. “The drug shortage questions are apt to change pending these data.”", "If a certain drug is proven to be a game-changer, there may be shortage concerns about that drug, according to Calabrese.", "“For now, we just have to wait and see what looks promising,” she said.", "The good news is that most of the experts who spoke to Healio Rheumatology did not report difficulties in acquiring medications, even hydroxychloroquine.", "But given the rapid pace at which the pandemic is moving, the possibility of the emergence of positive trial results and the unpredictable information on drug efficacy emerging from the White House and other sources, that could change again.", "The question of possible shortages aside, Hamburger sees this moment as an opportunity for rheumatology to improve as a field.", "“Since 2010-2011, we have moved toward a treat-to-target approach, aiming for widely accepted composite indices of disease activity in many of the conditions we treat,” he said.", "“But many rheumatologists are not measuring disease activity frequently enough.”", "With fewer opportunities to see patients and the possibility of drug shortages looming, Hamburger believes that rheumatology should refine both targets and treat-to-target strategies.", "“COVID has forced us to utilize these measures more consistently,” he said. “A move toward a more precision medicine approach will not only help us separate which patients can be seen at home and which need to come into the office, but also help us use drugs more judiciously in the event of shortages.”", "Drug shortages and risks associated with entering the clinic are just two of the fears that patients have voiced throughout the pandemic.", "It is critical to address these and other fears head on, with accurate information, according to the experts.", "“Some degree of patient fear is good,” Calabrese said. “Of course, there are a lot of people who are not scared, and that is obviously a separate issue, but because their conditions tend to be chronic, our rheumatology patients are attuned to their health.”", "Calabrese suggested that fear of acquiring COVID-19 has forced rheumatology patients to pay even closer attention to their health-related behaviors.", "She believes that rheumatologists can, and should, capitalize on this. “Anything that leads our patients to want to increase their health literacy can be a positive.”", "The downside is that many patients remain terrified of even setting foot outside of their homes, much less into a health care facility.", "“They are not even getting routine issues taken care of, like dental visits, so many of our patients are definitely not getting appropriate labs or imaging analyses done,” Calabrese said.", "It is with patients like this in mind that Concoff suggested that the field needs to get creative. “It is more than telehealth,” he said.", "“We need to find different ways of connecting with patients. One way to do that is with mobile phlebotomy, where the lab can come to your door to draw blood to monitor medicines.”", "Another way to connect is to pay closer attention to mental health parameters. “Rheumatologists have traditionally performed poorly in assessing the psychological status of their patients,” Concoff said.", "“Anxiety and depression are present in many of our patients even without the pandemic. This is something we are going to have to think about moving forward.”", "Psychological comorbidities are associated not only with rheumatologic diseases, but with the virus, as well, according to Concoff.", "“We still do not know which of our patients may experience long-term complications from COVID-19,” he said.", "“Plus, you have to consider lockdown fatigue and anxiety, social isolation, all of these unique factors that we have all been dealing with.", "As rheumatologists, we are going to have to do a better job of understanding the total and behavioral health status of our patients.”", "It is with all of these factors in play that Concoff sees this moment as an opportunity for rheumatologists to elevate their game.", "“There has been a lot of talk about value-based care,” he said. “This pandemic may give us the chance to really put that into action.", "In short, if we can find a way to start paying rheumatologists to make the right choice at the right time, it can save money and improve patient outcomes.”", "For Hamburger, there is an analogy to be drawn between the immune system and the response to the pandemic.", "“The immune system must react and adapt,” he said. “That is what we must do.”", "While clinicians, researchers and payers work out the details of what “react and adapt” will entail through the next phases of COVID, Wright encouraged her colleagues to keep talking to patients, and focus on the basics.", "“I tell my patients: Stand outside your building and breathe fresh air,” she said. “Work in the garden if you have one.", "Touch the greenery. Go for a walk. And then I tell them: We can get through this.”", "Calabrese expressed a similar sentiment. “I do not lie to my patients about COVID,” she said. “I tell them that it is likely not going anywhere for a while.", "But whether I see them in the clinic or on their phone, I make sure one message is clear: We will take care of you.”", "- Herbert S.

And like breaches of the duty of prudence, breaches of the duty of loyalty require proving: (1) that the defendants acted as fiduciaries, (2) they breached their fiduciary duties, and (3) the breach caused a loss to the plan.", "Plaintiffs allege that all Defendants breached their duty of loyalty by not avoiding conflicts of interest and by placing their own and/or Target's interests above the interests of Plan participants.", "(See EAC ¶¶ 194, 200.) Defendants committed these breaches when they failed to engage independent fiduciaries, (id. ¶ 194), made direct or indirect communications with Plan participants omitting or misrepresenting information regarding or materially related to investments in Target stock, (id. ¶¶ 195, 208), and knowingly participated in each other's' failure to protect the Plan from such breaches, (id. ¶ 199).", "1.
