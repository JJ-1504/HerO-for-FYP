Released March 13, 2019", "In 2018, the U.S. solar market installed 10.6 gigawatts direct current (GWdc) of solar photovoltaic (PV) capacity, a 2% decline from capacity additions in 2017.", "After a year in which the residential sector experienced 15% contraction, 2018 marked a year of rebound as the residential market grew by 7%.", "Conversely, non-residential PV saw a slight annual decline of 8%. Utility solar also saw slight annual contraction, due to the impacts of Section 201 tariff uncertainty earlier in the year and shifting project timelines based on the tariff schedule.", "Overall, in 2018, solar PV has accounted for 29% of new electricity generating capacity additions – a lower share compared to 2017 due to a surge in new natural-gas plants in early 2018.", "After experiencing volume contraction last year, the residential solar market regained its footing in 2018 with steadily increasing installation volumes.", "The fourth quarter of 2018 was the largest quarter for the residential segment in two years. Five quarters of modest growth now suggest the market is adopting a more sustainable growth profile with a mix of local and regional installers operating alongside national installers.", "With 2018 in the books, a few key themes have emerged about the state of the residential solar market.", "Installation growth and market penetration levels suggest major states have moved past early adopters.", "Among the highest-penetration markets in the nation, residential growth rates were mixed in 2018. The one exception to this was Nevada, which experienced 3x growth once net metering was reinstated in 2017 after being revoked in 2016, which caused the market to contract by 61% from 2016 to 2017.This political turmoil led to abnormally high installations in 2018 based on pent-up demand.", "Outside the stabilizing large markets, growth in low-penetration emerging markets, such as Texas and Florida, continues to add to the geographic diversity of the residential market outside of California and the Northeast.", "Legacy markets are no longer the primary engines of growth. Though California is forecasted to be the largest market for the foreseeable future due to the sheer size of the state, the regional growth landscape began to shift and diversify in 2018.", "Of the top 10 markets in 2017, six markets experienced annual contraction in 2018 while two experienced double-digit percentage growth.", "Meanwhile, a handful of states are leapfrogging developed markets. Both Texas and Florida saw installations that surpassed legacy markets Maryland and Massachusetts last year, signaling new state-level leadership on residential solar development.", "In 2018, we saw a pivot away from legacy, incentive-driven markets and the emergence of low-penetration markets with limited third-party ownership options, good PV resources, and low electricity rates – a trend we expect to continue.", "Residential PV continues to be constrained by high costs of customer acquisition. Outside of overhead and margin, customer-acquisition costs remain the highest expense for installers of all sizes averaging 20% of the total system pricing.", "This reaffirms our view that at existing prices, sales and marketing is a vital part of continued residential market development.", "High customer-acquisition costs are directly related to high overall cost of installation, which also suggests a virtuous cycle of reduced costs.", "One target area for the industry to reduce costs is through streamlining the permitting and inspection processes, as permitting delays lead to customer attrition and other expenses.", "SEIA and the Solar Foundation, along with numerous companies, are working together to address these issues.", "New construction and roof replacement markets also represent an opportunity to address both customer-acquisition and permitting costs.", "However, at existing price levels, the high cost of customer-acquisition will slow growth in the near-term.", "Incentives and net metering remain important market enablers but show diminishing rates of return. While utility attempts to roll back net metering have been an issue in years past, this was not the case in 2018.", "No substantial revisions were made to residential NEM values in 2018 other than in Connecticut. In prior years, impending changes to NEM, other state-level incentives, or rate structures have created demand pull-in.", "Despite anticipated changes to incentives and NEM in 2019-2020, the major Northeast markets collectively saw no growth in installation volumes.", "This suggests that while changes to NEM policy and other incentives have greatly impacted growth in years past, 2018 marks a year of market maturation.", "While strong NEM policy remains an essential foundation for rooftop solar adoption, future growth across legacy markets will require technology and business-model innovation to tap into new customer demographics.", "Meanwhile, California’s new home solar mandate may signal the next phase of solar market adoption. The California Energy Commission’s decision in early 2018 to require solar PV on all new homes beginning in 2020 significantly insulates our long-term forecasts by adding an additional gigawatt of residential demand from 2020-2024E. While it remains to be seen whether other states will follow suit, some municipalities have created solar mandates for new buildings.", "Meanwhile, major national installers are spending considerable resources building relationships with housing developers to comply with California’s mandate while also aiming to capitalize on one-off housing developments outside of state mandates.", "With several newly announced entrants into the space, new home solar, whether mandated or voluntary, could provide an opportunity to bridge the cost of customer acquisition gap that has constrained growth.", "Unlike the case of residential PV, a handful of state-specific regulatory cliffs and policy reforms took effect in 2018, which led to a decline in non-residential build-out in the major markets of California and Massachusetts.", "Despite California’s market falling 17% year-over-year, the decline was not as severe as previously anticipated, as the extent of California’s pipeline of projects grandfathered in under solar-friendly time-of-use rates has been higher than previously assumed.", "However, Massachusetts witnessed 64% year-over-year decline in capacity installed as the industry awaited the start of the Solar Massachusetts Renewable Target (SMART) program.", "Combined, these two states saw a year-over-year decrease of more than 450 MW of installed non-residential PV capacity.", "New York bucked the national trend, experiencing record installations in 2018. This was the result of a waning pipeline of grandfathered remote net-metering projects becoming interconnected, despite being constructed in 2017.", "Meanwhile, community solar continues to support non-residential PV. Minnesota and Massachusetts contributed to well over 500 MW of community solar being installed this year.", "And while we won’t begin to see projects from New Jersey’s new community solar program until late 2019 at the earliest, the state is making significant strides in establishing the program, which technically kicks off in Q1 2019.", "Utility PV continues to hold the largest share of annual installations in the U.S. solar market with a total of 6.2 GWdc in 2018, accounting for 58% of total U.S. annual capacity additions.", "Lower-than-expected installation volumes in Q4 are primarily attributed to Section 201 module tariffs set in January 2018 and implemented in February 2018, which caused project sponsors to reassess a handful of project timelines and push out target commercial operation dates (CODs) from 2018 into 2019.", "In addition to tariff-related delays, interconnection delays for PURPA projects in the Carolinas contributed to lower-than-expected Q4 deployments.", "U.S. utility solar procurement has grown considerably with a number of utilities, such as Hawaiian Electric Company and Entergy Mississippi, announcing plans to add more utility PV to their generation portfolios due to the pure economic competitiveness of solar.", "In 2018, 13.2 GWdc of utility solar PPAs were signed, driving the contracted pipeline to 28.3 GWdc – the highest point in the history of U.S. solar.", "Most of these PPAs will be fulfilled with products imported after significant declines in the Section 201 tariffs.", "Voluntary procurement remains the largest driver of new PPAs signed and is expected to drive 51% of 2019 capacity additions.", "While commercial and industrial (C&I) off takers only accounted for 153 MW of actual capacity additions in 2018, C&I procurement drove 21% of all new PPAs signed last year.", "Meanwhile, new renewable portfolio standards are poised to drive additional utility PV.", "Many utility PV projects suffered disruption, delay and even cancelation due to the uncertainty leading up to the imposition of the Section 201 tariffs.", "The impacts can be seen in the volume of installations in 2018, which were down 7% year-over-year for utility-scale PV.", "However, since the tariffs were announced, the industry has pushed out timelines to account for the tariff stepdown schedule and has benefited from faster-than-expected declines in global module pricing.", "These price declines are mostly due to changes in China’s feed-in tariff policy that has resulted in a supply glut.", "While the Section 201 tariffs are still imposing a significant opportunity cost on the U.S. solar industry, new project procurement is moving forward thanks to strong industry fundamentals.", "Cell and module tariffs dropped from 30% to 25% in February 2019. Tariffs will drop to 20% in February 2020 and 15% in February 2021 before their scheduled expiration in February 2022.", "The International Trade Commission (ITC) will conduct a mid-term review of the tariffs starting in January 2020, at which point the President will have the opportunity to continue, modify, or terminate the tariffs.", "The ITC will begin data collection for that review this summer.", "Residential installation growth exceeded expectations for 2018, largely thanks to strong showings in California, Nevada and Florida.", "Still, as major state markets continue to grow past early-adopter consumers, higher costs of customer acquisition will challenge the industry to innovate.", "Long-term growth prospects benefit from (among other factors): geographic diversification outside of legacy state markets, California’s new home solar mandate, new incentive programs such as Illinois’ Adjustable Block Program, and technological/business model innovation to improve product offerings into solar-plus-storage.", "In 2018, the non-residential sector benefited from a large pipeline of projects grandfathered in under more favorable compensation policies in California and Massachusetts.", "California experienced commercial solar build-out in 2018, stemming from developers rushing to install projects to meet a (since-lifted) deadline to be grandfathered in under solar-friendly time-of-use rates.", "Meanwhile, New York saw its largest year ever for commercial installations as the remaining pipeline of remote net-metering projects came online.", "However, the delayed opening of the SMART program in Massachusetts resulted in that state seeing 325 MW less capacity installed in 2018 than in the record-breaking 2017.", "Additionally, the build-out of Xcel Energy’s robust community solar pipeline in Minnesota still accounts for a significant share of non-residential growth, with nearly 300 MWdc added in 2018.", "In total, Minnesota accounted for over 80% of the community solar build-out in 2018, while Massachusetts accounted for much of the remainder.", "Though the community solar market didn’t quite outpace 2017 capacity, last year marked the second consecutive year of over 500 MW of community solar installed.", "Utility PV continues to hold the largest share of annual installations in the U.S. solar market. In Q4 2018, 3.0 GWdc of utility PV capacity came online boosting the annual total to 6.2 GWdc in 2018.", "These additions represented 72% of total Q4 capacity and 58% of total U.S. capacity additions for the year.", "Lower-than-expected installation volumes in Q4 can be primarily attributed to two factors. The module tariffs set in January 2018 caused a handful of projects to reassess project timelines and push out target completed operation dates (CODs) from 2018 into 2019.", "Additionally, a handful of PURPA projects in the Carolinas have faced interconnection delays or have been outright canceled as utilities push back against standard rate agreements.", "U.S. utility solar market procurement has grown considerably, largely set for years when tariffs have decreased.", "Many utilities like Tennessee Valley Authority, Georgia Power and Northern Indiana Public Service Co., have announced plans to add more utility PV to their generation portfolios.", "With 13.2 GWdc of utility solar PPAs signed in 2018, the contracted pipeline peaked in Q3 2018 at 25.3 GWdc, the highest in the history of U.S. solar, and declined slightly in Q4 as project completion outpaced new PPAs signed.", "We employ a bottom-up modeling methodology to track and report national average PV system pricing for the major market segments.", "This methodology is based on tracked wholesale pricing of major solar components and data collected from interviews with major installers.", "Note: Detailed information about national system prices by market segment and component is available in the full report.", "In Q4 2018, system pricing fell in all market segments. Quarter-over-quarter, system pricing fell by 1.3%, 1.1%, 3.3% and 3.9% in the residential, non-residential, utility fixed-tilt and utility single-axis tracking markets, respectively.", "Prices across market segments are now all at historic lows despite tariffs on modules, inverters, aluminum and steel: $2.98/Wdc, $1.51/Wdc, $0.93/Wdc and $1.04/Wdc for residential, non-residential, utility fixed-tilt and utility single-axis tracking systems, respectively.", "Year-over-year system pricing fell by 4%, 8.5%, 15.1% and 14.4% in the residential, non-residential, utility fixed-tilt and utility single-axis tracking markets, respectively.", "Price declines continue to be led by declining hardware costs, with much of the reduction coming in module pricing.", "Cuts to demand in China last June created global module over-supply conditions that led to lower module prices, somewhat mitigating the impacts of module tariffs in the U.S.", "The tariffs still, however, impose an opportunity cost on the U.S. industry, which cannot fully take advantage of pricing available to the rest of the world.", "After modest decline in 2018, the national solar PV market will resume growth in 2019-2020, primarily driven by continued growth in the residential segment and a rebound in the utility PV sector.", "For utility PV, the downside to our 2018 forecasts benefits 2019 – the 2019 forecast has been increased from 7.2 GWdc to 7.8 GWdc as projects have pushed out target completion dates, and 2.1 GWdc of capacity is already under construction.", "The forecasts for 2020 and 2021 have increased to 10 and 10.4 GWdc, respectively. Of the projects announced in 2019, 68% have 2020 or 2021 target CODs, significantly boosting confidence in the near-term forecast.", "And we expect to see at least half of 2023 capacity additions leverage a 22% or higher ITC. Finally, growth will continue into 2024, driven by current utility IRPs for solar capacity along with the economic fundamentals of utility solar projects.", "After examining the risks of advanced procurement, many project developers now seem more open to anchoring projects in 2019 to claim the 30% ITC and bringing them online in 2021 or later.", "Still, several developers have suggested they will assess each project on a case-by-case basis.", "Commercial and industrial procurement is expected to remain a strong driver of utility solar over the next several years as the number of companies pledging to meet 100% renewables or zero-carbon targets increases.", "Renewable portfolio standards (RPSs) are also poised to see a resurgence as a driver of utility PV. Many of the newly elected governors are in states that have joined the U.S. Climate Alliance or campaigned on a pledge to join the Alliance and commit to the Paris Agreement in lieu of federal participation.", "Six of the governors have proposed increases to RPS targets, while three (Colorado, Nevada, and Illinois) have proposed 100% RPS mandates.", "This is in addition to California’s 100% RPS, Hawaii’s 100% RPS, and New York’s 50% RPS. If all states where elected governors campaigned on RPS increases were to achieve 50% RPS compliance by 2030, it could drive up to 37.0 GWdc of additional solar.", "Wood Mackenzie’s utility PV five-year forecast has increased 2.3 GWdc since our last report as more projects are announced, utilities include more solar in long-term resource planning, and development is driven increasingly by C&I offtakers.", "For residential PV, after seeing 7% growth in 2018, we expect flat to tempered growth in 2019, primarily due to major market maturation resulting in limited long-term growth opportunities in major Northeast markets.", "Meanwhile, the approval of a super off-peak rate in Southern California Edison territory – the second-largest utility in the nation for solar PV – takes effect in 2019, which severely limits the economic attractiveness of solar-only products.", "That said, growth resumes in 2020-2021 as the ITC step-down is expected to pull in demand in both legacy and emerging markets before declining in 2022.", "Growth resumes in 2023 and continues into 2024 based on economic fundamentals as the market adjusts to the post-ITC reality.", "In the long-term, residential capacity growth will be driven by California’s new home solar mandate – with upside potential from other states adopting similar mandates – a robust incentive program in Illinois, emerging markets like Texas and Florida becoming the new engines of retrofit growth, and the proliferation of solar-plus-storage.", "Meanwhile, the non-residential PV market is on track for another down year as the segment acclimates to a reduced incentive environment across major state markets in 2019.", "However, this will be incrementally offset starting in 2020 as the next wave of states with robust community solar mandates – New York, Maryland, Illinois and New Jersey – begin to see the realization of those pipelines.", "Increasing solar-plus-storage viability will also begin to have an impact on non-residential demand.", "By 2023, roughly 30% of non-residential PV will come from community solar, and ~20% will come from solar-plus-storage projects.", "By 2020, 28 states in the U.S. are expected to have 100+ MWdc annual solar markets, with 25 of those states being home to more than 1 GWdc of operating solar PV.", "This compares to only two states with 100+ MWdc annual solar markets in 2010.", "Forecast details by state (43 states plus Washington, D.C.) and market segment through 2024 are available in the full report.", "U.S. solar market insightÂ® is a quarterly publication of Wood Mackenzie Power & Renewables, Inc. d/b/a Greentech Media and the Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA)Â®.", "Each quarter, we collect granular data on the U.S. solar market from nearly 200 utilities, state agencies, installers and manufacturers.", "This data provides the backbone of this U.S. solar market insightÂ® report, in which we identify and analyze trends in U.S. solar demand, manufacturing and pricing by state and market segment.", "We also use this analysis to look forward and forecast demand over the next five years.

But it also started to become difficult for Duke Energy to manage.", "“In 2018, we're in a situation where we're going to dump power or repurpose it, sell it to somebody, or curtail our solar facilities, the 250 megawatts we own,” said Emily Felt, director of federal energy policy at Duke Energy, speaking at Solar Power International last fall when she held the title of renewable strategy and policy director.", "“This is a situation that caused us as a constituent in the state to advocate for change.”", "Not all states have as much solar or such favorable PURPA policies as North Carolina, and yet they’re also starting to consider reforms.", "Oregon, Utah, Wyoming, Michigan and Montana have all recently made or sought modifications to contract lengths and rates, as well as other changes that could complicate project financing for solar developers.", "In Michigan, PURPA changes approved in September were modest, while other states have reduced contract durations and lowered avoided costs to the point where renewable project developers say they can barely compete.", "When Matt McGovern, CEO of Cypress Creek Renewables, was asked by a utility representative at Solar Power International why PURPA is so important, he said it’s because in the vast majority of regulated utility markets, “if not for PURPA being on the books, [renewables] would have literally zero access.”", "PURPA will continue to be a priority for project developers and utilities in 2018 as other states propose changes.", "Distributed energy compensation and related rate changes are familiar issues, and they will continue to be significant in 2018.", "The most recent 50 States of Solar report by the North Carolina Clean Energy Technology Center found that 41 states and the District of Columbia took some type of solar policy action during Q3 2017.", "With a total of 142 solar policy actions across the U.S. during the third quarter, Q3 2017 featured the highest number of solar policy actions NCCETC has seen since it started tracking the field.", "Twenty-four states considered or enacted changes related to net energy metering (NEM), and 19 states plus Washington, D.C. formally examined or made a plan to examine the value of distributed generation or the costs and benefits of NEM.", "Some recent NEM changes are just now going into place. In Indiana, for instance, NEM compensation will gradually decrease this year through 2022, at which point customers will be credited at the utility’s wholesale rate plus 25 percent.", "Based on current prices, the drop will be from roughly 11 cents per kilowatt-hour to about 4 cents per kilowatt-hour.", "Michigan also voted to eliminate NEM, and is now working to establish a new distributed generation program and tariff.", "Michigan Public Service Commission staff issued a draft report on the tariff and asked for public comments by January 10.", "The policy debate will play out over the course of the year with the final result ultimately included in utilities’ next round of rate cases.", "Ohio adopted new NEM rules last fall, but components of the order may be appealed. The issue is also expected to re-emerge in Phase 3 of the Public Utilities Commission of Ohio's PowerForward initiative, set to begin in the first quarter of 2018.", "And in Maine, net metering will begin to phase out in April of this year. However, the Conservation Law Foundation is now legally challenging that decision.", "NEM has proven to be a simple and effective driver of distributed solar in the U.S. But utilities across the country have argued that the solar incentive increases electricity costs for others, by shifting at least some of the costs of maintaining the grid that should be borne by solar customers onto other ratepayers.", "NEM is also a blunt tool -- it doesn’t incentivize DER projects where and when they could be of greatest benefit to the grid.", "The ways that states decide to design DER rates for the future will be a topic to watch in 2018. Some utilities have sought to address the rise of distributed solar by proposing demand charges or increased fixed fees, often targeted specifically at solar customers.", "But regulators have rejected those requests far more often than they've approved them.", "In Q3 2017, of 26 pending or decided utility requests for fixed charges, only one was granted in full.", "Regulators have tended to prefer more incremental changes and more sophisticated tariff designs that address issues across the grid.", "Time-of-use rates are proving to be central in this discussion. In Arizona, TOU rates are now the default scheme for all new Tucson Electric Power customers and optional for existing customers.", "In California, solar customers are already moving to time-sensitive rates, and all residential customers will move to default TOU rates in 2019.", "How those rates are structured will be subject to ongoing debate, as regulators establish how to structure the rates and when to set peak hours.", "Other states are looking to introduce TOU plans, as well. Xcel Energy in Minnesota is hoping to get approval later this year for a two-year residential time-of-use pilot, which could serve as a model for effective rate design.", "The program is intended to determine if TOU rates can reduce peak demand across the system, but also to study the implementation and education needs for TOU rates and assess how customers are affected.", "Customers will be educated throughout the process on how to reduce their energy use and take advantage of new rates.", "The pilot will involve 17,500 homes in two areas of the Twin Cities; 10,000 of them will adopt TOU rates and the remainder will serve as a control group on existing rates.", "The proposal includes other unique elements, such as bill protection. If a pilot participant's bill increases more than 10 percent in the first year, Xcel will credit them the overages.", "Low-income participants will have bill protection during both years. The pilot is also being conducted on an opt-out basis, rather than opt-in, to make customer recruitment easier.", "It also includes a first-of-its-kind methodology designed by Strategen Consulting that incorporates current and forecasted renewable energy penetrations, and incentivizes customers to use energy when there’s excess renewable energy available.", "The three-tiered rate design also features a high peak-to-off-peak ratio that’s expected to incentivize peak reduction and the adoption of load management technologies.", "The program was designed through a highly collaborative process, and has earned widespread praise and support as a result.", "With so many states currently evaluating alternatives to NEM and new DER compensation schemes, positive examples will help pave the way for others."]}

approaches to funding energy assistance for low-income residents from federal, state and private sources.", "This ASPE Research Brief presents the results of an intramural ASPE study of selected energy assistance funding sources and approaches in six states: California, Colorado, Florida, Illinois, Massachusetts and Michigan.", "The brief was written by Alana Landey of ASPE's Office of Human Services Policy with assistance from Yuliya Rzad, Administration for Children and Families, Office of Community Services.", "Office of the Assistant Secretary for Planning and Evaluation", "Approaches to Low-Income Energy Assistance Funding in Selected States", "States rely on a variety of funding sources to help low-income residents pay their utility bills and reduce home energy costs.", "The Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP), administered by the Administration for Children and Families in the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), is the chief source of federal low-income energy assistance.", "However, a variety of other federal, state and local programs and resources also play key roles in helping vulnerable Americans heat, cool and weatherize their homes.", "As a capped block grant program, LIHEAP serves only a small proportion of those eligible for benefits, and funding for the program has fluctuated considerably over the past several years.", "The relatively limited reach of the program compared to overall need is an incentive for states to identify and use nonfederal funding sources.", "While the assistance provided from these other sources is key, little is known about how individual states utilize these various funding streams to provide energy assistance.", "This research brief presents findings from a qualitative study of energy assistance funding sources and strategies in six purposively selected states – California, Colorado, Florida, Illinois, Massachusetts and Michigan.", "It identifies promising practices that other states may want to consider as they confront limited federal energy assistance funding and that may merit further study.", "The information presented here is based on a qualitative study, conducted by HHS staff, of six purposively selected states – California, Colorado, Florida, Illinois, Massachusetts and Michigan.", "While these states represent some variation in region, climate, proportion of population in poverty, and size of LIHEAP grant, they primarily were chosen based on (1) anecdotal evidence from federal and state experts of effective leveraging of disparate funding sources and promising private sector/state partnership arrangements, and (2) willingness to participate in the study.", "While the findings presented here are likely unique to these particular states and cannot be generalized to all states, we identify some common themes across the six states studied.", "The study is intended as a step toward better understanding how states utilize a variety of funding sources and partnership strategies to provide energy assistance to their neediest residents.", "Information was obtained via telephone conversations, e-mail inquiries and Internet research from a variety of sources in each state, including state LIHEAP directors and their staffs, public utility commissions, utility companies and their web sites, and private nonprofits involved in energy assistance efforts.", "We also consulted several national resources such as the LIHEAP Clearinghouse, a repository of state and federal LIHEAP information maintained by HHS, and representatives of national organizations such as the National Association for State Community Services Programs, the National Energy Assistance Directors Association, and the National Energy and Utility Affordability Coalition.", "This brief and accompanying state profiles present funding figures and funding sources as provided by study respondents in telephone conversations and e-mail.", "In some cases, particularly in the case of private funds, these figures are rounded or approximate, and are sometimes derived from information collected informally by those we consulted.", "We used FY 2012 as the base year for funding data since that year was easiest for states to provide, but in some cases we also cite other years for comparison purposes or when more recent numbers were available.", "Overview of Main Energy Assistance Funding Sources", "States can draw from a number of federal, state and local resources to provide energy assistance to their residents.", "While LIHEAP represents the main source of federal energy assistance, the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) provides weatherization assistance funding via formula grants to states and the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) provides utility assistance through rent subsidies.", "State and local resources can include appropriations from state general funds; state-assessed surcharges on customers of regulated utilities (called ratepayer funds); voluntary utility company programs encouraging contributions from customers and employees; and charitable contributions funded by private nonprofit organizations, religious groups and foundations.", "Categories and amounts of funding differ considerably across states, as the table below and the attached state profiles show.", "For four of the six study states, LIHEAP represents the largest source of energy assistance funding, while in California and Massachusetts, state ratepayer funds are the primary funding source.", "There are five potential sources of federal energy assistance funding:", "LIHEAP: LIHEAP was established in 1981 to provide block grant funds and emergency funds to states, territories and tribes to assist low-income households with heating and cooling expenses and home weatherizing.", "The program is funded at $3.4 billion for FY 2014,1 compared to peak program funding of more than $5 billion in FYs 2009 and 2010.", "Funds are distributed to states through a formula that takes into account each state’s proportion of low-income households, the cost and prevalence of fuel types used for residential heating and cooling, and climate.", "Benefits are structured to provide the highest level of assistance to those with the lowest incomes, taking into account household size and energy expenses.", "HHS awards LIHEAP grants to state agencies (typically human services departments), the majority of which then subgrant funds to community action agencies, other nonprofits, or local governments that determine client eligibility and benefit levels.", "The LIHEAP statute requires that each grantee set income eligibility thresholds at or below 150 percent of the HHS poverty guidelines or 60 percent of the state median income, provided that no income threshold is lower than 110 percent of the HHS poverty guidelines.", "Each grantee has the discretion to set the specific income threshold as well as define countable and noncountable income.", "Grantees also have the option of applying assets tests and creating additional eligibility requirements not related to income.", "In addition to the block grant, LIHEAP includes emergency contingency funds that are released by the Secretary of HHS during times of energy price increases or extreme weather (although no contingency funds have been appropriated since 2011), leveraging incentive funds to reward states for raising additional funding from nonfederal sources, and funds for demonstration projects that focus on the intersection of energy, health and safety.", "States have the discretion to use up to 15 percent of their LIHEAP grants (or up to 25 percent with an approved waiver) for weatherization activities.", "The proportion of income spent on residential energy – known as energy burden – is higher for low-income households than for all households, primarily because income is lower but also in part because the homes tend to be older and less energy-efficient.", "Energy burden for LIHEAP recipient households is reduced due to LIHEAP benefits, but even with the assistance, historically LIHEAP household energy burden is about twice that of all households.2 LIHEAP reaches a relatively small fraction of eligible households, due to the limited nature of the block grant relative to the number of low-income individuals", "nationwide.3 The percent of eligible households receiving LIHEAP dropped from 36 percent at the beginning of the program in 1981 to 15 percent in 1997, and the participation rate has remained at about that level since.4", "As shown in Table 1, the six states in this study had FY 2012 LIHEAP grants that varied from a low of $47 million in Colorado to a high of $186 million in Illinois.", "Weatherization Assistance Program (WAP): DOE administers WAP, created in 1976 to provide formula grant funds to states to improve home energy efficiency and reduce energy consumption by low-income households.", "The funding distribution formula is based on the size of each state’s low-income population, climate, and energy expenditures by low-income households.", "As noted above, states can allocate up to 15 percent of their LIHEAP grant to low-income residential weatherization or other energy-related home repair, and over time states’ contributions of LIHEAP funding for weatherization have come to exceed the DOE budget for WAP.5 WAP funding was approximately $250 million from FY 2002 to FY 2007, then surged in FY 2009 with a $5 billion infusion under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act.", "Subsequent appropriations have been lower, and WAP provided a total of $138 million to states in FY 2013.6 Normally, WAP funding is distributed to all states based on the allocation formula, but in 2012 some states – including two states in this study, Colorado and Florida – received no WAP funding.", "This was a one-time change to redistribute funds from states that had not yet expended all their Recovery Act weatherization funds to states that had spent all their funds.", "Housing supports: HUD funding assists in paying energy costs for low-income public housing and assisted-housing residents.", "HUD’s efforts are aimed at both subsidizing utility costs for residents of public housing and retrofitting publicly subsidized low-income housing to be more energy-efficient.", "In Section 8 and other assisted housing units, HUD rental assistance is used to pay utilities that are included as part of the rent.", "For units where heating and air conditioning are not included in the rent, families in Housing Choice Voucher programs may receive a utility allowance to pay for reasonable utility costs.", "States vary considerably in how they take into account these HUD-funded utility subsidies in determining LIHEAP eligibility for subsidized housing tenants who have out-of-pocket utility costs.", "Some states reduce the LIHEAP benefit by a flat amount and others use actual out-of-pocket costs to determine benefit amounts.", "About half the states deny LIHEAP eligibility to subsidized housing residents whose energy costs are included in their rent.7 HUD does not report energy assistance funding at the state level, and this study did not capture any HUD funding in the study states.", "Temporary Assistance to Needy Families (TANF): States can use their HHS-administered TANF block grant funds to help recipient households pay utility costs, although little data exist to document the extent of this practice.", "Some states do this under the “assistance” category of spending since it can include benefits directed at basic needs, which includes utility payments, and some states categorize it as “non-assistance” if it is a nonrecurring, short-term benefit.", "According to a national study of TANF spending done in 2009, five states used TANF funding for emergency energy assistance.8 Among the six states included in the present study, Michigan reported using about $30 million of its TANF funding to provide energy assistance to TANF clients also on LIHEAP.", "Community Services Block Grant (CSBG): CSBG, another HHS program, funds a wide variety of antipoverty programs administered at the community level through local agencies that often also administer LIHEAP funds passed down from the state.", "CSBG funding can be used for emergency assistance, which includes emergency fuel and utility payments.", "In FY 2009, 3.7 million families received help with fuel or utility payments through CSBG.9 It is possible that some of these households received LIHEAP benefits as well.", "While none of the states in this study reported using CSBG funding for energy assistance, it is possible local agencies utilize this funding source.", "States can draw from several main sources of public funding at the state level:", "Ratepayer funds: Many states mandate that their public, regulated energy utilities impose a surcharge on their customers to fund ratepayer programs that allow the utility companies to provide discounts on low-income customers’ utility bills.", "The LIHEAP Clearinghouse reports that there are over 300 state-mandated and voluntary fuel funds in at least 47 states.10 In some states, the funds collected through ratepayer programs go to the state to augment LIHEAP funding; in other states, utility companies administer the utility bill subsidies for their customers directly.", "We categorize state-mandated ratepayer funds as state public funding since most states have laws requiring the collection of those funds and their use for low-income energy assistance, even though not all of these funds pass through state hands or are administered as part of states’ LIHEAP programs.", "In this study, state-mandated ratepayer programs were significant sources of energy assistance for California, Colorado, Illinois and Massachusetts.", "This was the case in Michigan as well, until a 2012 court ruling determined that the state can no longer mandate regulated utilities to collect ratepayer surcharges, which halted ratepayer funding.", "Before the court ruling, Michigan split $70 million in ratepayer fund revenue between the state LIHEAP program and state community action agencies to serve those who did not qualify for LIHEAP but needed utility bill assistance, and utilities used some of the funds to provide weatherization and rate discounts to low-income customers.", "Michigan utility vendors are now running a voluntary ratepayer program that generated $50 million in 2013.", "Illinois has both a state-mandated ratepayer fund and a voluntary, vendor-administered ratepayer fund.", "Percent-of-income payment programs (PIPPs): Revenues from ratepayer programs can also fund PIPPs, in which low-income customers agree to pay a set percentage of their incomes toward their utility bills in exchange for discounts on bills.", "In some cases, PIPP participation can include forgiveness of arrearages, or accrued amounts owed on utilities.", "Two of the study states – Colorado and Illinois – are among the eight states nationally that are known to have PIPPs.11", "General funds: Some states, including Massachusetts and Michigan in this study, also provide general funds appropriated by the state legislature for energy assistance purposes.", "This is a fairly widespread practice nationally: in 2010, 22 states reported using a total of $591 million in state and local funds to supplement LIHEAP.12", "However, few states are able to use their own funds for this purpose on a regular basis, and the amounts tend to fluctuate in response to energy prices and LIHEAP funding levels.13", "States can draw on a variety of private funding sources to augment public funding of energy assistance.", "These most typically take the form of voluntary vendor donation programs and programs run by private nonprofit and religious organizations.", "All of the six states in this study, with the exception of California, have some form of privately funded energy assistance available to their residents.", "In some cases those funds are administered by local LIHEAP agencies, and in other cases the private organization provides the assistance directly to customers or to local nonprofit service agencies that administer the funds.", "| state funding (including mandated ratepayer

summarized below, and described in more detail in the attached state profiles.", "California has a particularly well-funded ratepayer program.

By paring the tax breaks identified in this report, or by re-introducing some form of a “minimum tax” requiring profitable companies to pay at least some tax in any profitable year, Congress and President Biden could take a major step toward a fairer and more sustainable tax system.", "Another ITEP report explains in more detail how corporations avoid taxes, why this is a problem and what Congress can do about it.", "The authors of this report would like to thank ITEP tax interns David Crawford and Devin Douglass for their work tabulating data for this analysis."]}

In its recent solicitations, Xcel has gotten more bids for renewables, with more variety, for much cheaper.", "Wind and solar plants paired with storage are bidding in cheaper than the ongoing operating costs of existing coal plants.", "Renewables are even giving natural gas a run for its money.", "Second, Xcel’s customers — particularly cities — are demanding it. “When your customers are asking for this over and over,” Fowke said when announcing the news, “you really do listen.", "Boulder, the city of Denver, Breckenridge ...

These “rate-based” investments are the utility’s bread and butter.", "In a broad sense, the shift to renewables is good for such utilities. When they shift from existing fossil fuel plants to new renewable energy, they shift from fuel (coal and natural gas) costs, which they make no money on, to investments in new renewable energy power plants, new batteries to store power and electric car chargers to help electrify the vehicle fleet, and tons of new transmission lines, much of which they can rate-base.", "These goals (perhaps combined with a new, more stringent RPS in Colorado) will help Xcel get permission from regulators to depreciate lots of uneconomic old fossil-fuel assets (which activists have been hassling it about anyway) and build, build, build a bunch of new stuff.", "In short, Xcel stands to profit handsomely, and benefit politically, by giving its customers the clean energy they want.", "(Many ratepayer advocates worry that utilities like Duke are taking advantage of this dynamic, using clean energy as an excuse to build stuff that local, distributed energy could handle better — but that’s a different post.)", "A more interesting question is how this might affect Xcel’s monopoly status. On one hand, riding a political wave as a climate champion allows it to stay ahead of grumbling or desire for restructuring.", "On the other hand, Xcel suddenly needing so much clean energy might help grease the skids for regionalization, i.e., the creation of a restructured Western wholesale power market run by a regional transmission operator (RTO).", "If all of the West is heading toward decarbonization together, the region’s utilities will need to pool their resources.", "In fact, they might need to pool their resources rapidly, because the federal tax credits for wind and solar power are set to expire soon.", "Buying a lot of capacity before then could save a lot of money.", "Fifth — and this may be somewhat peripheral, but it’s interesting — on the very same day Xcel made its announcement, the Boulder City Council voted to move forward with creating a municipal utility and breaking off from Xcel.", "Xcel very much opposes that move. By ramping up its clean energy goals, it may not keep Boulder, but it could dissuade other similar-minded cities from following Boulder out the door.", "Anyway, the decision to go carbon-free by 2050 is not a selfless act on Xcel’s part — it sees which way the wind is blowing and is focused on providing returns for shareholders.", "And the announcement leaves many, many details unspecified, including plans to shut down fossil fuel plants and transition plans for affected communities.", "Nonetheless, it shows that incentives are beginning to align in a hopeful way.

It promised 100 percent carbon-free electricity.", "In this, it echoed California’s recent bill SB 100, which committed the state to 100 percent carbon-free energy by 2045.", "The difference is that carbon-free includes not only renewables but also advanced nuclear power plants and fossil fuel power plants with carbon capture and sequestration, either of which Xcel may end up needing to get to 100.", "The company believes that its 2030 goal can be achieved affordably with renewable energy and other technologies currently available.", "However, achieving the long-term vision of zero-carbon electricity requires technologies that are not cost effective or commercially available today.", "That is why Xcel Energy is committed to ongoing work to develop advanced technologies while putting the necessary policies in place to achieve this transition.", "Both sides of this message are incredibly important and poorly understood by the general public.", "First, we have a really good idea of how to get to 80 percent.

The report said that assuming historic trends, there will still be $460 million left in base rates in 2030, and $320 million in 2040 to be recovered."]}

The total return has averaged a very lumpy but fairly dependable 10 percent per year before inflation, 7 percent after inflation.", "5 of the 7 percent comes in the form of rising stock prices, and the other 2 comes from dividend payments directly from the company to you.", "When you’re in your ‘Stashing stage, you just let these dividends automatically reinvest in more stocks which creates a nice compounding effect.", "But WHICH stocks do I want to buy to make this free money?", "The best minds in finance have done countless studies on this for over 40 years. What they find is that the best way to make money in the stock market is to simply buy an “index fund”, which is a mutual fund that automatically buys appropriate ratios of every major stock in your country’s stock market, with no magic and guessing of which stocks are better than others.", "The reason the index fund wins statistically is because it can be run by a simple automated set of rules – no need to pay 350 million dollar salaries to the hotshot traders running the “Aggressive Growth Fund” down the street.", "Because there are millions of people, both smart and dumb, squabbling over the value of each stock, the Index Fund benefits and suffers from all the individual stock performances.", "But overall, you get the average performance of all this squabbling.", "If you descend into the pit and try some squabbling yourself, you may come out ahead or drastically behind the average, but as it turns out, you can’t predict in advance which squabblers (including yourself) will win and which will lose.", "All you can predict is that your average performance if you buy enough of these funds will be equal to the return of the market as a whole, minus the amount of fees your mutual fund charges.", "So by picking the index fund with the lowest fees, you automatically win.

The unit has broken down so often since it started operating in 2010 that it has been offline for a quarter of its life—extremely poor performance for a relatively new plant.", "And with each outage and subsequent repair, the cost of its power for Colorado ratepayers continues to spiral upward, making it a glaring example of how even the newest coal-fired power plants are losing the economic battle with ever-cheaper and cleaner utility-scale solar and wind.", "Comanche 3 should be shut decades before its planned 2070 closure", "The absence of the 750-megawatt (MW) unit and its failure to affect the steady delivery of electricity to customers adds to the argument that Comanche 3 should be shut decades before its planned 2070 closure.", "Another push for closure is coming from the state, which has a legislative mandate to cut greenhouse gas emissions by 90% by 2050.", "A key interim goal is cutting utility carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions by 80% by 2030.

Participants in these meetings acknowledged that Level 2 charging is favorable to fast charging because it generally requires less electricity at a particular moment in time and can be reasonably managed through time-varying rate designs.", "However, several stakeholders also noted that widespread public fast charging stations are a key consideration for consumers who are looking at buying an EV.", "In other words, while Level 2 charging has the greatest promise of providing benefits to the electric grid, those benefits depend on EV ownership and that partly depends on the perception of available public fast charging stations.", "In this case, by deploying multiple pilots as a package, Xcel Energy was able to address stakeholder interests in both types of charging infrastructure.", "Several participants in our stakeholder meetings made clear that they wanted Xcel Energy’s EV programs to be designed to incentivize charging behavior that doesn’t increase costs at peak times of electricity usage, instead incentivizing usage when renewables are producing power.", "In response to this, Xcel Energy offered a conventional two-part time-varying rate for all three of its EV pilots, with on-peak occurring from 9 a.m. to 9 p.m., and off-peak occurring from 9 p.m. to 9 a.m.", "This proposed rate design led to a two-part discussion that may be insightful to other utilities.", "First, some stakeholders wanted to see a more advanced rate design used for these pilots – one that would deploy more time periods (e.g., four time periods per day rather than two) to send more accurate price signals to customers.", "Notably, and as I’ve written about previously, Xcel Energy received approval for a more advanced residential time-varying rate design pilot in May of 2018, which has four electricity price changes in each day.", "Therefore, some stakeholders wanted to see this rate design deployed for the EV pilots. Second, for the public charging pilot, there was a concern that while the charging station owners (which, in Xcel Energy’s proposed design, will be third parties) would pay time-varying rates, the owners might not necessarily pass those rates on to the EV drivers using the charging stations, eliminating any charging behavior change that would have resulted.", "In response, the PUC allowed the conventional time-varying rate design to move forward in the interim but required Xcel Energy to come back with a more refined rate design for the fleet and public charging EV pilots within six months.", "For the public charging site hosts in particular, the PUC asked charging station operators to use time-varying rates by default, but allowed them to opt-out of doing so if warranted.", "In this particular case, the two-period time-varying rate proved unacceptable to both stakeholders and the commission.", "However, the fact that Xcel Energy had already completed some legwork to design a more advanced time-varying rate made it particularly hard to defend the two-part rate.", "Utilities developing EV programs should certainly be looking at time-varying rate designs, and, based on this experience, would do well to make the price signals in those rate designs as accurate as possible.", "Consumer impacts, including cost recovery for pilot expenses, were of significant concern in our stakeholder meetings, with some participants stressing the importance of ensuring the benefits of EV programs outweigh the costs for all customers, EV drivers and non-EV drivers alike.", "This also became a key point of discussion when the pilots were being considered by the PUC.", "The discussion centered on who should pay for the pilots, since EV infrastructure and services are in the interests of both the utility and ratepayers.", "Consumer advocates argued that, without an analysis showing the measurable benefits to all ratepayers, only the utility and participating customers should pay for the programs, as this is otherwise just a marketing initiative to sell more electricity to some customers at the expense of all.", "The Commission disagreed, stating that it asked the utilities to come forward with innovative EV pilot projects for several reasons in the public interest and this is an example of a utility following through on that request.", "Denying this request would send the wrong signal—that innovation is not rewarded. Therefore, they decided that all ratepayers should fund the pilots, as long as those expenses are shown by the utility to be reasonable and prudent.", "The Commission clarified that the decision applies only to the pilots and that one intended outcome is to gather information that can enable better cost-benefit analysis in the future.", "As part of this, they made the following decisions:", "- While the utility typically does not own and recover costs on infrastructure beyond a customer’s service connection, for the purposes of these pilots the Commission allowed Xcel Energy to classify wiring and charging equipment beyond the meter as part of their distribution system.", "- While customers benefitting from a new service line typically need to contribute to the costs of that line, for these specific pilots the Commission allowed those costs to be spread out across all ratepayers.", "- Finally, Xcel Energy is currently operating under a multi-year rate plan, which is intended to promote innovation by allowing the utility flexibility on costs over multiple years, but within certain pre-established limits.", "While some parties argued that costs for these pilots should count within those limits, Xcel Energy argued that these costs were unforeseen when the limits were established, and that they should be allowed to recover these costs beyond those limits.", "The Commission ultimately agreed, but suggested that Xcel Energy’s next multi-year rate plan should include a proposed research and development budget to avoid this happening again in the future.", "While the decisions made in this case may be unique to Xcel Energy and Minnesota, the broader lesson is that the costs and benefits of utility EV programs need to be thought through carefully, with specific attention to impacts on non-participants.", "In summary, utility EV programs offer a unique opportunity to create benefits for shareholders, consumers, and the environment, but they need to be implemented carefully and thoughtfully.", "Xcel Energy’s pilot programs in Minnesota show that finding a balance among the needs of diverse interests is difficult, but not impossible, and that that upfront stakeholder engagement can be a beneficial step towards ensuring that a utility’s final proposal is as close to acceptable as possible among the parties who will potentially advocate for or against it.", "UPDATE: There was a request submitted to the PUC to reconsider its order approving Xcel’s EV pilots. The request was denied and the denial is now being appealed.", "More information is available in MN PUC Docket 18-643."]}

Microarray studies of gene expression during multiple stages of HIV/SIV infection indicate modulation of LAG-3 expression [15,16]; LAG-3 transcript levels positively correlate with viral load set point and are significantly higher among rapid progressors compared to viremic non-progressors [17].", "In vitro, HIV-pulsed DCs can induce the expression of a number of exhaustion markers, including LAG-3, on T cells [18].", "Despite these observations, evidence of LAG-3 involvement in lymphocyte dysfunction during chronic infection remains elusive.", "With the exception of one report [19], early studies suggested that LAG-3 is not upregulated on bulk T cells during HIV infection [20].", "Recent characterization of HIV-specific T cells found that the major populations of exhausted HIV-specific CD8+ and CD4+ T cells lack LAG-3 expression [21,22].", "Although a recent study reported on a population of LAG-3+ HIV-specific CD8+ T cells associated with low viral loads, the authors were unable to detect LAG-3 expression on HIV-specific T cells prior to a 30 hour stimulation in vitro [23].", "Importantly, LAG-3 expression on non-T lymphocyte subsets during chronic HIV infection has not been assessed.", "In HIV infection, NK cells exhibit multiple functional defects [24,25] that persist during cART [26], as well as expansion of a dysfunctional CD56−CD16+ subset that expresses high levels of inhibitory receptors [27].", "The invariant NKT (iNKT) population is also affected by HIV infection. iNKTs are innate lymphocytes and a small subset of CD1d-restricted CD3+ lymphocytes that respond to lipid antigen stimulation with robust cytokine production and proliferation, creating a potent link between the innate and adaptive arms of the immune system.", "CD4+ iNKTs are depleted during chronic HIV infection [28,29] and exhibit variable reconstitution during ART [28,30,31].", "The bulk iNKT population displays also defects in IFNγ/TNFα secretion and proliferation [30,32-34]. The consequences of iNKT dysfunction or exhaustion during infection could be considerable due to the unique role of iNKT cells in linking, and directing, innate and adaptive immunity.", "A hallmark of iNKT activation is the rapid production of a vast array of cytokines and chemokines [35-37].", "Other iNKT effector functions include perforin/granzyme release associated with NKG2D engagement [38-42], and Fas/FasL-mediated cytotoxicity [36,39].", "In addition to direct cytolytic function and cytokine secretion, iNKTs play an important role in the activation and regulation of other immune cell subsets.", "iNKT activation reciprocally modulates DC function [43-45] and quickly leads to NK cell activation in an IFNγ-dependent manner, followed by T and B cell activation [46].", "Stimulation of iNKT cells in conjunction with soluble T cell antigen enhances both CD4+ and CD8+ antigen-specific responses [47,48].", "Consequently, loss of iNKT function can lead to significant defects in adaptive immunity. Data from non-human primate studies suggests that pre-infection iNKT frequency correlates with retention of CD4 count following SIV challenge, and supernatant from iNKT cultures is sufficient to inhibit HIV replication in vitro.", "To date, the determinants of iNKT dysfunction during HIV infection are poorly understood. In one study, the exhaustion marker PD-1, which contributes to loss of T cell function in HIV infection, was unrelated to iNKT dysfunction [30], but the role of other inhibitory receptors such as LAG-3 has not been assessed.", "In this context, several gaps in knowledge remain.

The aim of our cross-sectional study was to investigate the association between meal planning and diet quality, including adherence to nutritional guidelines and food variety, as well as weight status.", "Meal planning, i.e. planning ahead the foods that will be eaten for the next few days, was assessed in 40,554 participants of the web-based observational NutriNet-Santé study.", "Dietary measurements included intakes of energy, nutrients, food groups, and adherence to the French nutritional guidelines (mPNNS-GS) estimated through repeated 24-h dietary records.", "A food variety score was also calculated using Food Frequency Questionnaire. Weight and height were self-reported.", "Association between meal planning and dietary intakes were assessed using ANCOVAs, while associations with quartiles of mPNNS-GS scores, quartiles of food variety score and weight status categories (overweight, obesity) were evaluated using logistic regression models.", "A total of 57% of the participants declared to plan meals at least occasionally. Meal planners were more likely to have a higher mPNNS-GS (OR quartile 4 vs. 1 = 1.13, 95% CI: [1.07–1.20]), higher overall food variety (OR quartile 4 vs. 1 = 1.25, 95% CI: [1.18–1.32]).", "In women, meal planning was associated with lower odds of being overweight (OR = 0.92 [0.87–0.98]) and obese (OR = 0.79 [0.73–0.86]).", "In men, the association was significant for obesity only (OR = 0.81 [0.69–0.94]).", "Meal planning was associated with a healthier diet and less obesity. Although no causality can be inferred from the reported associations, these data suggest that meal planning could potentially be relevant for obesity prevention.", "In industrialized countries, eating habits and cooking practices have considerably changed. First, time devoted to cooking has decreased: in the United States, it has been reduced from 1:63 hour per day in 1965–1966 to 58 min in 2006–2007 [1].", "Additionally, the source of food consumed has changed: people consume less food prepared at home, whereas foods prepared away from home represent an increasing part of the diet", "In light of this observation, a number of studies have evaluated the potential impact of food prepared away from home on dietary quality, as well as weight status.", "These studies highlighted that the consumption of food prepared away from home is associated with a lower quality diet [5–8] and a higher body mass index [9–11], whereas benefits have been attributed to home-prepared food [2, 12–14].", "More frequent home food preparation has been associated with better adherence to dietary objectives [12], higher intakes of fruits, vegetables [13, 14], fiber, folate and vitamin A, while lower intakes of fat in young people [13].", "Therefore, home meal preparation has been increasingly promoted as a strategy for improving dietary quality and preventing obesity [12–15].", "In designing strategies to promote home cooking, it is important to understand the patterns and correlates of home meal practices.", "Many studies have investigated the reasons why people cook less. Time scarcity and cooking skills were identified as common barriers to prepare home meals [6, 11, 12, 16, 17].", "Previous research emphasized that individuals with lower cooking skills were more likely to consume away from home food such as ready meals or take-out meals from fast food or restaurants [11, 18].", "In response to these difficulties, a number of studies have evaluated the opportunity to improve cooking skills in order to promote healthy dietary patterns [19–21].", "To face time pressure, a series of qualitative studies highlighted that parents resort to food choice coping strategies, such as meal simplification, taking out, or meal planning [16, 17, 22–26] despite their potential impact on diet quality.", "Among these strategies, time management skills [27] and in particular meal planning [28, 29], which consists in deciding ahead the foods that will be eaten in the next few days, has been previously suggested as a solution to balance competing time demands and reduce barriers to healthy dietary practices.", "In the literature, very few studies have investigated meal planning practices and they often focused on adequate diet for diabetic subjects", "[30–32]. Studies performed on general populations showed that meal planning was positively associated with frequencies of home food preparation [29] and family meal [33], as well as the presence of fruits for dinner [34].", "To our knowledge, only one study in the literature has evaluated the potential link between meal planning and food consumption.", "It focused on fruit and vegetables specifically, and showed that planning meal ahead was associated with higher fruit and vegetable intakes [35].", "However, the latter presented weakness in the dietary intake assessment method since it consisted only of questions on the number of servings eaten per day.", "Additionally, meal planning was evaluated, among various practices, as a tool to maintain weight among successful weight losers [36, 37] but no data exists on the potential relationship with weight status in the general population.", "In the present study, we hypothesize that meal planning might encourage home meal preparation, and therefore have beneficial effects on dietary quality and consequently on weight status.", "Thus, we first described meal planning practices among a large sample of individuals. Then, we investigated the relationships between meal planning and diet quality, based on adherence to nutritional guidelines, energy, macronutrients and food group intakes, as well as food variety.", "Finally, we evaluated the association between meal planning and weight status.", "The NutriNet-Santé study (http://info.etude-nutrinet-sante.fr) is an ongoing web-based prospective observational cohort study launched in France in May 2009 with a scheduled follow-up of 10 years.", "It aims to investigate the relationship between nutrition and chronic disease risk, as well as the determinants of dietary behavior and nutritional status.", "The study was implemented in the French general population (internet-using adult volunteers, aged ≥18 years).", "The rationale, design and methodology of the study have been fully described elsewhere [38]. In brief, to be included into the study, participants have to complete a baseline set of self-administered web-based questionnaires assessing dietary intake, physical activity, anthropometric characteristics, lifestyle, socioeconomic conditions and health status.", "As part of the follow-up, participants are asked to complete the same set of questionnaires each year.", "Moreover, each month, participants are invited by e-mail to fill in optional questionnaires related to dietary intake, determinants of eating behaviors, nutritional and health status.", "This study is conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki, and all procedures were approved by the Institutional Review Board of the French Institute for Health and Medical Research (IRB Inserm n°0000388FWA00005831) and the Commission Nationale de l’Informatique et des Libertés (CNIL n°908450 and n°909216).", "All participants provided informed consent with an electronic signature. This study is registered in EudraCT (n°2013-000929-31).", "Meal planning practices were assessed via an optional questionnaire launched in the NutriNet-Santé cohort study in April 2014.", "First, grocery shopping and cooking practices were evaluated. In particular, participants were asked to indicate whether they were involved in grocery shopping (every day, several times a week, once a week, less than once a week) and cooking (every day twice a day, every day once a day, several times a week but not every day, once a week, less than once a week, never) in their household.", "Then, participants were asked the following question “Generally, when do you choose the foods you are going to eat for meal?”", "(just before meal, during the day, the day before, few days before, one week before, never). Participants responding “never” were exempted to complete the rest of the questionnaire.", "Participants were also asked whether having to think about what they have to cook is a constraint for them.", "The responses were rated on a 5-point Likert scale ranging from one (strongly disagree) to five (strongly agree).", "Participants were then asked whether they planned meals, even in an irregular manner (yes I do, yes I did but not anymore, no I never planned meals).", "The definition of “planning meals” given to the participants was “to plan ahead the foods that will be eaten for the next few days”.", "Participants who reported planning meal currently were considered as “meal planners” whereas others were categorized as “non-meal planners”.", "Finally, the questionnaire included questions about meal planning frequency (several times a week, once a week, once every two weeks, two to three times a month, not regularly), duration (a few days, one week, two weeks or more), period of the week (weekdays, weekend, weekdays and weekend) and sources of inspiration (personal recipe repertoire, Internet or apps, ingredients available during grocery shopping).", "At baseline and annually thereafter, participants in the NutriNet-Santé study are asked to provide socio-demographic data, including sex, age (18–30, 30–50, 50–65, >65 years), educational level (up to secondary, some college or university degree), monthly income (<1,200 €, 1,200–1,800 €, 1,800–2,700 € and >2,700 € per consumption unit), presence of children in the household (yes, no), history of dieting to lose weight during the past year (yes, no) and physical activity (low, moderate, high).", "Monthly household income is calculated per “consumption unit” (CU), where one CU is attributed for the first adult in the household, 0.5 CU for other persons aged 14 or older, and 0.3 CU for children under 14, following national statistics methodology and guidelines [39].", "Physical activity was assessed using a short form of the French version of the International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ).", "The weekly energy expenditure expressed in metabolic equivalent task minutes per week was estimated, and three scores of physical activity were constituted [i.e., low (<30 min/day), moderate (30–59 min/day), and high (≥60 min/day)]", "according to the French guidelines for physical activity [40].", "For the present study, we used the closest available data with respect to the assessment of meal planning practices.", "At inclusion and once a year thereafter, participants are invited to complete three non-consecutive 24-h dietary records, randomly assigned over a 2-week period (two weekdays and one weekend day).", "For the present analysis, we selected participants who completed at least three 24-h dietary records since their inclusion in the cohort study (i.e. completed between May 2009 and December 2014).", "Participants reported all foods and beverages consumed at each eating occasion. They estimated the amounts eaten using validated photographs of portion sizes [41], using household measures or by indicating the exact quantity (grams) or volume (milliliters).", "Daily mean food intakes were calculated, weighted for the type of day of the week. Energy, nutrient and food group intakes were estimated using the NutriNet-Santé composition table including more than 2000 foods [42].", "Dietary underreporting was identified on the basis of the method proposed by Black [43]. We hypothesize that meal planning encourages food preparation and therefore considered food groups that can be used in food preparation (e.g. eggs).", "In addition, we considered food groups that have nutritional interest (e.g. fruits). Thus, the following food groups were included in the study: fruits, vegetables, fish (including seafood and processed seafood), meat (including cooked ham, offal), eggs, milk, cheese, added fats (including oil, butter, margarine, vinaigrette), sugary products (e.g. cake, biscuits, sugars, honey, jam, chocolate) and starchy foods (including potato, legumes, pasta, rice, other cereals) with a specific focus on legumes and whole grain starchy foods (including whole grain pasta, rice, other cereals).", "Adherence to nutritional guidelines was assessed using the PNNS Guideline Score (PNNS-GS). The 15-point PNNS-GS is a validated a priori score reflecting the adherence to the official French nutritional guidelines which has been extensively described elsewhere [44].", "Details on computation of this score are in Additional file 1. Briefly, it includes 13 components: eight refer to food-serving recommendations (fruit and vegetables; starchy foods; whole grain products; dairy products; meat, eggs and fish; fish and seafood; vegetable fat; water vs. soda), four refer to moderation in consumption (added fat; salt; sweets; alcohol) and one component pertains to physical activity [44, 45].", "Points are deducted for overconsumption of salt (>12 g/day), added sugars (>17.5% of energy intake), or when energy intake exceeds the needed energy level by more than 5%.", "Each component cut-off was that of the threshold defined by the PNNS public health objectives when available [45] otherwise they were established according to the French Recommended Dietary Allowances [46].", "For the present analysis, we consider the mPNNS-GS, a modified version of the PNNS-GS, which takes into account only the dietary components, therefore excluding the physical activity component.", "Food variety has been defined as the number of different food items reported to be eaten over a given reference period [47].", "Considering that seasonality is likely to influence food variety and that a period of 10 to 15 days has been recommended to accurately assess food variety [48], the food variety was evaluated using a Food Frequency Questionnaire (FFQ).", "Sixteen months after baseline, participants were invited to complete a self-administrated 240-items FFQ to assess their usual dietary intake over the past year [49].", "Participants were asked to report their consumption frequency on the basis of how many times they ate the standard portion size proposed (typical household measurements such as spoon or standard unit such as a yogurt).", "The frequency of consumption referred to usual consumption over the past year on an increasing scale including yearly, monthly, weekly or daily units, as suitable, and participants were asked to provide only one answer.", "The food variety score corresponded to the number of FFQ items reported to be consumed at least once during the last year [47].", "The maximum score was therefore 240. Fruit and vegetable variety scores were also computed based on the number of different fruits and vegetables reported by the participants.", "Height and weight were assessed by using an anthropometric questionnaire, which was self-administered online, at baseline and each year thereafter [50, 51].", "For each participant, the closest available data to the meal planning questionnaire were used for the analysis.", "Data were not collected for pregnant women. BMI (in kg/m2) was calculated as the ratio of weight to squared height.", "Participants were classified as underweight or normal weight (BMI < 25), overweight (25 ≤ BMI < 30) and obesity (BMI ≥ 30) according to WHO references values [52].", "The analysis focused on participants who had completed the meal planning questionnaire, had declared being involved in meal preparation in their household, and who had completed at least three 24-h dietary records since they were included in the study, as well as the FFQ.", "Chi-square tests and Student’s t tests were used to compare characteristics of included vs. excluded participants, as well as meal planners vs. non-meal planners.", "Meal planners’ practices were also described. Continuous variables are presented as means ± SDs and categorical variables as percentages.", "ANCOVAs were performed to investigate the relationship between meal planning and energy, macronutrients and food groups.", "However, for some particular food groups which did not exhibit normal distribution (i.e. eggs, milk, legumes, and whole grain starchy foods), mainly due to a high proportion of non-consumers, a binary variable (consumer/non-consumer) was created and a logistic regression analysis was performed.", "Logistic regression models were also used to assess the associations between meal planning and quartiles of mPNNS-GS, as well as quartiles of food variety scores (overall, fruit and vegetable) and BMI categories.", "Due to significant interactions and differences on the associations with meal planning, analyses on BMI were performed separately by sex.", "Meal planning has been described as a cooking skill [53]. Thus, characteristics that have been shown to influence cooking practices, dietary intakes or weight status were considered as confounders in the present analyses.", "Models were therefore all adjusted for sex [1, 54, 55], age [56], educational level, monthly income [6], presence of children in the household [6], history of dieting to lose weight during the past year [57], physical activity [58], and cooking frequency.", "Models evaluating the associations with mPNNS-GS, macronutrient and food groups intakes were further adjusted for daily energy intake and number of 24-h dietary records completed by participants.", "The energy model was only adjusted on the number of 24-h records while the food variety models were adjusted on daily energy intake.", "Missing covariate data were imputed using multiple imputation method.", "Sensitivity analyses were conducted on a subsample of individuals having responded to at least one of the dietary assessments (i.e. FFQ, dietary records).", "In addition, analyses were conducted using another definition of food variety score (number of FFQ items reported to be consumed more than once a week)", "All tests of statistical significance were two-sided and the type I error was set at 5%.

The majority of non-meal planners decided what food to prepare during the day or just before meal whereas meal planners reported to decide during the day, the day before or few days before.", "Finally, thinking about what food to prepare was less of a constraint for meal planners than for non-meal planners (all P < 0.0001).", "Results among meal planners more specifically showed that the majority of participants planned their meals at least once a week.", "A non-negligible part (14.8%) also reported to plan meals not regularly. Three-quarters of participants planned meals for a few days, but less than a week.", "Meals were mostly planned for both weekdays and weekend.

Generally, individuals planned their meals several times a week, for a few days period including weekdays and weekend, and get inspiration mostly from their personal recipe repertoire or ingredients available during grocery shopping.", "A previous survey evaluating Canadians’ attitudes and habits with regard to home food preparation highlighted that about 40% of the participants decide what they will prepare for dinner during the day, 27% the day before and 33% at least two days before [29].", "However, the latter did not explore the modalities of meal planning.", "Based on a large sample of general population, our data support the notion that planning meal is indeed associated with a better adherence to nutritional guidelines and an increased food variety (overall, fruits and vegetables).", "However, it should be noted that only small differences were observed with energy, macronutrient and food group intakes specifically.", "Although meal planning has been previously suggested as a potential tool to improve dietary quality [28, 29], to our knowledge, no study in the literature has investigated this related association.", "Previous authors highlighted that individuals deciding in advance what to prepare for dinner were more likely to cook homemade dishes [29].", "Since more frequent food preparation has been linked with a better diet quality [12–14], this could potentially explain the healthier diet observed in meal planners.", "A few hypotheses can be made on how meal planning could encourage home food preparation. First, meal planning might address the issue of not knowing what to prepare for dinner, that has been previously described as a barrier for home meal preparation [29].", "Second, by planning meals individuals may think about recipes that can be prepared in a limited period of time and, therefore reduce the feeling of time scarcity, that may limit home meal preparation", "[6, 12, 16] and increase the recourse to food choice coping strategies such as eating out, delivery meals or ready prepared food", "[17, 23–25]. In addition, planning meals may reduce the risk of missing ingredients for home meal preparation which could also lead to the consumption of food prepared away from home.", "Finally, deciding what foods will be eaten in the next few days could also enable individuals to cook more diversified recipes and to anticipate grocery shopping for the specific ingredients needed, thus potentially explaining the increased food variety observed in meal planners.", "However, reverse causality cannot be excluded since individuals interested in having a healthy diet might be more likely to plan their meals.", "In line with this idea, meal-planners in our sample were more likely to have higher educational level, to have higher income, to be physically active and to have a lower BMI, characteristics that have been related with a better attitude towards healthy eating [61].", "Our results showed that women who planned meals were less likely to be overweight or obese, while in men, there was an association with obesity only.", "Since meal planners have a diet of higher quality, it potentially prevents overweight in these individuals [52].", "However, we cannot exclude reverse causality. People attaching more importance to food and weight management might be more likely to plan their meals.", "In line with this hypothesis, two studies in the literature highlighted that meal planning is more frequently used by successful weight loss maintainers compared to those who did not maintain weight losses [36, 37].", "In terms of public health, our results bring supportive insights that promoting meal planning might encourage the preparation of healthier and more varied home meals.", "Previous studies showed that parents would be interested in learning how to plan meals [28, 60], however, other findings suggested that meal planning is also perceived as complex and time consuming [62].", "Specific tools might assist people in managing meal planning but to be adopted and sustainable over time, it is important to identify consumers’ needs.", "The present data highlighted that there are various ways of planning meals. As an example, we observed that the ingredients available during grocery shopping are likely to influence meal planning while existing tools rather propose menus to plan grocery shopping.", "A major strength of this study was its large sample size allowing an evaluation of meal planning practices at a population level.", "The wide range of socio-economic and lifestyle variables collected through the web-based platform enables the control of potential effects of confounding factors.", "In addition, the web-based tool used to assess 24-h dietary records has shown a good validity in prior studies [63, 64].", "However, because of the influence of seasonality on food variety, the FFQ was used to evaluate dietary variety since it allows usual intake estimates over a relatively long period of time [65].", "This study was also subject to several limitations. First, the cross-sectional design of this study prevented any inference of causality.", "Moreover, since participants were volunteers in a nutrition focused cohort, they may have higher health consciousness and interest in nutritional issues.", "The fact that we selected only participants who completed both dietary assessment tools might have exacerbated this characteristic in our sample.", "Therefore, caution is needed when generalizing our results. However, sensitivity analyses including individuals with at least one of the dietary assessments (24-h dietary records or FFQ) revealed similar trends.", "Besides, the fact that participants had relatively high knowledge in nutrition could potentially account for the few differences observed in energy and food group intakes, since they may be able to cook healthful meals without planning meals.", "It is also important to consider that food variety score was based on FFQ data, which has been recorded at different time frames (16 months after the inclusion in the cohort).", "Thus, for participants included since a long time in the cohort study, the estimation may not represent their current dietary repertoire.", "In addition, data were self-reported, thus potentially leading to misreporting due, for example, to desirability bias.", "Nonetheless, previous validation studies performed on a subsample of the NutriNet-Santé study have supported the good validity of self-reported anthropometric and dietary data [63, 64, 66].", "Finally, given that meal planning may be influenced by numerous parameters such as cooking practices and food availability in the surrounding, it is possible that some factors mediating the associations observed in the present paper were not taken into account in the analyses.", "The potential impact of cooking practices was however considered by adding cooking frequency as a confounder.", "Future research should be conducted to address the issue of how food availability could potentially influence the relationship observed between meal planning and diet quality.", "Our results highlighted that individuals planning their meals were more likely to have a better dietary quality, including a higher adherence with nutritional guidelines as well as an increased food variety.", "Additionally, meal planning was associated with lower odds of being obese in men and women and overweight in women only.", "Although interventional or prospective research should be conducted in order to infer causality, these data suggest the potential interest of promoting meal planning to improve dietary quality and prevent overweight.", "Such a tool could partly address the issue of time scarcity reported by consumers for meal preparation and, might therefore encourage home cooking.", "Given the potential benefits of meal planning identified in this study, it would be interesting that future research evaluate the appropriation and the impact of applications designed to help individuals planning their meals.", "Modified Programme National Nutrition Santé-Guideline Score", "Smith LP, Ng SW, Popkin BM.

The wounded men were taken", "to the Marine Hospital, in Norfolk, where one of them died. Intense", "indignation prevailed in the city. It was believed that the outrage", "was deliberately designed, and the cry for vengeance burst from the", "whole people. In full assembly, with the venerable General Matthews", "presiding, they appointed, as in the days of '76, a Committee of Safety.", "A preamble, duly setting forth the outrage on the \"Chesapeake,\" was", "adopted, and it was resolved that there should be no intercourse with", "the British frigates in the Norfolk waters, or with their agents, until", "the decision of the United States Government was known, under the", "penalty of being deemed infamous; and the Committee of Safety—", "Thomas Matthews, Thomas Newton, Jr., Luke Wheeler, Theodric", "Armistead, Richard E. Lee, Moses Myers, William Pennock, William", "Newsum, Thomas Blanchard, Daniel Bedinger, Seth Foster, J. W.", "Murdaugh, Richard Blow, and Francis S. Taylor—were authorized to", "take such measures as the emergency demanded. As soon as the British", "commander—Commodore Douglas—read the resolves, he addressed,", "on the 3d of July, an insolent letter to the Mayor of the Borough, in", "which he declared if the resolutions were not instantly annulled, he would", "prohibit every vessel bound in or out of Norfolk from proceeding to", "her place of destination. He closed his communication by saying that", "he had proceeded with his squadron of four fifty-gun frigates to Hampton", "Roads to await the answer of the Mayor, which he hoped would be", "forwarded without delay. It is thought that Mr. Tazewell had regulated", "the popular proceedings from their initiation. In the delicate dilemma,", "which was ominous of vengeful deeds and of so much menace to the", "commercial interests of Norfolk, he came to the assistance of the Mayor", "and dictated a reply to the audacious Briton which elicited the admiration", "of the whole American Nation. The letter, written on the 4th of", "The day on which this answer is written ought of itself to prove to", "the subjects of your sovereign that the American people are not to be", "imtimidated by menace; or induced to adopt any measures except by", "a sense of their perfect propriety.

It had a due effect.", "The threats were all recanted, and a letter of the 5th of July breathed", "nothing but amity and peace—an amusing somersault, like unto which is", "scarcely to be recalled in the annals of diplomacy.", "In 1816, during an absence from home, and without his knowledge,", "Mr. Tazewell was elected by the people of Norfolk to the House of Delegates.", "His speech in that body against the Convention bill, and in", "reply to General Alexander Smyth, is memorable for its ability and eloquence.", "The bill passed in the House but was lost in the Senate. In", "1820 Mr. Tazewell was one of the Commissioners under the Florida", "treaty. In 1824 he was elected to the United States Senate. He was", "elected to fill a vacancy caused by the resignation of John Taylor of", "Caroline. It is a coincidence that his father, thirty years before, was", "chosen to fill the vacancy in the Senate caused by the resignation of the", "same individual. L. W.

Mr. Tazewell was also, in 1829,", "tendered the mission to Great Britain, but declined the honor. He", "continued in the Senate until 1833, serving as Chairman of the Committee", "on Foreign Relations, and as President pro tem. of the body during", "a portion of the twenty-second Congress.

Mr. Tazewell", "was never afterwards in public service. Though so effective with", "juries as an advocate, his style of address is said to have been singularly", "simple and free from artifice. His arguments were conversational and", "his gestures not more striking than those of animated converse. His", "postures were negligent. His voice was pleasant and of ample compass.", "He was never vociferous. His logic was consummate, and in putting", "his arguments before a jury he exhibited great adroitness. He acquainted", "himself with the calling or prejudices of every juryman—and", "When the passions were to be assailed he indulged in a style of fervid", "appeal, which was the more effective as it was rare.

He was, without exception, in middle life, the most imposing,", "and in old age, the most venerable person I ever beheld. His", "height exceeded six feet. * * * His head and chest were on a large", "scale, and his vast blue eye, which always seemed to gaze afar, was aptly", "handsome.

Nunn went before the Westinghouse board in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, personally, to request the necessary equipment to construct an ac power plant and transmission line.", "At that time, it was a risky venture, with no track record from which to judge.", "Nunn made Westinghouse a bold proposal: US$50,000 in gold for US$50,000 worth of his time and experience to build an ac generator and a 100-hp motor to run the mine machinery.", "George Westinghouse viewed the proposal optimistically, understanding that success of the project could serve as positive proof of the superiority of his ac system.", "Westinghouse reasoned that if an ac system could send power over a remote section of the mighty Rocky Mountains, it could work anywhere.", "The project was a go, with Westinghouse providing the equipment and engineering assistance (see “L.L. Nunn”).", "AIEE Past President Lewis B. Stillwell recalled L.L. Nunn in a speech presenting the 1929 AIEE Edison Medal to AIEE Past President Charles F. Scott:", "“In 1890 a man [L.L. Nunn] from the west came east with a definite power transmission problem. His company was operating a stamp mill in the mountains of Colorado.", "Fuel was expensive, and three miles from the mill was adequate water power. The man from the west wanted to know whether electricity could transmit one hundred horsepower a distance of three miles and replace the steam plant he was using.", "After investigating the possibilities of 220-volt direct current transmission and satisfying himself that the amount of copper required would be prohibitive, he visited Pittsburgh.", "The officers of the Westinghouse Company were induced to authorize a contract, and early in 1891, near Telluride, Colorado, the first alternating power transmission plant in America began operation.”", "The name Ames came from a small settlement that existed at the confluence of the Howard Fork and Lake Fork streams, which in turn formed the San Miguel River.", "The plant consisted of a wooden shack located 2,000 ft (610 m) below the Gold King Mine, which was at an elevation of 12,000 ft (3,658 m) (see Figure 5).", "A continuous supply of water was provided by the waters of the Howard and Lake Fork streams and a system of natural reservoirs above the plant.", "The water was transported to the plant with a head of 320 ft (97.5 m) through a 2-ft (0.61-m) diameter steel pipe, to a 6-ft (1.83-m) Pelton water wheel.", "In the summer of 1890, Westinghouse sent two identical 100-hp, 3,000-V, single-phase 133-Hz ac generators (accompanied by additional materials) to Nunn at Telluride (see Figures 6 and 7).", "The system was designed with one unit utilized as the generator at Ames and the other as a motor at the Gold King Mine (see Figure 8).", "The generator at the Ames plant was separately excited, while the motor at the Gold King Mine was self-exciting (see Figure 9).", "The rudimentary switchboard was made with shellacked pine wood, upon which the crude measuring instruments and disconnects were mounted.", "The voltmeters and ammeters were of both solenoid and gravity-balance type, mounted in black walnut wooden boxes with glass covers.", "The line to the Gold King Mine was approximately 3-mi (4.83-km) long and was constructed using poles approximately 30-ft (9.1-m) long with Western Union telegraph-style crossarms, wood pins, and glass insulators.", "Two no. 3 bare-copper wires were installed over the entire line. The cost of the conductors was about US$700, about 1–2% of the cost of the larger copper conductors that would have been necessary if a dc system had been selected.", "The main motor at the Gold King Mine was brought to synchronous speed by a single-phase induction motor, which received full line voltage.", "Synchronizing lamps were utilized to assist with synchronization. Circuits were closed with blade-type switches and opened with arc-light plugs.", "Operating the plant was a hazardous endeavor, and it was a rule that operators always keep one hand in their pocket when using the other (see Figure 10).", "Nunn hired students from Cornell University to help construct and operate the Ames power plant, along with the line to the Gold King Mine.", "On 19 June 1891, water from the San Miguel River was unleashed onto the 6-ft (1.83-m) Pelton water wheel.", "The wheel was attached by belt to the Westinghouse generator, whose armature began to rotate as the water wheel turned.", "The ac produced by the rotating armature was transmitted 3 mi (4.83 km) to successfully operate the 40-stamp ore crushing mill at the Gold King Mine.", "This was arguably the first use of ac for industrial use in the United States.", "The plant ran continuously for 30 days without any problems. It became an entertaining event for the local citizens to go out to the Ames plant and observe it in operation.", "A common question asked by spectators was “How long does the electricity take to get to the Gold King Mine?”", "If fortunate with their timing, spectators could observe some of the 6–8-ft (1.83-m to 2.44-m) vicious arcs drawn when the circuit was opened.", "Another serious challenge for these early pioneers was the lightning activity that frequently occurred at this altitude, causing damage to the equipment.", "It was not uncommon for workers to spend painstaking hours replacing generator or motor coils damaged by lightning surges.", "Fortunately, the design of the generator and motor was such that the armature windings were segmented into removable coils that could be replaced individually when damaged.", "During summer months, it was standard operating procedure upon the approach of a thunderstorm to lay out, ready for instant use, an extra armature coil, together with all the tools for immediate replacement.", "One of the first lightning-protection measures involved raising the generator and motor and placing insulated platforms made of 4-in2 (10.2-cm2) oak boiled in paraffin for added insulation underneath them.", "In addition, a variety of trial-and-error lightning arrester designs (mostly utilizing choke coils) were experimented with (see Figure 11).", "Alexander J. Wurts of the Westinghouse Electric Company ultimately came up with a nonarcing metal arrester design that, for the most part, protected the equipment until more effective arresters were developed.", "A problem that developed in the infancy of hydroelectric power generation was the lack of a reliable governor that was sensitive and responsive to insure a constant speed.", "At the Ames plant and other very early plants, the “one-man automatic regulator method” had to be used.", "This method required the operator to sit with his hand on the lever of the deflecting nozzle and his eye continually observing the voltmeter or tachometer.", "He would make adjustments as necessary to maintain the proper rotation and frequency. This method was soon replaced with an automated version developed by the Westinghouse Company.", "In 1895, L.L. Nunn (now general manager of the Telluride Power Company) recognized the need for more research and development regarding longer-distance power transmission.", "Nunn knew that, in many cases, the source of hydroelectric power would be located much farther from where the power was needed than in the case of the Ames plant.", "This would obviously require higher voltage levels than had been experienced to date. To that end, he made arrangements with the Westinghouse Electric Company to host a joint research project using his system at Telluride.", "The general plan was to utilize the power source of the Ames plant and line to the Gold King Mine for various experiments at high voltages.", "It was determined that the research project should focus on line losses, voltage drop, corona discharge, and general insulator performance.", "As a secondary objective, the performance of various styles of lightning arresters would take place as opportunities presented themselves.", "The project would be directed by noted engineers V.G. Converse, Ralph D. Mershon, and Charles F. Scott.", "The line consisted of 62 poles, with each pole having three crossarms supporting three single-phase circuits, with equal spacing between conductors on all three crossarms.", "The distance between conductors varied during testing but was always be the same for all three circuits.", "Three different pin-type insulators were utilized for comparison during testing. The glass Pomona insulator was supplied by the Westinghouse Electric Company, so named for its prior use on the historic 1892 10,000-V transmission line from the Pomona hydroelectric plant to San Bernardino, California.", "Another smaller glass insulator was furnished by the Locke Insulator Company of Victor, New York, a pioneer in high-voltage insulator design and manufacturing.", "The General Electric Company supplied the only porcelain insulator used, a dry-process, white-colored unit used on several early lines.", "Each crossarm supported two of the same pin-type insulators, used to name the circuits: the General Electric circuit, Locke circuit, and Pomona circuit (see Figures 12–14).", "The Pomona insulator shown in Figure 13 is quite rare and highly sought after by insulator collectors, bringing upwards of US$10,000 when available for sale.", "In the 1960s, an employee of the Hemingray Glass Company in Muncie, Indiana, who was an insulator collector did some digging at the factory dump.", "On one dig, he found a cache of unusual insulators, including the one shown in Figure 14. The embossing on the front of the skirt reads: “WESTINGHOUSE ELECTRIC & M’F’G CO./ PITTSBURGH, PA” and on the rear: “TELLURIDE TYPE C.SB.”", "It would seem that this insulator was made for some test or application for the Telluride Power Company that never occurred.", "Initially, all three circuits had no. 8 Birmingham wire gauge (B.W.G.) galvanized iron wire installed.", "During the test period, the General Electric circuit was reconductored with no. 6 Brown & Sharpe (B&S) copper wire.", "This arrangement allowed the test circuits to be energized at different voltage levels for different periods of time and weather conditions.", "The visual observance of insulator performance and corona discharge at night was part of the testing procedure.", "Transformers were the key element of the experiment, as the ability to create different voltage levels was of paramount importance.", "The transformer arrangement consisted of two main transformers: one for raising generator voltage and the other for reducing voltage for the motor (see Figure 15).", "The high and low voltage windings were divided into individual coils that, by changing connections, allowed both the high and low voltages to be adjusted.", "This allowed the range of voltages for testing to be between 3,000 V and 60,000 V.", "A variety of wattmeters, ammeters, voltmeters, and instrument transformers were utilized to measure the watt loss of the lines (see Figure 16).", "Various schemes and connections were tried in an effort to find the most accurate method. The majority of testing was conducted on the low-tension side of the main transformers, with the lines open ended at the Gold King Mine.", "Compensations were made for various transformer losses when necessary so they wouldn’t be included in the line-loss measurements.", "The line losses obtained were a combination of those occurring between the conductors, leakage from the insulators, and resistance of the conductors.", "The first testing was done without any attempt at measurement, since the participants were unsure what would happen to the line and equipment at these higher voltages.", "After the initial excitement and uncertainty, the remainder of the testing was conducted in a more planned and structured manner.", "The line would be energized for different periods of time at different voltages, from 3,000 V to 60,000 V.", "The spacing between conductors was also changed for certain tests. Various measurements and observances of the insulators would be made at each test voltage.", "Notations regarding weather conditions were also made and correlated with the measurements.", "Near the conclusion of testing, the participants decided to stage one grand final test by taking the voltage level up to 133,000 V. To set the test up, they removed a span of conductor from the Pomona and General Electric circuits, leaving a short line of 500 ft (152 m) from the power house to the end of the line.", "The voltage was run up to 110,000 V, held for a short period, and then increased to 133,000 V. The voltage was held for several minutes until the current jumped from the terminals of the transformers to the iron case, shutting down the plant.", "Apparently, it was quite a show, providing some anxious moments for the awestruck participants.", "One of the test objectives was to compare and determine losses between differently spaced conductors.", "Numerous tests were conducted with the following horizontal conductor spacing: 15 in, (38.1 cm), 22 in (55.9 cm), 35 in (88.9 cm), and 52 in (132.1 cm).", "The test results were graphed with curves (see Figure 17). As the graph indicates, engineers confirmed that line losses decreased when the distance between conductors was increased.", "Another focal point of the watts-loss tests was to determine the influence of varying weather conditions on line loss.", "A series of weather recordings were made at the Ames plant and Gold King Mine of the following elements, each day over a 33-day period: barometric pressure, temperature, humidity, wind direction, and wind velocity.", "It was concluded that line losses between conductors are not affected by weather conditions, with the exception of precipitation, which did increase line losses.", "Insulators were observed during the day and night at various voltages. Corona discharges occurring as voltages increased were observed and noted.", "Mershon concluded that there was no advantage to porcelain over glass, unless it was a slight increase in mechanical strength.", "He summarized that glass insulators were cheaper, lighter, more easily tested and less likely to be shot at than porcelain.", "His theory on gunshot vandalism was that the white porcelain provided a more tempting target than the green glass.", "Different lightning arresters and choke coils at line terminals were also the subject of experimentation.", "Up to that point, almost all theories of transmission line operation had been predicated upon studies with minimum testing conducted in laboratories.", "Based on these new tests, Mershon concluded that 40,000 V was a perfectly conservative operating voltage to be utilized on properly designed lines in the future.", "This clearly led to elevation of transmission voltages, as the Telluride Power Company would later construct a line in Utah operated at—you guessed it—40,000 V.", "The success of the initial installation at the Ames plant led to expansion of the system to other fuel-depressed mines in the Telluride area.", "The Telluride Power Company was officially established around 1895, with L.L. Nunn as general manager and his brother Paul N. Nunn as chief engineer.", "Westinghouse had gone on to develop the Tesla system, which vastly improved the efficiency of electric power for mining with a three-phase system of generators, transformers, and motors.", "In 1896, Nunn had the Ames plant completely rebuilt with a new three-phase system supplied by a pair of two-phase generators directly connected to the Pelton-style water wheels, which were supplied by an increased flow of water from a newly designed storage dam and penstock system.", "Twelve 100-kW generator step-up transformers were connected to convert the generated two-phase power to three-phase power, elevating voltage to 10,000 V for transmission to various mines.", "With a transmission voltage of 10,000 V, the Telluride Power Company now had the potential to serve mines upwards of 20 mi (32.2 km) from Ames.", "A majority of these mines were located to the northeast of Telluride, in the high mountain areas. This formidable obstacle did not stop these pioneers as they proceeded to extend lines to several mines, including the famous Camp Bird Mine.", "Extending the system to mines in this area meant the lines would have to traverse mountains at elevations up to 13,000 ft (3,962 m), where severe weather (including snowstorms, avalanches, winds and ice) was commonplace.", "As plans for expansion were in progress, it became obvious that, to avoid damage from heavy snows and avalanches, long-span construction eliminating the need for poles along the sides of the steep mountains would be the best design (see Figure 18).", "It would require deadend structures with adequate strength to be designed and constructed. In addition, a method of deadending the conductors would need to be developed, since strain insulators as we know them today had not been invented.", "To meet this challenge, multipole structures were designed and situated at key points on ridge tops where conductors could be deadended.", "The longest span was 1,100 ft. (335 m), constructed with no. 1 copper conductor supported by a 0.5-in (1.3-cm) plow steel messenger.", "The attachment of conductors was achieved with a unique inline crossarm arrangement attached to the structure with a large hinge-type bracket.", "The crossarm had 12 pin-type insulators mounted on wood pins, equally spaced in a row with the conductors, attached in a manner that distributed the strain equally between each insulator, a classic example of the foresight and innovation demonstrated by these early pioneers (see Figures 19 and 20).", "The original Telluride power line hinged crossarm shown in Figure 20 was found sticking out of a snowdrift high in the San Juan Mountains by Christian Buys, author of Historic Telluride in Rare Photographs.", "After seeing a photograph in the book, the author was able to arrange a trade, and the crossarm is now on permanent display at the Meridian, Idaho, campus of Northwest Lineman College.", "Construction of the lines was a backbreaking manual effort, aided by teams of mules used to transport materials, tools, and supplies.", "Mules were also used for stringing the conductors and bringing them up to tension.", "The maintenance and operation of these lines provided further significant challenges, as access to the lines was difficult, with heavy snows blanketing the area for several months (see Figure 21).", "Wisely, switching stations were established at key line junctions, where faulted sections of line could be isolated and service restored to the remainder of the system (see Figure 22).", "The design of the switching junction shown in Figure 22 featured a sliding wooden rack with insulators and contacts that was operated from an insulated platform.", "As was typical during these early years, the design was homemade, developed via trial and error. In this phase of expansion, the Telluride Power Company gained valuable experience in constructing and maintaining lines in the mountains.", "Thinking about the pioneering days of the Telluride Power Company, one can only imagine how it must have been for these early pioneers, confronted with extinguishing electric arcs, fires, lightning, blizzards, ice avalanches, and –40 °F temperatures.", "To construct and operate a power system under these conditions with no experience is nothing short of amazing.", "The one element that was beyond the scope of this article, but equally innovative and important, was how the company conducted the training and education of its employees.", "Once the Telluride Power Company completed a successful power system in the Telluride area, it immediately looked for other areas to expand the company’s operation as there was now considerable experience to draw from and a significant number of well-trained employees.", "They would continue to develop methods, materials, and procedures that would be marveled at by other companies.", "By 1905, the Telluride Power Company would own and operate six power stations and nearly 1,000 mi (1,609 km) of high-voltage transmission lines in Colorado, Utah, Idaho, and Montana.", "I plan to write a sequel that will cover the expansion of the Telluride Power System, along with the special training and education system that was developed.", "A trip to the San Juan Mountains and the Telluride area offers a multitude of recreational activities, in areas with breathtaking scenery.", "Mining and railroad history are everywhere, along with the Telluride Power Company. The Ames power plant has been upgraded over the years and remains in operation by its current owner, Xcel Energy.", "The plant can easily be driven to, with interesting interpretive signs along the way. The local Telluride Museum has a nice display on the power system.", "The town of Telluride has not forgotten its legacy of being a pioneer in the development of the electric power industry.", "Northwest Lineman College has an in-depth display of the Telluride Power Company in the lobby of the Idaho campus, which features a mural of the Ames Plant and the line to the Gold King Mine along with photographs and artifacts from the line (see Figure 23).", "The college maintains a strong commitment to promoting an understanding of the historical evolution of the power industry.", "We include “a look back” in our training programs as we want our students to understand how we got where we are.", "Readers are encouraged to visit the campus if they are visiting the Boise, Idaho, area.", "In conclusion, it seems appropriate to reflect on a statement made in the Annual Report of the Treasury of the United States in 1901:", "For the growth of the mining industry, San Miguel County is indebted to the Telluride Power Company more than to any other agency, which is borne out by the fact that at the present time all of the important mines and mills of the district are operated by power furnished by this company.", "E.
