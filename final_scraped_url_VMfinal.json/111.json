What about those who can’t afford it? Or people renting their homes?", "Only about half of buildings have roofs that are large enough, face the right direction, and get enough sun for solar energy production.", "Community solar picks up where traditional rooftop solar isn’t available.", "Through community solar, individuals subscribe to a portion of a nearby solar project and get credits on their energy bill for the electricity it produces.", "This way, people without the financial means for solar on their rooftops and people who don’t own suitable rooftops can still reap the benefits of renewable energy.", "Local governments and installers can go even further to include subscribers with poor credit, or use local installers on the project.", "Community solar can and has been installed on places of worship, in brownfields, and over parking lots.", "For more details on the benefits of community solar, see this report from Vote Solar, MnSEIA, and the Institute for Local Self-Reliance.", "We report on Minnesota’s community solar program every month in this blog post, but community solar is gaining traction in other states, too.", "Community solar can happen in any state sharing two key market characteristics: virtual net metering and requirements for utilities to connect distributed solar to the grid (interconnection rules).", "Community solar program legislation can include both elements.", "16 states have passed legislation enabling community shared solar gardens, but only four have active programs with multiple installations.", "This post will be updated quarterly with the number of projects and megawatts of installed capacity in each state with a formal community solar program that allows non-utility ownership.", "Although rural electric cooperatives have built a significant amount of community solar, the programs do not allow non-utility ownership and may differ from state-based programs that are structured to provide bill savings to customers.", "After a successful pilot program in 2010, Colorado finally saw an expanded community solar garden program in 2016.", "The program still has a cap of 105 MW, a figure grown out of Xcel’s settlement deal. The Colorado community solar program has always had a goal of inclusivity.", "Since the 2010 pilot, the program has had a 5% carveout for low-income customers. Now, advocates hope this percentage can be dramatically increased as the state continues to update the program.", "At the end of 2019, Colorado’s community solar program hit 72 completed projects with 81 total megawatts of operational capacity.", "Xcel Energy reports on Colorado’s community solar program in its annual Renewable Energy Compliance reports.", "Although the Massachusetts Senate passed a virtual net metering bill in 2008, it didn’t begin tracking community solar projects until 2014.", "Community solar programs qualify for two Massachusetts Department of Energy Resources programs: RPS Solar Carve-out II and Solar Massachusetts Renewable Target (SMART).", "In the first quarter of 2020, Massachusetts’s community solar program hit 197 completed projects with 276 total megawatts of operational capacity.", "Data from the month of March has not yet been released.", "Minnesota’s community solar program launched in December of 2014, with the first full megawatt of projects installed in January 2017.", "The program has since taken off to become the most successful in the country. The success of the program in Minnesota can largely be attributed to its design, which places no caps on community solar project development.", "It is also carefully constructed to make solar economically viable. According to ILSR’s analysis, the program has saved Xcel Energy customers millions of dollars.", "In the first quarter of 2020, Minnesota’s community solar program hit 274 completed projects with 680 total megawatts of operational capacity.", "In 2017, New York’s Public Service Commission passed the Value of Distributed Energy Resources (VDER) tariff.", "Meant to replace net metering, VDER credits distributed solar with a monetary value based on the many values that it provides to the system, including avoided fuel costs and avoided future power plant construction costs (for a deep dive, see our 2018 VDER coverage).", "Big utilities have supported VDER because, in some cases, the compensation rate of VDER is much lower than net metering.", "On top of this, it has made community solar programs confusing for developers and customers. In 2018, community solar advocates tried to put a moratorium on VDER, likening it to the Darth Vader of the community solar world.", "The Public Service Commission hopes a 2019 update will improve the program and make way for more community solar.", "In the first quarter of 2020, New York’s community solar program jumped to 190 completed projects with 261 total megawatts of operational capacity.", "Each program has been constantly evolving. Several of the programs have had to loosen restrictions, increase individual project size limits, and expand the overall size of the program.", "New programs would do well to build these changes into their programs from the beginning.", "To date, Minnesota has seen the most success with community solar. Massachusetts and Minnesota had close to the same installed capacity in quarter three of 2017, 114 MW and 116 MW respectively, but the Massachusetts program has not been able to achieve the same rate of growth as Minnesota.", "This is, again, because the Minnesota program has no caps and secures an economical payout for installations.", "Colorado and Minnesota are served by the same utility company. Xcel in Colorado (the Public Service Company of Colorado), however, has maintained severe program caps on Solar Rewards Community Gardens.", "The Colorado Public Utilities Commission has approved each program cap in a series of expansions. Despite the Colorado state legislation passing one of the first community solar bills in 2010, the program has struggled to grow within its confines.", "Hawaii, Illinois, and Maryland all have budding community solar programs, but have yet to see many interconnected projects.", "- Hawaii, by an April 2020 Public Utilities Commission order, has begun phase two of its community solar program.", "In this phase, more program capacity has been allotted and the program will now include additional technologies and community solar gardens specifically for low-to-moderate income subscribers.", "- Illinois has allotted much of the Illinois Solar for All program capacity, and many projects had their applications approved, but few have completed construction.", "- Maryland’s community solar pilot program commenced in 2017. Utilities are reviewing applications, but as in Illinois, few have been approved and constructed.", "Return to this page for updates on programs in these states as they get started, in addition to quarterly progress of the top four.", "- ILSR’s Community Power Map, showing local and state policies and programs that help advance clean energy goals across the country", "- The Community Power Toolkit, which includes community solar as one of 20+ tools communities can use to build energy democracy", "- Why Minnesota’s Community Solar Program is the Best, which tracks Minnesota’s Community Solar Program monthly since 2015", "- 2020 Report Designing Community Solar Programs that Promote Racial and Economic Equity", "- 2019 Report Minnesota’s Solar Gardens: the Status and Benefits of Community Solar", "- 2016 report Beyond Sharing — How Communities Can Take Ownership of Renewable Power", "For podcasts, videos, and more, see ILSR’s community renewable energy archive.", "This article originally posted at ilsr.org.

INTRODUCTION Modern wind power plants (WPPs), comprised of a large number of wind turbine generators (WTGs), a collector system, collector and/or interconnect substation utilize machines that are designed to optimize the generation of power using the energy in the wind.", "WTGs have developed from small machines with output power ratings on the order of kilowatts to several megawatts, and from machines with limited speed control and other capabilities to machines with variable speed control capabilities over a wide speed range and sophisticated control capabilities using modern power electronics [1].", "The application of WTGs in modern WPPs requires an understanding of a number of different aspects related to the design and capabilities of the machines involved.", "This paper, authored by members of the Wind Plant Collector Design Working Group of the IEEE, is intended to provide insight into the various wind turbine generator designs, based on classification by machine type and speed (‘‘Characteristics of Wind Turbine Generators for Wind Power Plants’’ IEEE PES Wind Plant Collector System Design Working Group.", "control capabilities, along with their operational characteristics, voltage, reactive power, or power factor control capabilities, voltage ride-through characteristics, behavior during short circuits, and reactive power capabilities.", "II. TURBINE CHARACTERISTICS The principle of wind turbine operation is based on two well-known processes.", "The first one involves the conversion of kinetic energy of moving air into mechanical energy. This is accomplished by using aerodynamic rotor blades and a variety of methodologies for mechanical power control.", "The second process is the electromechanical energy conversion through a generator that is transmitted to the electrical grid.", "Wind turbines can be classified by their mechanical power control, and further divided by their speed control.", "All turbine blades convert the motion of air across the air foils to torque, and then regulate that torque in an attempt to capture as much energy as possible, yet prevent damage.", "At the top level turbines can be classified as either stall regulated (with active stall as an improvement) or pitch regulated.", "Stall regulation is achieved by shaping the turbine blades such that the airfoil generates less aerodynamic force at high wind speed, eventually stalling, thus reducing the turbine’s torque-this is a simple, inexpensive and robust mechanical system.", "Pitch regulation, on the other hand, is achieved through the use of pitching devices in the turbine hub, which twist the blades around their own axes.", "As the wind speed changes, the blade quickly pitches to the optimum angle to control torque in order to capture the maximum energy or self-protect, as needed.", "Some turbines now are able to pitch each blade independently to achieve more balanced torques on the rotor shaft given wind speed differences at the top and bottom of the blade arcs.", "Beyond mechanical power regulation, turbines are further divided into fixed speed (Type 1), limited variable speed (Type 2), or variable speed with either partial (Type 3) or full (Type 4) power electronic conversion.", "The different speed control types are implemented via different rotating ac machines and the use of power electronics.", "There is one other machine type that will be referred to as Type 5 in which a mechanical torque converter between the rotor’s low-speed shaft and the generator’s high-speed shaft controls the generator speed to the electrical synchronous speed.", "This type of machine then uses a synchronous machine directly connected to the medium voltage grid. The Type 1 WTG is implemented with a squirrel-cage induction generator (SCIG) and is connected to the stepup transformer directly.", "See Figure 1. The turbine speed is fixed (or nearly fixed) to the electrical grid’s frequency, and generates real power (P) when the turbine shaft rotates faster than the electrical grid frequency creating a negative slip (positive slip and power is motoring convention).", "Figure 2 shows the power flow at the SCIG terminals. While there is a bit of variability in output with the slip of the machine, Type 1 turbines typically operate at or very close to a rated speed.", "machine is the reactive power that it consumes for its excitation field and the large currents the machine can draw when started ‘‘across-the-line.’’", "To ameliorate these effects the turbine typically employs a soft starter and discrete steps of capacitor banks within the turbine.", "In Type 2 turbines, wound rotor induction generators arc connected directly to the WTG step-up transformer in a fashion similar to Type 1 with regards to the machines stator circuit, but also include a variable resistor in the rotor circuit.", "See Figure 3. This can be accomplished with a set of resistors and power electronics external to the rotor with currents flowing between the resistors and rotor via slip rings.", "Alternately, the resistors and electronics can be mounted on the rotor, eliminating the slip rings—this is the Weier design.", "The variable resistors are connected into the rotor circuit softly and can control the rotor currents quite rapidly so as to keep constant power even during gusting conditions, and can influence the machine’s dynamic response during grid disturbances.", "By adding resistance to the rotor circuit, the real power curve, which was shown in Figure 2, can be ‘‘stretched’’ to the higher slip and higher speed ranges.", "See Figure 4.

This allows some ability to control the speed, with the blades’ pitching mechanisms and move the turbines operation to a tip speed ratio (ration of tip speed to the ambient wind speed) to achieve the best energy capture.", "It is typical that speed variations of up to 10% are possible, allowing for some degree of freedom in energy capture and self protective torque control.", "The Type 3 turbine, known commonly as the Doubly Fed Induction Generator (DFIG) or Doubly Fed Asynchronous Generator (DFAG), takes the Type 2 design to the next level, by adding variable frequency ac excitation (instead of simply resistance) to the rotor circuit.", "The additional rotor excitation is supplied via slip rings by a current regulated, voltage-source converter, which can adjust the rotor currents’ magnitude and phase nearly instantaneously.", "This rotor-side converter is connected back-to-back with a grid side converter, which exchanges power directly with the grid.", "See Figure 5. A small amount power injected into the rotor circuit can effect a large control of power in the stator circuit.", "This is a major advantage of the DFIG—a great deal of control of the output is available with the presence of a set of converters that typically are only 30% of the rating of the machine.", "In addition to the real power that is delivered to the grid from the generator’s stator circuit, power is delivered to the grid through the grid-connected inverter when the generator is moving faster than synchronous speed.", "When the generator is moving slower than synchronous speed, real power flows from the grid, through both converters, and from rotor to stator.", "These two modes, made possible by the four-quadrant nature of the two converters, allows a much wider speed range, both above and below synchronous speed by up to 50%, although narrower ranges are more common.", "The greatest advantage of the DFIG, is that it offers the benefits of separate real and reactive power control, much like a traditional synchronous generator, while", "being able to run asynchronously. The field of industrial drives has produced and matured the concepts of vector or field oriented control of induction machines.", "Using these control schemes, the torque producing components of the rotor flux can be made to respond fast enough that the machine remains under relative control, even during significant grid disturbances.", "Indeed, while more expensive than the Type 1 or 2 machines, the Type 3 is becoming popular due to its advantages.", "The Type 4 turbine (Figure 6) offers a great deal of flexibility in design and operation as the output of the rotating machine is sent to the grid through a full-scale back-to-back frequency converter.", "The turbine is allowed to rotate at its optimal aerodynamic speed, resulting in a ‘‘wild’’ ac output from the machine.", "In addition, the gearbox may be eliminated, such that the machine spins at the slow turbine speed and generates an electrical frequency well below that of the grid.", "This is no problem for a Type 4 turbine, as the inverters convert the power, and offer the possibility of reactive power supply to the grid, much like a STATCOM.", "The rotating machines of this type have been constructed as wound rotor synchronous machines, similar to conventional generators found in hydroelectric plants with control of the field current and high pole numbers, as permanent magnet synchronous machines, or as squirrel cage induction machines.", "However, based upon the ability of the machine side inverter to control real and reactive power flow, any type of machine could be used.", "Advances in power electronic devices and controls in the last decade have made the converters both responsive and efficient.", "It does bear mentioning, however, that the power electronic converters have to be sized to pass the full rating of the rotating machine, plus any capacity to be used for reactive compensation.", "Type 5 turbines (Figure 7) consist of a typical WTG variable-speed drive train connected to a torque/ speed converter coupled with a synchronous generator.", "The torque/speed converter changes the variable speed of the rotor shaft to a constant output shaft speed.", "CHAPTER 6 POWER FLOWS bus or on the high side of the main power transformer.

VOLTAGE, REACTIVE POWER, AND POWER FACTOR CONTROL CAPABILITIES The voltage control capabilities of a WTG depend on the wind turbine type.", "Type 1 and Type 2 WTGs can typically not control voltage. Instead, these WTGs typically use power factor correction capacitors (PFCCs) to maintain the power factor or reactive power output on the lowvoltage terminals of the machine to a setpoint.", "Types 3 through 5 WTGs can control voltage. These WTGs are capable of varying the reactive power at a given active power and terminal voltage, which enables voltage control [2].", "In a Type 3 WTG voltage is controlled by changing the direct component of the rotor current (this is the component of the current that is in-line with the stator flux).", "In a Type 4 WTG voltage control is achieved by varying the quadrature (reactive) component of current at the gridside converter.", "To allow voltage control capability, the gridside converter must be rated above the rated MW of the machine.", "Since a synchronous generator is used in a Type 5 WTG, an automatic voltage regulator (AVR) is typically needed.", "Modern AVRs can be programmed to control reactive power, power factor and voltage. The voltage control capabilities of individual WTGs are typically used to control the voltage at the collector", "IV. REACTIVE POWER CAPABILITIES The reactive power capabilities of modern WTGs are significant as most grid codes require the WPP to have reactive power capability at the point of interconnect over a specified power factor range, for example 0.95 leading (inductive) to 0.95 lagging (capacitive).", "Typical interconnect requirements related to total WPP reactive power capabilities are discussed in [3].", "As stated earlier, Type 1 and Type 2 WTGs typically use PFCCs to maintain the power factor or reactive power of the machine to a specified setpoint.", "The PFCCs may be sized to maintain a slightly leading (inductive) power factor of around 0.98 at rated power output.", "This is often referred to as no-load compensation. With full-load compensation, the PFCCs are sized to maintain unity power factor or, in some cases, a slightly lagging (capacitive) power factor at the machine’s rated power output.", "The PFCCs typically consists of multiple stages of capacitors switched with a low-voltage ac contactor.", "Type 3 (DFIG) WTGs typically have a reactive power capability corresponding to a power factor of 0.95 lagging (capacitive) to 0.90 leading (inductive) at the terminals of the machines.", "Options for these machines include an expanded reactive power capability of 0.90 lagging to 0.90 leading.", "Some Type 3 WTGs can deliver reactive power even when the turbine is not operating mechanically, while no real power is generated.", "As previously stated, Type 4 WTGs can vary the gridside converter current, allowing control of the effective power factor of the machines over a wide range.", "Reactive power limit curves for different terminal voltage levels are typically provided. Some Type 4 WTGs can deliver reactive power even when the turbine is not operating mechanically, while no real power is generated.", "The synchronous generator in a Type 5 WTG has inherent dynamic reactive power capabilities similar to that of Type 3 and 4 machines.", "See Figure 8. Depending on the design of the generator, operating power factor ranges at rated output can vary from 0.8 leading to 0.8 lagging.", "Figure 8 Reactive Power Capabilities of a 2 MW Type 5 WTG A range of 0.9 leading and lagging is more typical.", "At power outputs below rated power, the reactive power output is only limited by rotor or stator heating, stability concerns, and local voltage conditions and it is unlikely that PFCCs would be required.", "As with some Type 3 and 4 WTGs, it is also possible to operate the machine as a synchronous condenser, requiring minimal active power output with adjustable reactive power output levels.", "V. VOLTAGE RIDE-THROUOH The voltage ride-through (VRT) capabilities of WTGs vary widely and have evolved based on requirements in various grid codes.", "In the United States, low voltage ride-through (LVRT) requirements specified in FERC Order 661-A [5] calls for wind power plants to ride-through a three-phase fault on the high side of the substation transformer for up to 9 cycles, depending on the primary fault clearing time of the fault interrupting circuit breakers at the location.", "There is no high voltage ride-through (HVRT) requirement in FERC order 661-A, but NERC and some ISO/ RTOs are in the process of imposing such requirement.", "In many European countries WPP are required not to trip for a high voltage level up to 110% of the nominal voltage at the POI [4].", "Some of the Type 1 WTGs have limited VRT capability and may require a central reactive power compensation system [4] to meet wind power plant VRT capability.", "Many of the Types 2, 3, and 4 WTGs have VRT capabilities that may meet the requirements of FERC Order 661, which was issued before FERC Order 661-A (i.e., withstand a three-phase fault for 9 cycles at a voltage as low as 0.15 p.u measured on the high side of the substation", "transformer). Most WTGs are expected to ultimately meet the FERC 661-A requirements. The VRT of a Type 5 WTG is very similar to that of standard grid-connected synchronous generators, which are well understood.", "The capabilities of the excitation system (AVR) and physical design of the generator (machine constants, time constants) will determine the basic performance of a synchronous generator during transient conditions.", "In order to meet utility VRT requirements, the settings and operation of the turbine control system, excitation system and protection systems must be generally coordinated and then fine-tuned for a specific site.", "VI. WTG BEHAVIOR DURING GRID SHORT CIRCUITS The response of WTGs to short circuits on the grid depends largely on the type of WTG.", "While the response of Type 1 and Type 2 WTGs are essentially similar to that of large induction machines used in industrial applications, the response of Type 3, 4, and 5 WTGs is dictated by the WTG controls.", "In short circuit calculations, a Type 1 WTG can be represented as a voltage source in series 00 with the direct axis sub-transient inductance Xd .", "This practice is used to consider the maximum short-circuit contribution from the induction generator as it determines the symmetrical current magnitude during the first few cycles after the fault.", "A Type 1 WTG can contribute short circuit current up to the value of its locked rotor current which is usually on the order of 5 to 6 p.u", "[6]. Type 2 WTGs employing limited speed control via controlled external rotor resistance are fundamentally induction generators.", "If, during the fault, the external resistance control were to result in short-circuiting of the generator rotor, the short-circuit behavior would be similar to Type 1.", "On the other hand, if the control action at or shortly after fault inception were to result in insertion of the full external resistance, the equivalent voltage source-behind-Thevenin impedance representation for the WTG should be modified to include this significant resistance value in series with the equivalent turbine inductance.", "Other wind turbine topologies employ some type of power electronic control. Consequently, the behavior during short-circuit conditions cannot be ascertained directly from the physical structure of the electrical generator.", "switches can have significant influence on the short-circuit currents contributed by the turbine, and the details of these controllers are generally held closely by the turbine manufacturers.", "For Type 3 WTGs (DFIG), if during the fault, the rotor power controller remains active, the machine stator currents would be limited between 1.1 to 2.5 p.u. of the machine rated current.", "Under conditions where protective functions act to ‘‘crowbar’’ the rotor circuit, the short-circuit behavior defaults to 5 to 6 p.u.", "in the case of a fault applied directly to the WTG terminals. [7] In turbines employing full-rated power converters as the interface to the grid (Type 4), currents during network faults will be limited to slightly above rated current.", "This limitation is affected by the power converter control, and is generally necessary to protect the power semiconductor switches.", "Type 5 WTGs exhibit typical synchronous generator behavior during grid short circuits. Generator contribution to grid faults can be calculated from the machine constants, obtainable from the generator manufacturer.", "Fault current contribution for line to ground faults will depend on the type of generator grounding used.", "Typical generator fault current contribution can range from 4 to more times rated current for close-in bolted three-phase faults.", "Fault current contribution for single-line to ground faults can range from near zero amps (ungrounded neutral) to more than the three-phase bolted level (depending on the zero sequence impedance of solidly grounded generators.)", "A joint Working Group sponsored by the Power Systems Relaying Committee (PSRC) and the T&D Committee on short-circuit contributions from WTGs is currently discussing this topic.", "It is expected that more specific guidelines on considerations in determining short-circuit contributions from different types of WTGs will be forthcoming.", "VII.

COEXISTENCE OF THE TWO GENERATIONS OF ELECTRICITY GRIDS As discussed earlier, utilities require that the AMI systems now being implemented ensure an evolutionary path to the smart grid.", "The costs associated with AMI rollout are simply too high to permit an overhaul of the installed systems in preparation for an eventual transition to the smart grid.", "As such, industry pundits believe that for the foreseeable future the old and the new grids will operate side by side, with functionality and load to be migrated gradually from the old system to the new one over time.", "And in the not too distant future, the smart grid will emerge as a system of organically integrated smart microgrids with pervasive visibility and command-and-control functions distributed across all levels.", "The topology of the emerging grid will therefore resemble a hybrid solution, the core intelligence of which grows as a function of its maturity and extent.", "Figure 10 shows the topology of the smart grid in transition.", "Despite assurances from AMI technology providers, the utilities expect the transition from AMI to the smart grid to be far from a smooth ride.", "Many believe that major problems could surface when disparate systems, functions, and components begin to be integrated as part of a distributed command-and-control system.", "Most of these issues have their roots in the absence of the universally accepted interfaces, messaging and control protocols, and standards that would be required to ensure a common communication vocabulary among system components.", "There are others who do not share this notion, however, arguing that given all the efforts under way in standardization bodies, the applicable standards will emerge to help with plug-and-play integration of various smart grid system components.", "Examples of such standards are ANSI C12.22 for smart metering and IEC 61850 for substation automation.", "Moreover, to help with the development of the required standards, the power industry is gradually adopting different terminologies for the partitioning of the command-and-control layers of the smart grid.", "Examples include home area network or HAN (used to identify the network of communicating loads, sensors, and appliances beyond the smart meter and within the customer’s premises); local area network or LAN (used to identify the network of integrated smart meters, field components, and gateways that form the logical network between distribution substations and a customer’s premises); and, last but not least, wide area network or WAN (used to identify the network of upstream utility assets, including—but not limited to— power plants, distributed storage, substations, and so on).", "As Figure 11 shows, the interface between the WAN and LAN worlds consists of substation gateways, while the interface between LAN and HAN is provided by smart meters.", "The security and vulnerability of these interfaces will be the focus of much technological and standardization development in the near future.", "EMERGING SMART GRID STANDARDS Recent developments in the power industry point to the need to move towards an industry-wide consensus on a suite of standards enabling end-toend command and data exchange between various components of the smart grid.", "Focused efforts and leadership by NIST (United States National Institute of Standards and Technology) is yielding good results.", "Grid Interoperability Standards (Release 1.0, September 2009) identifies priority areas for standardization and a list of standards that need to be further refined, developed, and/or implemented.", "Similar efforts in Europe and elsewhere point to the necessity of the development of a common information model (CIM) to enable vertical and lateral integration of applications and functions within the smart grid.", "Among the list of proposed standards, IEC 61850 and its associate standards are emerging as favorites for WAN data communication, supporting TCP/IP, among other protocols, over fiber or a 1.8-GHz flavor of WiMax.", "In North America, ANSI C12.22, and its associated standards, is viewed as the favorite LAN standard, enabling a new generation of smart meters capable of communicating with their peers as well as with their corresponding substation gateways over a", "variety of wireless technologies.

The fact of the matter is that despite all the capabilities the smart grid promises to yield, the utilities, as providers of a critical service, still see as their primary concern keeping the lights on.", "Given the fact that utilities cannot and may not venture into adopting new technologies without exhaustive validation and qualification, one can readily see that one of the major difficulties utilities across the world are facing is the absence of near-real world RD&D capability to enable them develop, validate, and qualify technologies, applications, and solutions for their smart grid programs.", "The problem most utility providers face is not the absence of technology. On the contrary, many disparate technologies have been developed by the industry (e.g., communication protocols, computing engines, sensors, algorithms, and models) to address utility applications and resolve potential issues within the smart grid.", "The problem is that these new technologies have not yet been proven in the context of the utility providers’ desired specifications, configurations, and architecture.", "Given the huge responsibility utilities have in connection with operating and maintaining their critical infrastructure, they cannot be expected to venture boldly and without proper preparation into new territories, new technologies, and new solutions.", "As such, utilities are in critical need of a near-real-world environment, with real loads, distribution gear, and diverse consumption profiles, to develop, test, and validate their required smart grid solutions.", "Such an environment would in essence constitute a smart microgrid. Similar to a typical smart microgrid, an RD&D micro-grid will incorporate not only the three major components of generation, loads, and smart controls but also a flexible and highly programmable command-and-control overlay enabling engineers to develop, experiment with, and validate the utility’s target requirements.", "Figure 12 depicts a programmable command-and-control overlay for an RD&D microgrid set up on the Burnaby campus of the British Columbia Institute of Technology (BCIT) in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada.", "technology providers, and researchers to work together to facilitate the commercialization of architectures, protocols, configurations, and models of the evolving smart grid.", "The ultimate goal is to chart a ‘‘path from lab to field’’ for innovative and cost-effective technologies and solutions for the evolving smart electricity grid.", "In addition to a development environment, BCIT’s smart microgrid is also a test bed where multitudes of smart grid components, technologies, and applications are integrated to qualify the Figure 12 merits of different solutions, showcase Command-and-control overlay of the BCIT RD&D microgrid their capabilities, and accelerate the commercialization of technologies and solutions Sponsored by BC Hydro and funded jointly by for the smart grid.", "As an example, Figure 13 the British Columbia government’s Innovative shows how such an infrastructure may be proClean Energy (ICE) Fund and the Canadian grammed to enable utilities to develop, test, and government’s Western Diversification Fund, validate their front-end and field capabilities in BCIT’s smart microgrid enables utility providers,", "Figure 13 Process overlay of the BCIT RD&D microgrid", "with a state-of-the-art RD&D microgrid that can be used to accelerate the evolution of the smart grid in North America.", "Figure 14 The BCIT smart grid control center (used with permission)", "line with their already existing back-office business processes and tools.

The growth is primarily due to a 1.5 GWdc announcement from Florida Power & Light and 1.1 GWdc announced by Duke Energy in the Carolinas.", "Florida Power & Light’s development of its own solar projects makes up the bulk of Florida’s five-year forecast, with additional announcements from Duke Florida, Teco Energy and Jacksonville Electric expected to add to the pipeline in that state.", "Voluntary procurement of utility PV based on its economic competitiveness continues to be the primary driver of projects announced in 2019.", "While many states, utilities and cities have announced or proposed 50% or 100% renewable energy or zero-carbon standards, the announcements have not yet resulted in an uptick in RPS-driven procurement.", "Corporate procurement of utility solar drove 22% of projects announced in 2018 and continues apace in 2019, with 14% of projects announced having a corporate offtaker.", "(Wood Mackenzie classifies large offsite projects with C&I offtakers as utility-scale rather than distributed due to the size and structure of the deals.)", "As the number of corporations pledging to use 100% renewable power continues to grow, corporate procurement is expected to remain a strong driver of utility PV.", "Despite steady installations in Q1 2019, the residential market is still highly reliant on legacy state markets, such as California and the Northeast, which have seen only modest to flat growth over the past several quarters.", "As these major state markets continue to grow past early-adopter consumers, higher costs of customer acquisition will challenge the industry to innovate product offerings and diversify geographically.", "Indeed, 29% of residential capacity in Q1 2019 came from markets outside the top 10 (by cumulative capacity), the highest share for emerging markets in industry history.", "From 2019-2021, residential growth will range from 5%-20% due to both emerging markets with strong resource fundamentals like Florida and Texas, and markets where recent policy developments have increased our near-term forecasts.", "Maryland’s recent renewable portfolio standard increase, the removal of South Carolina’s net metering cap, and new incentive programs such as Illinois’ Adjustable Block Program will provide significant upside and growth to our residential forecasts over the next few years.", "Meanwhile, California’s new home solar mandate will also help to offset market penetration challenges beginning in 2020.", "In the long term, the ITC step-down is expected to pull in demand in both legacy and emerging markets before declining in 2022.", "Growth resumes in 2023 and continues into 2024 based on economic fundamentals as the market adjusts to post-ITC market conditions.", "That said, long-term growth in a post-ITC world will be contingent on geographic diversification outside of legacy state markets and technological/business-model innovation to improve product offerings in solar-plus-storage.", "Non-residential installation totals in Q1 2019 were the weakest since Q1 2017 as all three major state markets (California, Massachusetts and Minnesota) saw declining volumes due to state-level policy reforms and interconnection delays that continue to limit development opportunities.", "Overall, the non-residential PV market is on track for another down year as the segment acclimates to a reduced incentive environment across major state markets.", "However, this will be incrementally offset starting in 2020 as the next wave of states with robust community solar mandates – New York, Maryland, Illinois and New Jersey – experience growth.", "Furthermore, recent policy developments in New York and Maryland will ultimately provide for growth in our long-term outlook.", "Significant revisions to the Value of Distributed Energy Resources (VDER) docket in New York have bolstered our long-term forecasts for both commercial and community solar, while an RPS increase in Maryland will boost the sagging SREC market to the benefit of the entire non-residential segment.", "Increasing solar-plus-storage viability will also begin to have an impact on non-residential demand as policymakers and business leaders increasingly consider energy storage in their decisions.", "New York’s recent development of the Bridge Incentive increases our long-term solar-plus-storage forecasts with further potential upside.", "By 2023, roughly 30% of total non-residential PV will come from community solar, and ~20% will come from solar-plus-storage projects.", "The U.S. utility solar forecast for 2019-2024 has grown by 5.1 GWdc since last quarter. The largest contributor is an increase to Florida’s five-year outlook from 6.0 GWdc to 9.0 GWdc due to new solar procurement by Florida Power & Light (FPL), Duke Energy Florida, and other Florida utilities (most of which is utility self-build).", "This positions Florida to be the top state for utility PV over the next six years.", "Since last quarter, the 2019 forecast has grown by 1.2 GW, due largely to late project announcements in Texas that raised the state’s forecast by 720 MWdc.", "While the forecast for 2020 saw little change to overall expected capacity additions, over 10.0 GWdc of utility PV are still expected to come online that year.", "From 2021-2023, our utility PV forecast has increased by 2.8 GWdc. While the bulk of this increase is found in Florida, there are a growing number of utilities such as Xcel Energy, Idaho Power and PacifiCorp, among others, announcing additional solar procurement, expedited coal plant retirement, or plans to achieve 50% to 100% renewable or carbon-free energy targets, all of which have boosted the midterm forecast.", "During this time, utility PV also becomes increasingly competitive with wind. As the wind-focused federal Production Tax Credit steps down, solar begins to fall below the cost of wind on a levelized cost of energy (LCOE) basis in many traditional wind states such as Illinois, Iowa, Kansas, Michigan and the Dakotas by the mid-2020s.", "(Wood Mackenzie’s LCOE calculations for solar take the ITC incentive into account.) This is likely not only to drive more solar procurement in wind-dominant regions of Midcontinent Independent System Operator and Southwest Power Pool, but also to make solar the preferred renewable technology for corporate offtakers.", "Oklahoma Gas & Electric’s recent RFP for solar-plus-storage is the first example of what is likely to be a trend in solar procurement in the Prairies and Midwest.", "Our 2024 forecast has also increased by 1.1 GWdc. Many utilities such as Dominion, Tennessee Valley Authority and FPL have outlined solar procurement plans for 2024 and beyond.", "Despite the ITC having fully stepped down to 10% by that time, utility PV will remain economically competitive with new-build wind and natural gas in many places.", "We employ a bottom-up modeling methodology to track and report national average PV system pricing for the major market segments.", "This methodology is based on tracked wholesale pricing of major solar components and data collected from interviews with major installers.", "In Q1 2019, system pricing fell in all market segments.

Renewable energy, or RE, investment in U.S. wind, solar, hydro, and geothermal power has increased nearly 250 percent since 2004, reaching 36.7 billion in 2013.", "These numbers only represent part of clean energy’s full investment potential as new regulations on carbon emissions and advances in technology will significantly increase demand for low-carbon fuels.", "Public and private analyses of future energy use both foresee a surge in natural gas and RE. Relative to 2011 levels, the U.S. Energy Information Administration, or EIA, projects that natural gas consumption will grow 12.2 percent by 2030, even as low prices, debate about exports, and future carbon constraints create an uncertain trajectory for future natural gas development.", "EIA also predicts that 50.2 percent of new electricity consumption will come from natural gas and 46.6 percent from renewables by 2030.", "However, this prediction may be overly conservative. A Deutsche Bank analysis predicts that total coal-based electricity generation will fall from 45 percent in 2010 to 20 percent by 2030 and that natural gas will largely replace coal as the majority share of total electricity generation.", "Deutsche Bank also forecasts a 0.7 percent compound annual growth rate for electricity demand. This is consistent with the past 20-year rate of energy use, despite increased population and urbanization, due to anticipated improvements in efficiency over the next 20 years.", "As new and existing power plants turn from fossil fuels, energy efficiency will become a greater part of the U.S. energy portfolio.", "At the same time, wind and solar energy—which generated only 3 percent of U.S. electricity in 2010—are projected to experience significant growth and provide 17 percent of electricity by 2030.", "Base load hydropower and geothermal energy are predicted to maintain their current levels of 7 percent of power generation.", "Altogether, Deutsche Bank predicts that renewable electricity will account for one-quarter of all U.S. electricity generation by 2030.", "These findings may show only a slice of clean energy’s investment potential for three reasons. First, both states and the federal governments are moving to limit carbon pollution.", "Second, technological advances in clean energy offer a cost-effective, certain investment opportunity.", "Finally, financial tools and foreign investment can inject additional capital into the clean energy market.", "Clean energy is at an apex of viability and affordability as financial institutions and governments seek to secure a lower-carbon future.", "Government actions to reduce greenhouse gas emissions", "Federal efforts to cut harmful carbon pollution have created an environment ripe for clean energy investment.", "President Barack Obama’s Climate Action Plan outlines a federal plan to lower carbon pollution and prepare the United States for the effects of a warmer climate, including more extreme and frequent storms, sea-level rise, drought, and changes in precipitation.", "The Climate Action Plan relies heavily on the Environmental Protection Agency, or EPA, as the main regulatory agency coordinating the administration’s effort to lower carbon pollution.", "The EPA is legally obligated to regulate pollutants that are harmful to public health under the Clean Air Act.", "Former EPA Administrator Lisa Jackson issued an endangerment finding in 2009 that indicates that greenhouse gases, or GHG—including carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide, and hydro fluorocarbons—are harmful to public health and welfare for current and future generations.", "The EPA findings align with those of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, which concluded that human-produced greenhouse gas emissions are already affecting fresh water availability, migration patterns, crop yields, human health, and extreme weather around the globe.", "The endangerment finding legally obligates the EPA to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. As part of that obligation, the EPA is currently in the process of setting pollution standards for both the transportation sector and power plants.", "Both of these types of standards provide opportunities for technological innovation. In particular, the companies that make pollution-reducing and energy-efficient technology will be able to increase supply and energy-efficiency capacity to meet the increased demand for efficiency created by these pollution-limiting regulations.", "EPA carbon-pollution standards will require states to meet the federal emissions standards through either submitting their own implementation plans to the EPA or complying with a federal plan imposed on the state.", "Therefore, states have an incentive to create a plan that fits their unique energy portfolio. Investments in renewable energy, energy efficiency, and demand response—the incentives for consumers to reduce energy use during times of high demand—will be the most effective methods to reduce emissions while creating economic opportunity.", "The federal government is also examining how clean energy investment may counteract the effects of extreme weather.", "The U.S. Department of Energy released a report in 2013 that outlined how extreme weather, droughts, heat waves, and wildfires", "will affect American energy infrastructure. Hurricane Sandy in 2012 demonstrated consumers’ vulnerability when almost 8 million people lost their power across the affected region.", "Energy producers are also at risk, as storms and sea-level rise could potentially disrupt oil and gas production, as well as electricity generation and distribution.", "Decreased water availability and higher temperatures could lead to full or partial shutdowns at thermoelectric power plants—those powered by coal, natural gas, and nuclear energy—that need water for cooling.", "Drought and declining snow- pack could cause hydropower shortages. Higher temperatures will also likely lead to the increased use of air conditioning with a higher risk of blackouts and brownouts in some regions during peak electricity consumption.", "Resilient grid infrastructure, including micro-grid development, can help alleviate these concerns by producing more reliable energy while mitigating climate change.", "However, energy infrastructure will need to incorporate new technologies to ensure the resilience and reliability of electricity provision.", "The U.S. Department of Energy sees opportunities for improved energy efficiency, technologies to reduce water use, and “hardening” existing facilities to endure wildfires, storms, floods, and sea-level rise.", "As the federal government limits carbon pollution in power plants and develops higher fuel-economy standards, investors can help the manufacturing, auto, and energy industries meet those requirements.", "State and local leaders have been using a suite of policy tools to limit greenhouse gas emissions, fight climate change, increase demand for clean energy, and drive economic growth.", "Governors and state legislators, together with key stakeholders, have begun enacting policies to create markets for clean energy.", "Twenty-nine states and the District of Columbia have implemented renewable portfolio standards, or RPS, laws requiring utilities to generate a certain amount of electricity from renewable energy sources.", "State RPS reduce the country’s dependence on polluting fossil fuels to generate electricity by creating reliable markets for renewable energy development and investment.", "Over the past two years, public- and private-sector investment in the U.S. clean energy market has reached $77 billion.", "The majority of renewable portfolio standards were created after 2003, yet many have been revised and strengthened in recent years.", "For example, California originally established its RPS in 2003, and Maryland followed suit in 2004. Since the establishment", "of both laws, state leaders have increased their state’s respective standard and updated the law to allow certain renewable energy technologies to count toward the mandate.", "Maryland’s RPS target is now 20 percent renewable energy sources by 2022 with a mandate for solar energy to contribute 2 percent, while California’s RPS target is 33 percent by 2020.", "In addition to California’s renewable energy mandate, the state also requires that the three major power companies—Pacific Gas & Electric, Southern California Edison, and San Diego Gas & Electric—have electricity storage capacity that can output 1,325 megawatts by 2020.", "This battery storage mandate, the first in the United States, is an important strategy that will not only help manage and balance the inherent variability of renewable electricity generation but will also significantly accelerate investment in storage technologies.", "Today, renewable energy technologies, such as wind, solar, and geothermal, are sup- plying affordable, reliable, and clean power to the equivalent of 16 million American homes—a result of state RPS policies that create a market for investment.", "State RPS policies are tools to affordably create significant levels of renewable energy development, and as a result, the deployment of renewable energy attracts investments from manufacturers, creates jobs, and produces revenue for state and local economies.", "Net metering is a policy that allows customers who supply their own electricity from rooftop solar systems or other technologies to receive a credit on their utility bill for any excess electricity they produce beyond what they use onsite.", "Net metering policies have been implemented in 43 states and the District of Columbia.", "Net metering standards vary from state to state. Utilities in Vermont, for example, must allow net metered systems on a first-come, first-served basis to all customers until the cumulative generating capacity of all the net metering systems on its lines equals 15 percent of the company’s peak demand.", "In Minnesota, there is no limit on statewide capacity, but customers can net meter if their system is less than 40 kilowatts, or kW, in capacity.", "Also, depending on the state, customers can choose to pay the utility for net consumption monthly or settle the account every 12 months.", "RPS and net metering policies can drive greater investment in renewable energy projects when combined with the federal production tax credit or the investment tax credit, both of which help make renewable energy technologies more affordable and viable.", "Solar panel costs dropped 80 percent between 2008 and 2012, while the cost of wind energy declined 43 percent.", "Equally significant, American-made products now account for 70 percent of the value of wind turbines installed in the United States, and a new solar project is being installed in the United States every four minutes.", "If this growth continues at the current pace, the American solar industry could be installing a solar system every minute and twenty seconds by 2016.", "States are developing net metering policies, with or without federal assistance, to promote carbon-free energy.", "At the same time, the decreasing costs of wind and solar technology make these policies more attractive to homeowners.", "Economic incentives such as net metering lead to consumer benefits of decreased energy costs, which spur further investment in solar and wind.", "In addition to clean energy targets and incentives, some states have also created carbon markets to spur clean energy demand.", "The Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative, or RGGI, was the first market-based regulatory cap-and-trade program to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from power plants in the United States.", "RGGI was launched in 2008 when 10 states—Connecticut, Delaware, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, Rhode Island, and Vermont—joined together to create a market whereby the proceeds of emissions-allowance auctions are invested in energy efficiency, renewable energy, and other programs that benefit consumers.", "This program provides millions of dollars in investments to companies that have energy-efficient practices or offer power plant technology that increases efficiency or reduces emissions.", "Some have discounted RGGI’s ability to generate income or decrease emissions, but changes to the program have yielded significant results.", "The cost of the permits in RGGI’s auctions flat-lined at less than $2 per ton in 2010. At such a low price, the incentive to cut emissions was low to nonexistent—a sign that RGGI’s carbon cap was so high that it was not reducing carbon emissions beyond pre-existing business practices.", "In March 2014, RGGI completed its 23rd auction of CO2 allowances. It was the first auction since a new, much lower cap on emissions from the region’s power plants was established in January, and the results were encouraging.", "RGGI auctioned more than 23.491 million CO2 allowances at a clearing price of $4 per allowance.", "The March auction generated $93.96 million in proceeds that will now be available to RGGI states for reinvestment.", "Cumulatively, RGGI auctions have yielded more than $1.6 billion for reinvestment.", "Perhaps most significantly, California also launched a cap-and-trade program for greenhouse gas pollution, which began in January 2013.", "in California generated more than $525 million in revenue for the state, and the", "state anticipates that annual auction revenue will rise over time. Gov. Jerry Brown (D) signed two bills into law in September 2012 establishing guidelines on how this annual revenue will be disbursed.", "will benefit from the revenue but instead provide a framework for how the state will invest cap-and-trade revenue into local projects.", "The first law requires that the revenue from allowance auctions be spent for environmental purposes with an emphasis on improving air quality.", "The second law requires that at least 25 percent of the revenue is spent on programs that benefit disadvantaged communities, which tend to suffer disproportionately from air pollution.", "Notably, there are also nascent efforts at both intra- and international linking of these sub-national markets.", "As of January 2014, Quebec formally linked its program with California’s cap-and-trade market, and Oregon, Washington state, British Columbia, and China signed memorandums of understanding with California to guide collaboration in addressing climate change.", "The impressive growth of renewable energy over the past few years is a signal that state policies—specifically renewable portfolio standards, net metering laws, and cap-and- trade programs—have successfully driven private-sector investment.", "However, more expansion of all proven forms of renewable energy must be promoted. More investment is needed in order to continue diversifying America’s energy sector and create a low- carbon future.", "Clean energy technology: Reduced costs, increased efficiency", "Global clean energy investments reached $254 billion in 2013, with U.S. investment at $36.7 billion, or 14 percent of the global total.", "Investment in this sector has been on a downward trend for the past two years, partially reflecting the declining costs of clean energy technologies since less money is now required to buy the same amount of clean energy.", "Despite lower costs for clean energy systems and upgrades, investment in the first quarter of 2014 rose 9 percent over the same period last year.", "And new research suggests that annual renewable energy investment will increase 230 percent to $630 billion per year by 2030.", "Clean energy technology has become more cost effective and mainstream across the country. In the past five years, wind and solar power use combined have more than doubled and currently make up 4.4 percent of the U.S. electricity generation mix.", "More and more residents, businesses, and utilities are adopting clean energy technologies, due in large part to lower equipment costs, reduced energy prices, and energy savings potential.", "For utilities seeking to add energy capacity, energy efficiency offers a cost-effective alternative to fossil-fuel energy sources.", "In two recent studies, the American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy, or ACEEE, and the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, or LBNL, found that energy efficiency is the lowest-cost energy resource.", "The ACEEE study concluded that utility energy-efficiency programs cost two to three times less than supplying electricity from fossil-fuel resources.", "In addition to energy efficiency, renewable energy resources are also competing with and, in some cases, beating out fossil-fuel energy sources on cost.", "In Colorado, Xcel Energy chose utility-scale solar and wind projects last year over other energy sources based on price alone.", "MidAmerican Energy Company placed the world’s largest onshore wind-turbine order with manufacturer Siemens Energy in December 2013, citing the positive effect the additional wind farms would have on Iowa’s economy.", "In January, a Minnesota administrative judge ruled that utility-scale solar generation was the most cost-effective energy resource to meet 150 megawatts of energy capacity needed by Xcel Energy in the state by 2017.", "Advances in renewable energy technology mean declining costs and offer opportunities for large-scale growth.", "Wind power, geothermal power, and hydropower will continue to play an important part in the future of energy, but solar energy’s decreasing cost and accessibility to the general public uniquely suit it for abundant expansion among governments, investors, corporations, and homeowners.", "As previously noted, solar panel costs dropped 80 percent between 2008 and 2012, while the cost of wind energy declined 43 percent.", "As a testament to the growing popularity and affordability of clean energy, solar panels are now being sold in big-box retail stores, including Best Buy, Home Depot, and Lowe’s.", "Last year, IKEA announced that it would begin selling solar panels in its U.K. stores.", "Additionally, several major corporations have installed solar arrays on many of their stores, including Wal-Mart, Costco, and Kohl’s.", "for up to 407 megawatts of wind energy to power its Iowa data center. Apple has also been switching to renewable energy, with 94 percent of the electricity for its corporate campuses and data centers now coming from renewable sources.", "These major retailers recognize that investing in renewable energy can reduce their energy costs and allow them to allocate resources to other business operations.", "New home construction is also incorporating clean energy technologies. Homebuilder Shea Homes partnered with solar firm SolarCity in 2012 and has since built and sold more than 1,000 energy-efficient, solar-powered residences in Arizona, California, Florida, Nevada, and Washington state.", "In Texas, new houses within two communities in the Dallas-Fort Worth area will come with pre-installed solar panels.", "Solar panel arrays have become standard features for many homebuilders, especially as demand for solar-generated power continues to rise.", "Although solar-powered homes and solar panels are not as attainable for low-income households, a recent Center for American Progress study suggests that solar technology", "is reaching middle-class homeowners in Arizona, California, and New Jersey. In fact,", "the majority of solar installations are occurring in zip codes with median incomes ranging from $40,000 to $90,000.", "Solar leasing programs are a major reason why solar technology has spread beyond wealthy homeowners. These programs allow residents to lease solar energy systems owned by third parties, such as Sunrun or SolarCity, rather than purchasing them outright.", "Solar leasing is available in 14 states and accounts for more than 70 percent of all residential solar installations in California, Arizona, and Colorado.", "Solar loans, which provide a financing option to property owners that lead to direct ownership of rooftop solar systems, have recently emerged as another viable option that could increase solar adoption.", "The residential sector is a fast-growing market for solar power, adding 792 megawatts in 2013—a 60 percent increase from the previous year.", "As renewable energy becomes even more cost and energy efficient, the demand from residential, industrial, and commercial sectors will only increase.", "This primes the United States for greater manufacturing, installation, and maintenance employment in the solar and wind industries.", "Financial tools are contributing to the growth of clean energy investment by driving down the costs associated with raising capital.", "Large-scale financing for clean energy projects is currently expensive, with capital costs comparable to credit card lending rates and high upfront transactional costs.", "Financial instruments that are relatively new to the clean energy sector lower the cost of capital by bundling assets or debt.", "These instruments include securitization; investment yield vehicles, called “yield cos;” and real estate investment trusts, or REITs.", "By aggregating income-producing assets, these tools can transform non-liquid financial assets into tradable commodities, reduce exposure to financial risk, and provide sources of financing that come with lower transactional costs than can be obtained through traditional bank loans, debt, or equity financing.", "These instruments appeal to investors because they generally offer attractive returns and the opportunity to diversify investment portfolios.", "Through securitization, businesses pool debt, such as solar leases or power purchase agreements, in order to issue tradable securities to investors.", "In November 2013, solar leasing company SolarCity sold $54 million in bundled cash payments by pooling together more than 5,000 residential and commercial solar contracts in the solar industry’s first securitization.", "SolarCity can now take the proceeds from this sale and invest them in other assets, highlighting securitization’s effectiveness in raising capital.", "A recent study from the Michigan Technological University showed that securitization could lower the cost of capital for solar photovoltaic projects by 5 percent to 13 percent.", "Yield cos are corporate structures that are traded on stock exchanges and generate revenue by bundling existing power plants and projects that have fixed, long-term power purchase agreements with utilities.", "These financial structures are currently gaining popularity within the clean energy industry because of their ability to cheaply raise equity.", "NRG Energy launched NRG Yield in 2013 with a 1.3-gigawatt portfolio of energy generation assets, becoming the first yield co to include solar and wind resources.", "SunEdison recently launched the first pure-play solar yield co in the United States, securing $250 million from Goldman Sachs Bank USA during its initial capitalization.", "By spinning off a portfolio of projects to its newly formed yield co, SunEdison can offer stable, reliable cash flows to individual and institutional investors at lower costs and higher returns for the company.", "Similar to yield cos, REITs pool together income-producing assets and issue shares to investors, but they have generally only been used in the real estate and fossil-fuel industries to date.", "REITs are not subject to corporate taxes, which helps reduce", "the cost of raising capital.

Participants in these meetings acknowledged that Level 2 charging is favorable to fast charging because it generally requires less electricity at a particular moment in time and can be reasonably managed through time-varying rate designs.", "However, several stakeholders also noted that widespread public fast charging stations are a key consideration for consumers who are looking at buying an EV.", "In other words, while Level 2 charging has the greatest promise of providing benefits to the electric grid, those benefits depend on EV ownership and that partly depends on the perception of available public fast charging stations.", "In this case, by deploying multiple pilots as a package, Xcel Energy was able to address stakeholder interests in both types of charging infrastructure.", "Several participants in our stakeholder meetings made clear that they wanted Xcel Energy’s EV programs to be designed to incentivize charging behavior that doesn’t increase costs at peak times of electricity usage, instead incentivizing usage when renewables are producing power.", "In response to this, Xcel Energy offered a conventional two-part time-varying rate for all three of its EV pilots, with on-peak occurring from 9 a.m. to 9 p.m., and off-peak occurring from 9 p.m. to 9 a.m.", "This proposed rate design led to a two-part discussion that may be insightful to other utilities.", "First, some stakeholders wanted to see a more advanced rate design used for these pilots – one that would deploy more time periods (e.g., four time periods per day rather than two) to send more accurate price signals to customers.", "Notably, and as I’ve written about previously, Xcel Energy received approval for a more advanced residential time-varying rate design pilot in May of 2018, which has four electricity price changes in each day.", "Therefore, some stakeholders wanted to see this rate design deployed for the EV pilots. Second, for the public charging pilot, there was a concern that while the charging station owners (which, in Xcel Energy’s proposed design, will be third parties) would pay time-varying rates, the owners might not necessarily pass those rates on to the EV drivers using the charging stations, eliminating any charging behavior change that would have resulted.", "In response, the PUC allowed the conventional time-varying rate design to move forward in the interim but required Xcel Energy to come back with a more refined rate design for the fleet and public charging EV pilots within six months.", "For the public charging site hosts in particular, the PUC asked charging station operators to use time-varying rates by default, but allowed them to opt-out of doing so if warranted.", "In this particular case, the two-period time-varying rate proved unacceptable to both stakeholders and the commission.", "However, the fact that Xcel Energy had already completed some legwork to design a more advanced time-varying rate made it particularly hard to defend the two-part rate.", "Utilities developing EV programs should certainly be looking at time-varying rate designs, and, based on this experience, would do well to make the price signals in those rate designs as accurate as possible.", "Consumer impacts, including cost recovery for pilot expenses, were of significant concern in our stakeholder meetings, with some participants stressing the importance of ensuring the benefits of EV programs outweigh the costs for all customers, EV drivers and non-EV drivers alike.", "This also became a key point of discussion when the pilots were being considered by the PUC.", "The discussion centered on who should pay for the pilots, since EV infrastructure and services are in the interests of both the utility and ratepayers.", "Consumer advocates argued that, without an analysis showing the measurable benefits to all ratepayers, only the utility and participating customers should pay for the programs, as this is otherwise just a marketing initiative to sell more electricity to some customers at the expense of all.", "The Commission disagreed, stating that it asked the utilities to come forward with innovative EV pilot projects for several reasons in the public interest and this is an example of a utility following through on that request.", "Denying this request would send the wrong signal—that innovation is not rewarded. Therefore, they decided that all ratepayers should fund the pilots, as long as those expenses are shown by the utility to be reasonable and prudent.", "The Commission clarified that the decision applies only to the pilots and that one intended outcome is to gather information that can enable better cost-benefit analysis in the future.", "As part of this, they made the following decisions:", "- While the utility typically does not own and recover costs on infrastructure beyond a customer’s service connection, for the purposes of these pilots the Commission allowed Xcel Energy to classify wiring and charging equipment beyond the meter as part of their distribution system.", "- While customers benefitting from a new service line typically need to contribute to the costs of that line, for these specific pilots the Commission allowed those costs to be spread out across all ratepayers.", "- Finally, Xcel Energy is currently operating under a multi-year rate plan, which is intended to promote innovation by allowing the utility flexibility on costs over multiple years, but within certain pre-established limits.", "While some parties argued that costs for these pilots should count within those limits, Xcel Energy argued that these costs were unforeseen when the limits were established, and that they should be allowed to recover these costs beyond those limits.", "The Commission ultimately agreed, but suggested that Xcel Energy’s next multi-year rate plan should include a proposed research and development budget to avoid this happening again in the future.", "While the decisions made in this case may be unique to Xcel Energy and Minnesota, the broader lesson is that the costs and benefits of utility EV programs need to be thought through carefully, with specific attention to impacts on non-participants.", "In summary, utility EV programs offer a unique opportunity to create benefits for shareholders, consumers, and the environment, but they need to be implemented carefully and thoughtfully.", "Xcel Energy’s pilot programs in Minnesota show that finding a balance among the needs of diverse interests is difficult, but not impossible, and that that upfront stakeholder engagement can be a beneficial step towards ensuring that a utility’s final proposal is as close to acceptable as possible among the parties who will potentially advocate for or against it.", "UPDATE: There was a request submitted to the PUC to reconsider its order approving Xcel’s EV pilots. The request was denied and the denial is now being appealed.", "More information is available in MN PUC Docket 18-643."]}

As you can see in the map below, at least nine states plus Puerto Rico and D.C., have now set 100% clean energy targets.", "(For a discussion of this trend and its implications for utilities, regulators, and renewable energy developers, see AEE’s recent webinar, “What Happens When Wind and Solar Win on Price?”).", "To kick off 2019, the New Mexico Public Regulation Commission approved Public Service Co. of New Mexico’s (PNM) latest integrated resource plan (IRP), which calls for the retirement of all coal-fired generation in its portfolio by 2031.", "In Michigan, DTE Electric Co. and Consumers Energy Co. both recently proposed plans to phase out coal by 2040.", "In March, DTE proposed 11 MW of solar-plus-storage projects and 693 MW of wind projects over the next five years, followed by 525 MW of solar between 2025 and 2030 and another 2 GW by 2040.", "In June, the Public Service Commission approved Consumers’ plan, which calls for 5 GW of new solar by 2030 and a 90% reduction in carbon emissions by 2040.", "In April, Public Service Co. of Colorado received approval for the construction of a $743 million, 500 MW wind farm (representing about 8% of its peak summer demand), which the utility aims to bring into commercial operation by the end of 2020, to take advantage of the full value of the federal production tax credit.", "This represents only a small piece of the power company’s expected energy transition over the next couple decades, with the goal of achieving 100% carbon neutral generation by 2050.", "In April, Northern Indiana Public Service Co (NIPSCO) filed a petition for a $21 million annual electric revenue increase, that is premised on its most recent integrated resource plan which proposes to retire all coal in its fleet by 2028 and replace it with a portfolio of solar, storage, wind and demand management.", "NIPSCO stated its plan is expected to save customers $4 billion over the next 30 years.", "In June, Georgia Power reached a settlement agreement in its 2019 Integrated Resource Plan that calls for the retirement of close to 1 GW of coal generating capacity and the procurement of 1.5 GW of renewable resources and 150 MW of distributed generation resources.", "This plan marks the continued steep decline in Georgia Power’s emissions in recent years driven by plant economics, as these planned retirements are in addition to 3.1 GW of already retired coal plants — representing about 20% of its existing peak load.", "Even Mississippi, which historically has not been a hot bed for renewables, is joining the party. At the beginning of the year, Entergy Mississippi filed an application for a $138 million, 100 MW solar facility.", "Entergy said they are pursuing the solar facility because of increasing customer interest and the recent reductions in solar costs.", "If approved, it would be the first large-scale, utility-owned solar project constructed in Mississippi.", "Many states are exploring changes to the traditional cost-of-service regulatory model to move toward a system that better reflects new market conditions, allows utilities to take advantage of the growing service economy, and rewards performance against established goals rather than inputs.", "For more information, take a look at the Navigating Utility Business Model Reform paper and series of case studies AEE Institute released in November, in collaboration with Rocky Mountain Institute and America's Power Plan.", "The case studies highlight utility business model reforms being implemented in the U.S and abroad while the paper lays out a menu of business model reform options and practical guidance for pursuing reform at the state level.", "In January, the Minnesota Public Utilities Commission (PUC) finalized Phase 1 in its performance based regulation (PBR) investigation for the state’s largest utility — Xcel Energy.", "The Commission kicked off Phase 2 in March, which commenced a stakeholder process to create a set of metrics for the five performance outcomes established in Phase 1 – affordability, reliability, customer service quality, environmental performance, and cost-effectively aligning generation to load.", "In January, New York’s Con Edison filed a petition to increase its annual electric and gas delivery revenues.", "A key component of the rate case is the implementation of earnings adjustment mechanisms (EAMs) -- New York’s version of performance incentive mechanisms -- coming out of the Reforming the Energy Vision (REV) initiative.", "The Public Utilities Commission of Hawaii (PUC) concluded Phase 1 and set the groundwork for Phase 2 in its proceeding to develop a new PBR framework for the Hawaiian Electric Companies.", "In May, the PUC issued a Phase 1 decision which identified 12 key outcomes and a portfolio of priority PBR mechanisms for updating Hawaii's regulatory design.", "The Decision established the guiding principles and objectives for Phase 2 to include: (1) setting a revenue target to optimize near-term customer savings; (2) enhancing customer engagement; (3) improving DER performance; (4) streamlining utility performance; and (5) re-aligning financial incentives with societal outcomes (e.g., GHG reductions, transportation electrification, resilience).", "Phase 2 will formally begin in August and focus on revenue adjustment mechanisms and performance mechanisms as the main track for exploring and developing PBR.", "The Colorado Public Utilities Commission will also soon be engaged in re-thinking utility regulation with the passage of SB 236 — the PUC Sunset bill signed into law in May.", "Among other things, the bill requires the PUC to study the impacts of performance-based metrics to better understand and identify mechanisms that would encourage the state’s utilities to make investment decisions that benefit the public good, increase energy savings, and improve safety and reliability.", "The bill also authorizes the creation of a ratepayer-backed bonding mechanism (securitization) to expedite the closure of outmoded power plants as the state transitions to cleaner, more economic resources.", "In addition to these efforts to rethink utility business models and regulation on a broad basis, many states have taken on specific aspects of reforming how utilities conduct their planning and operations, such as distribution system planning (see #3) and procuring non-wires alternatives to traditional utility investments (see #4).", "3. Distribution System Planning for Distributed Resources", "The distribution grid is the backbone of a reliable electric system used to deliver electricity from the transmission system to individual consumers.", "Modern planning processes are critical for providing essential electric service efficiently and cost-effectively.", "As DER deployment continues to grow, utilities and DER companies are seeking ways to maximize the benefits of DERs to the system, while maintaining reliability and reasonable costs for customers.", "New York and California have continued to refine their distribution system planning processes in 2019, while several additional states have taken steps to implement processes of their own.", "In February, the New Hampshire Public Utilities Commission staff issued a report with a recommended approach for utilities to assess their distribution systems, conduct least-cost distribution planning strategies, and incorporate grid modernization initiatives.", "In April, Ohio's utilities (AEP Ohio, Duke Energy, and FirstEnergy) filed their grid architecture status reports, as required by the Public Utility Commission of Ohio's PowerForward roadmap, to identify where each utility stands on its path to a modern grid.", "The reports differ widely from utility to utility. Most notably, FirstEnergy's report is noticeably shorter and less comprehensive than the other utilities' reports.", "That said, topics in the reports range from a status report on grid architecture (i.e., field automation, substation automation, operational communications infrastructure, sensing and measurement, operational analytics, and standardized access to customer energy usage data) to an assessment of distribution system planning practices and ability to integrate new technologies.", "In addition to the actions mentioned above, a few other states have continued their existing distribution system planning investigations in 2019, including Hawaii, Michigan, and Minnesota.", "One of the core outputs of distribution system planning is recognizing opportunities for new advanced technologies and services to meet system needs — which we explore next.", "4. Non-Wires Alternatives to Traditional Utility Investments", "Non-wires alternatives (NWAs) to traditional investments in transmission and distribution equipment are increasingly being looked to as viable options in several key states.", "The next steps to making NWAs a widespread reality are to (1) identify the areas where NWAs can meet a need at a lower cost than a traditional utility investment, and (2) develop a framework to implement and/or procure the NWA solution.", "Several states have made significant progress so far in 2019.", "In January 2019, Con Edison in New York outlined its plan to continue implementation of its Brooklyn Queens Demand Management (BQDM) program through 2021.", "The utility plans to continue procurement of additional load reduction above the original 41 MW of non-traditional customer-side electricity demand reduction solutions (projecting 44.5 MW by 2021) and 11 MW of non-traditional utility-side solutions (projecting 18 MW by 2021).", "For a deep dive on the BQDM program and its success so far, see AEE’s case study here.", "In June 2018, Central Maine Power and Emera Maine filed recommendations that would eliminate their existing incentive to favor transmission and distribution (T&D) investments over NWAs.", "Specifically, they called for: 1) a revenue decoupling mechanism, 2) a ratemaking approach to treat NWA investments in a similar manner to T&D investments, and 3) an approval process for NWA proposals.", "As a follow-on to those recommendations, the utilities were ordered to submit supplemental filings in March outlining how they consider and implement NWAs are part of their T&D investment planning processes.", "In May, the California Public Utilities Commission issued a ruling modifying the distribution investment deferral framework process, an annual process (first implemented in 2018) to identify, review, and select opportunities for third party-owned DERs to defer or avoid traditional capital investments.", "As part of the ruling, the CPUC streamlined the planning process to reduce the time associated with stakeholder participation.", "The Commission ordered utilities to file their grid needs assessment – identifying the technical and operational planning needs they need to meet five-year load growth forecasts – and a distribution deferral opportunity report – identifying utilities’ planned investments and opportunities for third party-owned DERs to avoid or defer those investments by August.", "5. Wildfire Liability Challenging California Utilities", "In January, the largest investor-owned utility in California — Pacific Gas & Electric (PG&E) — filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy because of accrued liabilities resulting from the devastating wildfires of 2018.", "As part of the bankruptcy process, PG&E sought and received approval for $5.5 billion in financing to support operations and ongoing safety initiatives during the bankruptcy process.", "There are still a lot of unanswered questions that will need to be sorted out through the courts. One of the most important questions for the advanced energy industry will be whether PG&E is granted the ability to renegotiate a portion of their existing $34.5 billion in renewable energy contracts to help pay down their debts.", "A decision that could encumber California’s efforts to meet its clean energy and greenhouse gas reduction goals.", "Outside of the bankruptcy process, the wildfires kick started wide ranging investigations into wildfire prevention and cost recovery plans, as well as PG&E’s safety culture.", "At the start of the year, the California Public Utilities Commission opened an investigation to determine if PG&E, as currently constituted, is able to provide safe electric and gas service and to review alternatives to PG&E's current management and operational structures.", "As a result of that investigation, the Commission established a Commission Advisory Panel of experts to advise the Commission on corporate governance issues to ensure that utilities are prioritizing safety moving forward.", "More pointedly, the Commission in late June introduced four proposals (which the Commission is currently seeking comments on) to improve PG&E’s safety culture.", "The four proposed pathways include: (1) separating PG&E into separate gas and electric utilities or selling the gas assets; (2) establishing periodic review of PG&E’s Certificate of Convenience and Necessity (CPCN) to operate as a monopoly in California; (3) modifying or eliminating PG&E's holding company structure; and (4) linking PG&E’s rate of return or return on equity to safety performance metrics.", "If adopted, any one of these pathways would have wide-ranging implications.", "Also in June, the CPUC adopted a set of criteria and a methodology for conducting a financial “stress test” for future wildfire cost recovery.", "The methodology is intended to inform determinations of the maximum amount an electric corporation can pay without affecting their ability to raise money in capital markets, which could ultimately harm ratepayers or affect their ability to provide safe and adequate service.", "As renewable energy has become more competitive on price, customers are increasingly looking for ways to not only power their operations with 100% renewable energy, but also dampen price volatility and reduce energy costs.", "There are several avenues for customers to increase their access to renewable energy ranging from direct access programs to renewable energy tariffs to community solar programs.", "(For a discussion of best practices and steps that states and utilities can take to meet large customer demand for renewable energy, see the Advanced Energy Buyers Group’s recent report here.)", "In January, Xcel Energy in Minnesota filed for approval to expand their Renewable*Connect Pilot Program (a renewable energy tariff aimed at businesses that want access to renewable energy) into a full-fledged program.", "Xcel stated that the pilot sold out in one year and there are more than 400 customers on a waiting list.", "In March, the California Public Utilities Commission opened a rulemaking to implement SB 237, reopening of the state’s direct access (DA) program.", "The DA program, which has been limited to about 11% of peak load since 2010, allows retail nonresidential customers to purchase electricity service directly from competitive providers.", "In June, the Commission issued a Phase 1 order to expand the DA cap by 4 TWh or an additional 2% to 3% of peak load allocated proportionally to the investor-owned utilities' service territories.", "Phase 2, which is expected to begin before the end of the year, will be focused on the second requirement of SB 237, issuing recommendations to the Legislature on a full expansion of the DA cap to nonresidential customers by June 1, 2020.", "In May, Dominion Energy In Virginia filed an application for a 100% renewable energy tariff that would allow customers with under 5 MW of peak demand to receive 100% of their energy and capacity from a portfolio of renewable resources owned or procured by Dominion for a premium over standard service.", "In March, Florida Power & Light (FP&L) proposed a solar subscription program — SolarTogether. The program would give customers of all rate classes the option to subscribe to blocks of solar capacity (with no long-term commitment) from dedicated 74.5 MW solar power plants.", "FPL stated it has already pre-registered 200 customers, totaling 1,000 MW, for the program, mostly from commercial and industrial customers.", "Community choice aggregation (CCA) or municipal aggregation has been around for a few decades but it has risen in popularity the past couple of years, driven in large part by communities wishing to take control over how their energy is generated.", "The concept of CCA is fairly simple. CCAs are classified as governmental entities, most often formed by cities and/or counties, that procure power on behalf of their residents.", "While the CCA provides power for residents, the designated utility still continues to provide transmission and distribution service in the area.", "In California, CPUC staff has estimated that by 2025 over 85% of California’s IOU retail load could be served by Community Choice Aggregators and other DA providers (up from about 20% today).", "On the opposite coast, New York recently refined its framework to make it easier to form CCAs, which has led to several municipalities filing implementation plans.", "In January, the Massachusetts Department of Public Utilities (DPU) opened an investigation into improving the retail electric competitive supply market in Massachusetts, including increasing customer awareness of the competitive market and the value it can provide.", "In June, the DPU established two working groups which, among other things, will focus on improvements to the Energy Switch website, including but not limited to the display of municipal aggregation products.", "This is a timely investigation, as in June, the City of Boston petitioned the DPU to approve a community choice aggregation plan to procure power on behalf of its residents.", "If approved, the plan would allow the City to solicit the necessary power in October 2019 and start service in January 2020.", "The deployment of electric vehicle (EV) charging infrastructure has risen to the fore in many jurisdictions, as improvements in technology have dramatically expanded the EV market and PUCs have continued to develop focused transportation electrification strategies.", "(For more information on what utility commissioners need to know about the accelerating EV market, see AEE’s EV issue brief.)", "California continues to lead on transportation electrification (TE), with 49% of the nation’s electric car sales originating in the Golden State.", "At the turn of the year, the California Public Utilities Commission initiated a rulemaking to provide more structure and guidance on future transportation electrification investments and to streamline the application process.", "Under California’s existing construct, all utility applications have been considered on a case-by-case basis, which has led to a prolonged review process and unfocused investment strategy.", "This new process, referred to as the DRIVE OIR, seeks to develop a TE framework that will help to strategically integrate TE load; enhance market coordination of utility investments; enable private sector investments; achieve policy cohesiveness on key issues (i.e., rate design, consumer education, and vehicle-grid integration (VGI) policy); and evaluate cost effectiveness of investments and different ownership and cost recovery models.", "A staff proposal for a TE framework is expected to be issued in October.", "In January, the Public Service Commission of Wisconsin opened an investigation to consider policies and regulations in regards to EVs and their associated supply infrastructure in Wisconsin.", "In February, the Missouri Public Service Commission opened a proceeding to evaluate potential mechanisms for utility involvement in EV charging stations.", "The proceeding seeks to evaluate the following three models: (1) utility owned and operated charging stations; (2) a utility “make ready” option; and (3) an alternative incentive program where program parameters, implementation, and cost recovery would be evaluated and defined in a future rate proceeding.", "In February, the New York Public Service Commission issued an order approving a proposed incentive program to encourage the deployment of public direct current fast charging (DCFC) stations.", "The consensus proposal – which was jointly filed by the state's utilities, the New York Power Authority, the Department of Environmental Conservation, the Department of Transportation, the New York State Thruway Authority, and the New York State Energy Research and Development Authority (NYSERDA) – will provide $31.6 million in incentives for over 1,000 publicly accessible DCFC charging stations.", "Specifically, each utility will offer an annual per-plug incentive that will decline over time as electric vehicle usage, and thus DCFC utilization, increases.", "In June, the Vermont Public Utility Commission submitted a report to the state legislature recommending the removal of barriers to the adoption of EVs, including more EV purchase incentives, easier pathways for the installation of public charging infrastructure, and increased education and outreach.", "The Arizona Corporation Commission (ACC) has also been in the thick of developing an EV policy implementation plan in 2019 that provides guidelines for utilities to propose EV pilot programs focused on structure, education and outreach, make-ready, rate design, incentives/rebates, and cost recovery.", "There has been no shortage of activity across the country with utility proposals or statewide investigations in Colorado, Delaware, Iowa, Maryland, Michigan (DTE Electric and Consumers Energy) Minnesota, North Carolina, Oregon, South Carolina (Duke Energy Progress and Duke Energy Carolinas), and Texas.", "For an overview of the benefits of electrifying transportation, with a specific focus on the medium- and heavy-duty vehicle sector, see our recently released industry fact sheet here.", "9. Grid Modernization Investments for DER and Large-Scale Renewables", "Grid modernization is often used in the electricity industry as a catch-all term for grid investment.", "However, at AEE, we view grid modernization as comprising the foundational investments needed to enable a reliable and flexible grid.", "Such a modern grid platform is essential to fully integrating DER, balancing increasing levels of large-scale renewables and enhancing the customer experience.", "The first step toward grid modernization is often advanced metering infrastructure. In May, Indiana Michigan Power took this first step by filing an application in Indiana as part of a larger general rate case asking for full smart meter deployment by 2022.", "Other states are looking at grid modernization more holistically. In March, the Arkansas Public Service Commission kicked off a long-awaited DER and grid modernization investigation.", "The first phase of the investigation will inform stakeholders on the existing state of the grid, including aging distribution infrastructure, the role of data in a modern grid, and the impact of DER on utility planning and operation.", "Meanwhile in the District of Columbia, six working groups with over 100 participants across industry, government, consulting, and advocacy groups met from August 2018 to May 2019, working through a variety of issues facing its electric power system.", "The collaborative process focused on identifying technologies and policies that can modernize its energy delivery system for increased sustainability and make it more reliable, efficient, cost-effective and interactive.", "In May, the process culminated in a final stakeholder report with 32 recommendations (i.e., more fundamental reforms that require further discussion) for consideration by the PSC related to data and information access and alignment, non-wire alternatives, rate design, utility business model reform, customer impacts, microgrids, and pilot projects.", "Net energy metering (NEM) has been successful in spurring the adoption of distributed generation across the country.", "As net metering-eligible resources continue to decline in price, the number of NEM customers has increased, which has led to pushback in many jurisdictions.", "Over the past couple of years, states have taken various approaches to successor tariffs to NEM, ranging from reductions in net metering rates for exported electricity to the development of regulatory structures to more precisely value and source services from DER (see #10, of last year’s Top 10).", "This year, one example of the holistic approach to NEM reconsideration can be found in Connecticut, where in June the Department of Energy and Environmental Protection (DEEP) and the Public Utilities Regulatory Authority (PURA) opened a proceeding to study the value of DER as required by Public Act 19-35.", "DEEP and PURA are required to submit a report on their findings to the General Assembly by July 2020.", "Other states, however, seem to be moving in a direction that is not favorable to future DER adoption.", "In January, the Louisiana Public Service Commission Staff proposed a rule that would compensate new net metering customers at avoided cost, rather than the retail rate, though also promising payment for any quantifiable locational, capacity-related, or environmental benefits.", "In April, Idaho Power filed a petition to suspend net metering service and explore modifications to the compensation structure under its net metering program, affecting customer-owned generation facilities with capacity up to 100 kW, even though existing net metered capacity represents just 0.15% of the utility’s summer peak demand of 3,400 MW.", "Idaho Power expressed concern that capacity under its net metering tariff had increased 114% in the first quarter of 2019 alone, driven by large commercial, industrial, and irrigation customers, with capacity from the irrigation class jumping from 1.09 MW to 5.06 MW.", "No decision has been made to date, but if the Public Utilities Commission sides with the utility, it could nip Idaho distributed generation in the bud.", "On a more positive note, New York recently made some landmark adjustments that should provide fairer treatment for customers that have significant distributed generation facilities.", "In April, the Commission issued an order that made revisions to the state’s DER value calculation and compensation methodology, and also adopted a new credit to encourage community distributed generation development.", "And in May, the Commission issued an order modifying the current standby and buyback service rates that will improve the alignment between system costs and how DER customers make use of the grid, which should ultimately improve the prospects for DER deployment.", "(For a more detailed look at this order, read more here.)", "Keep up-to-date on all regulatory action with AEE's PowerSuite.

Utility solar also saw slight annual contraction, due to the impacts of Section 201 tariff uncertainty earlier in the year and shifting project timelines based on the tariff schedule.", "Overall, in 2018, solar PV has accounted for 29% of new electricity generating capacity additions – a lower share compared to 2017 due to a surge in new natural-gas plants in early 2018.", "After experiencing volume contraction last year, the residential solar market regained its footing in 2018 with steadily increasing installation volumes.", "The fourth quarter of 2018 was the largest quarter for the residential segment in two years. Five quarters of modest growth now suggest the market is adopting a more sustainable growth profile with a mix of local and regional installers operating alongside national installers.", "With 2018 in the books, a few key themes have emerged about the state of the residential solar market.", "Installation growth and market penetration levels suggest major states have moved past early adopters.", "Among the highest-penetration markets in the nation, residential growth rates were mixed in 2018. The one exception to this was Nevada, which experienced 3x growth once net metering was reinstated in 2017 after being revoked in 2016, which caused the market to contract by 61% from 2016 to 2017.This political turmoil led to abnormally high installations in 2018 based on pent-up demand.", "Outside the stabilizing large markets, growth in low-penetration emerging markets, such as Texas and Florida, continues to add to the geographic diversity of the residential market outside of California and the Northeast.", "Legacy markets are no longer the primary engines of growth. Though California is forecasted to be the largest market for the foreseeable future due to the sheer size of the state, the regional growth landscape began to shift and diversify in 2018.", "Of the top 10 markets in 2017, six markets experienced annual contraction in 2018 while two experienced double-digit percentage growth.", "Meanwhile, a handful of states are leapfrogging developed markets. Both Texas and Florida saw installations that surpassed legacy markets Maryland and Massachusetts last year, signaling new state-level leadership on residential solar development.", "In 2018, we saw a pivot away from legacy, incentive-driven markets and the emergence of low-penetration markets with limited third-party ownership options, good PV resources, and low electricity rates – a trend we expect to continue.", "Residential PV continues to be constrained by high costs of customer acquisition. Outside of overhead and margin, customer-acquisition costs remain the highest expense for installers of all sizes averaging 20% of the total system pricing.", "This reaffirms our view that at existing prices, sales and marketing is a vital part of continued residential market development.", "High customer-acquisition costs are directly related to high overall cost of installation, which also suggests a virtuous cycle of reduced costs.", "One target area for the industry to reduce costs is through streamlining the permitting and inspection processes, as permitting delays lead to customer attrition and other expenses.", "SEIA and the Solar Foundation, along with numerous companies, are working together to address these issues.", "New construction and roof replacement markets also represent an opportunity to address both customer-acquisition and permitting costs.", "However, at existing price levels, the high cost of customer-acquisition will slow growth in the near-term.", "Incentives and net metering remain important market enablers but show diminishing rates of return.

The California Energy Commission’s decision in early 2018 to require solar PV on all new homes beginning in 2020 significantly insulates our long-term forecasts by adding an additional gigawatt of residential demand from 2020-2024E. While it remains to be seen whether other states will follow suit, some municipalities have created solar mandates for new buildings.", "Meanwhile, major national installers are spending considerable resources building relationships with housing developers to comply with California’s mandate while also aiming to capitalize on one-off housing developments outside of state mandates.", "With several newly announced entrants into the space, new home solar, whether mandated or voluntary, could provide an opportunity to bridge the cost of customer acquisition gap that has constrained growth.", "Unlike the case of residential PV, a handful of state-specific regulatory cliffs and policy reforms took effect in 2018, which led to a decline in non-residential build-out in the major markets of California and Massachusetts.", "Despite California’s market falling 17% year-over-year, the decline was not as severe as previously anticipated, as the extent of California’s pipeline of projects grandfathered in under solar-friendly time-of-use rates has been higher than previously assumed.", "However, Massachusetts witnessed 64% year-over-year decline in capacity installed as the industry awaited the start of the Solar Massachusetts Renewable Target (SMART) program.", "Combined, these two states saw a year-over-year decrease of more than 450 MW of installed non-residential PV capacity.", "New York bucked the national trend, experiencing record installations in 2018. This was the result of a waning pipeline of grandfathered remote net-metering projects becoming interconnected, despite being constructed in 2017.", "Meanwhile, community solar continues to support non-residential PV. Minnesota and Massachusetts contributed to well over 500 MW of community solar being installed this year.", "And while we won’t begin to see projects from New Jersey’s new community solar program until late 2019 at the earliest, the state is making significant strides in establishing the program, which technically kicks off in Q1 2019.", "Utility PV continues to hold the largest share of annual installations in the U.S. solar market with a total of 6.2 GWdc in 2018, accounting for 58% of total U.S. annual capacity additions.", "Lower-than-expected installation volumes in Q4 are primarily attributed to Section 201 module tariffs set in January 2018 and implemented in February 2018, which caused project sponsors to reassess a handful of project timelines and push out target commercial operation dates (CODs) from 2018 into 2019.", "In addition to tariff-related delays, interconnection delays for PURPA projects in the Carolinas contributed to lower-than-expected Q4 deployments.", "U.S. utility solar procurement has grown considerably with a number of utilities, such as Hawaiian Electric Company and Entergy Mississippi, announcing plans to add more utility PV to their generation portfolios due to the pure economic competitiveness of solar.", "In 2018, 13.2 GWdc of utility solar PPAs were signed, driving the contracted pipeline to 28.3 GWdc – the highest point in the history of U.S. solar.", "Most of these PPAs will be fulfilled with products imported after significant declines in the Section 201 tariffs.", "Voluntary procurement remains the largest driver of new PPAs signed and is expected to drive 51% of 2019 capacity additions.", "While commercial and industrial (C&I) off takers only accounted for 153 MW of actual capacity additions in 2018, C&I procurement drove 21% of all new PPAs signed last year.", "Meanwhile, new renewable portfolio standards are poised to drive additional utility PV.", "Many utility PV projects suffered disruption, delay and even cancelation due to the uncertainty leading up to the imposition of the Section 201 tariffs.", "The impacts can be seen in the volume of installations in 2018, which were down 7% year-over-year for utility-scale PV.", "However, since the tariffs were announced, the industry has pushed out timelines to account for the tariff stepdown schedule and has benefited from faster-than-expected declines in global module pricing.", "These price declines are mostly due to changes in China’s feed-in tariff policy that has resulted in a supply glut.", "While the Section 201 tariffs are still imposing a significant opportunity cost on the U.S. solar industry, new project procurement is moving forward thanks to strong industry fundamentals.", "Cell and module tariffs dropped from 30% to 25% in February 2019. Tariffs will drop to 20% in February 2020 and 15% in February 2021 before their scheduled expiration in February 2022.", "The International Trade Commission (ITC) will conduct a mid-term review of the tariffs starting in January 2020, at which point the President will have the opportunity to continue, modify, or terminate the tariffs.", "The ITC will begin data collection for that review this summer.", "Residential installation growth exceeded expectations for 2018, largely thanks to strong showings in California, Nevada and Florida.", "Still, as major state markets continue to grow past early-adopter consumers, higher costs of customer acquisition will challenge the industry to innovate.", "Long-term growth prospects benefit from (among other factors): geographic diversification outside of legacy state markets, California’s new home solar mandate, new incentive programs such as Illinois’ Adjustable Block Program, and technological/business model innovation to improve product offerings into solar-plus-storage.", "In 2018, the non-residential sector benefited from a large pipeline of projects grandfathered in under more favorable compensation policies in California and Massachusetts.", "California experienced commercial solar build-out in 2018, stemming from developers rushing to install projects to meet a (since-lifted) deadline to be grandfathered in under solar-friendly time-of-use rates.", "Meanwhile, New York saw its largest year ever for commercial installations as the remaining pipeline of remote net-metering projects came online.", "However, the delayed opening of the SMART program in Massachusetts resulted in that state seeing 325 MW less capacity installed in 2018 than in the record-breaking 2017.", "Additionally, the build-out of Xcel Energy’s robust community solar pipeline in Minnesota still accounts for a significant share of non-residential growth, with nearly 300 MWdc added in 2018.", "In total, Minnesota accounted for over 80% of the community solar build-out in 2018, while Massachusetts accounted for much of the remainder.", "Though the community solar market didn’t quite outpace 2017 capacity, last year marked the second consecutive year of over 500 MW of community solar installed.", "Utility PV continues to hold the largest share of annual installations in the U.S. solar market.

Many of the newly elected governors are in states that have joined the U.S. Climate Alliance or campaigned on a pledge to join the Alliance and commit to the Paris Agreement in lieu of federal participation.", "Six of the governors have proposed increases to RPS targets, while three (Colorado, Nevada, and Illinois) have proposed 100% RPS mandates.", "This is in addition to California’s 100% RPS, Hawaii’s 100% RPS, and New York’s 50% RPS. If all states where elected governors campaigned on RPS increases were to achieve 50% RPS compliance by 2030, it could drive up to 37.0 GWdc of additional solar.", "Wood Mackenzie’s utility PV five-year forecast has increased 2.3 GWdc since our last report as more projects are announced, utilities include more solar in long-term resource planning, and development is driven increasingly by C&I offtakers.", "For residential PV, after seeing 7% growth in 2018, we expect flat to tempered growth in 2019, primarily due to major market maturation resulting in limited long-term growth opportunities in major Northeast markets.", "Meanwhile, the approval of a super off-peak rate in Southern California Edison territory – the second-largest utility in the nation for solar PV – takes effect in 2019, which severely limits the economic attractiveness of solar-only products.", "That said, growth resumes in 2020-2021 as the ITC step-down is expected to pull in demand in both legacy and emerging markets before declining in 2022.", "Growth resumes in 2023 and continues into 2024 based on economic fundamentals as the market adjusts to the post-ITC reality.", "In the long-term, residential capacity growth will be driven by California’s new home solar mandate – with upside potential from other states adopting similar mandates – a robust incentive program in Illinois, emerging markets like Texas and Florida becoming the new engines of retrofit growth, and the proliferation of solar-plus-storage.", "Meanwhile, the non-residential PV market is on track for another down year as the segment acclimates to a reduced incentive environment across major state markets in 2019.", "However, this will be incrementally offset starting in 2020 as the next wave of states with robust community solar mandates – New York, Maryland, Illinois and New Jersey – begin to see the realization of those pipelines.", "Increasing solar-plus-storage viability will also begin to have an impact on non-residential demand.", "By 2023, roughly 30% of non-residential PV will come from community solar, and ~20% will come from solar-plus-storage projects.", "By 2020, 28 states in the U.S. are expected to have 100+ MWdc annual solar markets, with 25 of those states being home to more than 1 GWdc of operating solar PV.", "This compares to only two states with 100+ MWdc annual solar markets in 2010.", "Forecast details by state (43 states plus Washington, D.C.) and market segment through 2024 are available in the full report.", "U.S. solar market insightÂ® is a quarterly publication of Wood Mackenzie Power & Renewables, Inc. d/b/a Greentech Media and the Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA)Â®.", "Each quarter, we collect granular data on the U.S. solar market from nearly 200 utilities, state agencies, installers and manufacturers.", "This data provides the backbone of this U.S. solar market insightÂ® report, in which we identify and analyze trends in U.S. solar demand, manufacturing and pricing by state and market segment.", "We also use this analysis to look forward and forecast demand over the next five years.

A meta-analysis found a modest increase in risk with increasing BMI, RR=1.05 (95% CI 1.01–1.08) per five unit increase in BMI (2).", "However, analyses by grade and stage suggest that obesity is more strongly associated with advanced PCa and unassociated with or perhaps even protective against localized or low-grade disease (2,5,10).", "However, obesity is associated with lower PSA, a thorough digital rectal exam may be more difficult to complete in obese men, and obesity is related to larger prostate size and potentially reduced sensitivity for biopsy based diagnoses (11–14).", "Therefore interpretation of the extant literature on obesity and PCa incidence is complex(13).", "It has been argued that because prostate size is larger among overweight and obese men as compared to normal weight men the diagnostic accuracy of biopsies for detecting prostate cancer is lower in overweight and obese men.", "This in turn effects epidemiologic studies of obesity and PCa risk that may suffer from diagnostic bias with under-diagnosis of small non-aggressive tumors among obese men(13,15–17).", "Within a studied PCa case-series, the sub-group of men with larger prostates and higher BMI may include a higher percentage of men diagnosed with aggressive tumors whose tumors were missed at prior biopsies when the tumors were smaller and/or less aggressive(13).", "This phenomena would lead to an overestimate of the association between obesity and diagnosis of aggressive prostate tumors and an underestimate of the association between obesity and non-aggressive PCa.", "Furthermore, depending on the underlying distribution of aggressive and non-aggressive cancers in population the study draws cases from, this type of diagnostic bias could lead to a failure to observe a link between obesity and overall PCa risk.", "Past research that has incorporated measures of prostate size into studies of obesity and PCa have derived cross-sectional case-control studies from series of men undergoing biopsy during a specified time period; men whose biopsy returns a finding of cancer are cases and men whose biopsy returns a benign finding are treated as controls(15–17).", "In these studies prostate size is measured at the time of biopsy when case-control status was ascertained(15–17).", "However, it is not clear that these biopsy series studies and data on prostate size at case-control ascertainment can be used to appropriately address potential bias caused by differences in prostate volume.", "With cross-sectional case-control studies derived from biopsy series the underlying at-risk cohort that produces the cases and controls is not defined and dynamic processes leading up to the enumeration period for the biopsy series, including prior biopsy history and changes in prostate size with aging, are not observed.", "Men in the underlying at-risk cohort with smaller prostates and growing tumors are more likely to be diagnosed at a biopsy occurring prior to the enumeration period used in any given biopsy series study, than men with larger prostates and growing tumors.", "This “early detection” is an event that would have removed the man from consideration during the enumeration period of a given biopsy series study but would have been an observed event in a prospective cohort study.", "Further complicating matters, an enlarged prostate may itself be the factor that brings a man to medical attention and biopsy.", "Thus in a biopsy series derived case-control study, risk for biopsy, obesity, prostate size at diagnosis, diagnostic accuracy and case-control ascertainment are likely entangled.", "It is not clear that adjustment or stratification for prostate size at diagnosis in a biopsy series study fully addresses the potential for selection bias caused by differences in prostate volume.", "Additionally, it is not clear how prostate size at diagnosis should be conceptualized in a data analysis of obesity and different levels of PCa risk.", "Prostate size at diagnosis has variously been conceptualized as a confounder or as an effect modifier of associations between obesity and PCa risk(15–17).", "Freedland et al, found that prostate size at case-control ascertainment was an inverse confounder that caused observed associations between obesity and PCa to be biased towards the null(16).", "However, Fowke et al., conceptualized prostate size at case-control ascertainment as an effect modifier and observed associations between obesity and aggressive PCa only among men with smaller prostates at diagnosis(15,17).", "Here using a prospective cohort design we measured prostate size at entry into the cohort and assessed its role as an effect modifier or confounder of the relationship between obesity and PCa risk.", "This nested case-control study has been extensively described previously(8).

The presence of any notation in the medical record of a family history of PCa in the subject’s father or brothers was used to indicate a positive family history.", "Data on all PSA tests were abstracted and the PSA test value immediately prior to the initial benign procedure at the HFHS was used as the base-line PSA level.", "If a PSA test result immediately prior to the initial benign procedure was not available, the PSA level measured at the first PSA test subsequent to the procedure was used.", "Screening intensity was measured as the frequency of PSA tests and digital rectal exams (DRE) during follow-up; for cases the period between cohort entry and diagnosis was examined and for controls the period between cohort entry and matching date (corresponding to the time interval between the initial procedure and diagnosis for the matched case) was examined.", "Medical record data on height and weight measured closest to the initial benign procedure was used to calculate body mass index (BMI) and overweight (BMI ≥ 25 and <30) and obese status (BMI ≥ 30) at the beginning of follow-up.", "Data on covariates and BMI were available from 495 case-control pairs.", "Prostate size at biopsy was recorded in the pathology records in several ways, prostate volume, prostate dimensions in three axis or prostate weight; in some instances no data on prostate size was recorded.", "When prostate volume data was unavailable prostate volume was estimated from the reported prostate dimensions as (dimension 1 x dimension 2 x dimension 3) x (3.14/6).", "When volume and dimension data were not available, prostate weight was used to estimate volume; the density of the prostate is approximately 1 gram/cm3.", "For the 456 subjects where dimension and volume data were recorded the correlation between calculated prostate volume and recorded volume was 0.93 and for the 95 subjects where dimension and weight data were recorded the correlation between calculated prostate volume and volume estimated by weight was 0.97.", "Of the 495 case-control pairs with covariate and BMI data, 387 case-control pairs had prostate volume data or dimension or weight data from which prostate volume could be estimated.", "Pathology data from the tumors were used to classify cases as having high (Gleason score >=7; 4 primary, 3 secondary) or low grade tumors.", "Advanced stage disease was defined as pathologic or clinical stage T3a and higher.

It is possible that LAG-3 expression on iNKT cells directly regulates IL-10 production, but perhaps more likely that the relationship with IL-10 reflects cross-talk between iNKT cells and other IL-10-producing lymphocyte subsets such as Tregs or neutrophils, both of which can interact with iNKTs", "[67,68]. Given that IL-10 can correlate with viral load [69], it is also possible that this relationship reflects a dependence of LAG-3 expression on disease progression, although that seems less likely given the lack of correlation between LAG-3 and CD4 count in this cohort.", "Unlike Tim-3 [70], LAG-3 was not highly expressed on any NK cell subset. The differences in LAG-3 expression between NK subsets, however, warrant further investigation.", "Although LAG-3 expression was not elevated on CD56-CD16+ NK cells among HIV+ participants, its expression was highest on this subset among healthy controls.", "The expansion of this subset during HIV infection has been documented [71], and LAG-3 could contribute to the anergic phenotype observed among these cells.", "In contrast to the T cell, and to some extent NK cell, subsets, LAG-3 was expressed at moderate levels on iNKT cells, particularly among the HIV-infected participants.", "In some patients, up to 40% of the iNKT population was LAG-3+, raising the possibility that iNKT cell function may be regulated by LAG-3 to a greater extent than other lymphocyte populations.", "iNKT cells express surface markers characteristic of both T and NK cells and respond to lipid antigen presentation by CD1d.", "Despite the low frequency of the iNKT population in the periphery (0.01 – 1% of CD3+ lymphocytes in humans), iNKT activity is now appreciated to play an important role in immunity to infectious diseases [72].", "During chronic HIV infection, the CD4+ iNKT subset is depleted [28,29], as observed in our present cohort.", "While some cohorts report full recovery of both CD4+ and CD4- iNKT subsets following ART [31], others report no effect of therapy", "[28,30] similar to the lack of CD4+ iNKT reconstitution seen during this study.", "Surprisingly, the increase in LAG-3 expression did not correspond to increased PD-1 expression, in contrast to another report by Moll et al.", "[30]. In both cohorts, iNKT PD-1 expression was several-fold higher than T cell PD-1 expression, but PD-1 was more readily detected on both cell subsets in our cohort.", "Differences in cohort ethnicity could contribute to the contrasting observations, but it is also plausible that the use of the EH12.2H7 anti-PD-1 clone coupled to the extremely bright Brilliant Violet 421 fluorochrome enabled more sensitive detection of PD-1 expression in this study than other clones and fluorochromes.", "To determine the impact of iNKT LAG-3 expression, we assessed functional iNKT cytokine production capacity in the Majengo cohort.", "Studies of iNKT function during HIV infection and treatment in the literature suffer from lack of replication in multiple cohorts, and the only functional study performed in an African cohort reported only PMA/Io-stimulated cytokine production from ART-naïve subjects [33].", "The decrease in αGalCer-induced IFNγ expression is similar to other cohorts, but the lack of functional reconstitution among ART experienced participants in this cohort is concerning [30,34].", "Data on iNKT recovery during ART is inconsistent, as some studies suggest an improvement of iNKT cytokine production following ART", "[32,73], while other studies have failed to find ART-based improvement of iNKT function [30], or have not differentiated between treated and untreated subjects [34].", "In this study, the ex vivo expression of LAG-3 on the iNKT subset inversely correlated with IFNγ secretion as measured by ICS following αGalCer stimulation.", "The consistent relationship between LAG-3 expression and IFNγ secretion for both CD4+ and CD4- iNKTs suggests a similar consequence of LAG-3 expression on both subsets, despite differences in IFNγ production between subsets in healthy individuals.", "The inhibitory activity of LAG-3 on iNKT IFNg expression was further confirmed by the demonstration that LAG-3+ iNKTs are highly unlikely to produce IFNγ following PMA/Io stimulation.", "The association of LAG-3, but not PD-1, with iNKT dysfunction during HIV infection is broadly consistent with a previous study of iNKT PD-1 expression [30].", "Although PD-1 expression was elevated among HIV-infected subjects in that cohort, its expression did not correlate with cytokine production or proliferation, and blocking of the PD-1/PD-L1 pathway did not improve proliferation or IFNγ secretion.", "To date, the contribution of other exhaustion markers (Tim-3, CD160, 2B4) to iNKT function during HIV infection has not been defined.", "The contribution of Tim-3 to iNKT inhibition during herpes simplex virus infection was assessed, but found to be not responsible for the defects in cytokine secretion [74].", "The only surface marker previously demonstrated to inversely correlate with iNKT cytokine production during HIV infection is the costimulatory molecule CD161 [34].", "CD161 is expressed by a variable, but generally high, proportion of iNKT cells [34,75,76]. The regulatory nature of CD161 on iNKT cells has not been fully clarified, as CD161+ iNKT cells are more likely to produce IFNγ and TNFα than CD161- cells in healthy individuals [76,77].", "Our study, however, did not assess CD161 expression and therefore cannot confirm or rule out a contribution of CD161 upregulation to iNKT dysfunction.", "To complement the ICS data, we also assessed cytokine/chemokine expression in cell culture supernatant after 5 days of αGalCer stimulation.", "In this assay, the background subtracted supernatant protein levels represent both iNKT cytokine expression and protein expression by other cell subsets in response to iNKT activation.", "As such, this data represents the downstream, cumulative impact of lipid stimulation/iNKT activation in a mixed culture.", "Give that iNKT activation is known to regulate a large number of other cell types, and that the functional impact of LAG-3 expression (which binds MHCII proteins) can only be truly assessed when MHCII-expressing cells are present, measuring cytokines in a whole PBMC culture may be more relevant than sorting and isolating iNKT cells.", "The correlation between iNKT frequency and analyte concentration strongly suggests that the measured analyte levels are iNKT-induced.", "Overall, several patterns emerged from analysis of cytokine/chemokine expression levels and correlations.", "Among HIV-N participants, IFNγ and IL-13 were the major cytokines produced in culture after IP-10. IFN-γ is a hallmark cytokine produced upon αGalCer stimulation, and IL-13 is produced by activated iNKT cells and directs monocyte to DC differentiation", "[78]. The loss of IL-13 secretion among HIV+ participants likely reflects, at least partially, the depletion of the CD4+ iNKT subset, which is reportedly the sole iNKT subset to produce IL-13 [64,79].", "In contrast, cytokine production among HIV+ ART naïve participants was mostly limited to IP-10 and MIP-1α/β production.", "The ART experienced group never produced significantly higher levels of any analyte compared the ART naïve group, and showed little evidence of iNKT reconstitution.", "These data suggest that in addition to a lack of reconstitution of iNKT function among ART experienced patients, the cytokine production profile is altered in comparison to both HIV-N and ART-naïve subjects.", "The correlations between sLAG-3 production and cytokine/chemokine concentrations among all study groups suggest that sLAG-3 may simply be a marker of iNKT activation.", "There is no evidence that increasing concentrations of sLAG-3 in culture results in inhibition of cytokine production.", "The lack of production of sLAG-3 in HIV+ ART naïve, but not ART-treated, participants is distinct compared to other cytokine/chemokine responses, which were generally absent in the ART treated group.", "The production of sLAG-3 by iNKT cells following stimulation has not been described in the literature, and represents a significant gap in knowledge.", "The correlation between LAG-3 expression and supernatant IFNγ at 5 days post-stimulation is consistent with the ICS results described above.", "It is important to note, however, that changes in LAG-3 expression during culture, and the contribution of other PBMC cell subsets to cytokine production make a direct link between LAG-3 expression and long-term cytokine production difficult.", "The positive correlations between PD-1 expression and cytokine production also suggest that PD-1 may indicate a more activated, rather than exhausted, iNKT phenotype.", "In conclusion, we have demonstrated both short-term and long-term defects in iNKT cytokine/chemokine expression in response to lipid stimulation in a Kenyan cohort of HIV+ ART naïve and experienced women.", "Although PD-1 expression did not appear to mediate iNKT dysfunction, the elevated expression of LAG-3 was associated with an inhibition of IFNγ production, suggesting that LAG-3 at least partially regulates iNKT function during chronic infection.", "Coupled with previous observations from our lab, and others, that LAG-3 is poorly expressed on T cells during HIV infection, blockade of LAG-3 signaling may selectively restore innate immune function and, therefore, improve current treatment regimens.", "Overall, our data suggest that LAG-3 is unlikely to play a significant role in T cell immune exhaustion in an African population.", "Unexpectedly, LAG-3 upregulation during chronic HIV infection and treatment may be restricted to the iNKT innate lymphocyte subset.", "The maintenance of LAG-3 expression during ART suggests that it may contribute to the innate immune dysregulation observed among ART subjects, as well as contributing to the loss of iNKT cytokine production observed during chronic infection.", "Future studies that demonstrate the cell-intrinsic activity of LAG-3 expression will determine whether blocking LAG-3 activity could improve innate immune responses initiated by iNKT cells during HIV infection or treatment.", "This study recruited 10 HIV-uninfected, 40 HIV-infected antiretroviral naïve and 40 HIV-infected antiretroviral experienced patients from the Majengo commercial sex worker cohort located in Nairobi, Kenya.", "In a follow-up study, an additional 16 HIV-N, 9 HIV+ and 17 HIV+ ART participants were recruited.

Thus, the following food groups were included in the study: fruits, vegetables, fish (including seafood and processed seafood), meat (including cooked ham, offal), eggs, milk, cheese, added fats (including oil, butter, margarine, vinaigrette), sugary products (e.g. cake, biscuits, sugars, honey, jam, chocolate) and starchy foods (including potato, legumes, pasta, rice, other cereals) with a specific focus on legumes and whole grain starchy foods (including whole grain pasta, rice, other cereals).", "Adherence to nutritional guidelines was assessed using the PNNS Guideline Score (PNNS-GS). The 15-point PNNS-GS is a validated a priori score reflecting the adherence to the official French nutritional guidelines which has been extensively described elsewhere [44].", "Details on computation of this score are in Additional file 1. Briefly, it includes 13 components: eight refer to food-serving recommendations (fruit and vegetables; starchy foods; whole grain products; dairy products; meat, eggs and fish; fish and seafood; vegetable fat; water vs. soda), four refer to moderation in consumption (added fat; salt; sweets; alcohol) and one component pertains to physical activity [44, 45].", "Points are deducted for overconsumption of salt (>12 g/day), added sugars (>17.5% of energy intake), or when energy intake exceeds the needed energy level by more than 5%.", "Each component cut-off was that of the threshold defined by the PNNS public health objectives when available [45] otherwise they were established according to the French Recommended Dietary Allowances [46].", "For the present analysis, we consider the mPNNS-GS, a modified version of the PNNS-GS, which takes into account only the dietary components, therefore excluding the physical activity component.", "Food variety has been defined as the number of different food items reported to be eaten over a given reference period [47].", "Considering that seasonality is likely to influence food variety and that a period of 10 to 15 days has been recommended to accurately assess food variety [48], the food variety was evaluated using a Food Frequency Questionnaire (FFQ).", "Sixteen months after baseline, participants were invited to complete a self-administrated 240-items FFQ to assess their usual dietary intake over the past year [49].", "Participants were asked to report their consumption frequency on the basis of how many times they ate the standard portion size proposed (typical household measurements such as spoon or standard unit such as a yogurt).", "The frequency of consumption referred to usual consumption over the past year on an increasing scale including yearly, monthly, weekly or daily units, as suitable, and participants were asked to provide only one answer.", "The food variety score corresponded to the number of FFQ items reported to be consumed at least once during the last year [47].", "The maximum score was therefore 240.

First, meal planning might address the issue of not knowing what to prepare for dinner, that has been previously described as a barrier for home meal preparation [29].", "Second, by planning meals individuals may think about recipes that can be prepared in a limited period of time and, therefore reduce the feeling of time scarcity, that may limit home meal preparation", "[6, 12, 16] and increase the recourse to food choice coping strategies such as eating out, delivery meals or ready prepared food", "[17, 23–25].

On the 22d of June, the", "frigate \"Chesapeake,\" built by its native mechanics, launched in", "the waters of the Elizabeth River, in view of the city, put out to", "sea from Hampton Roads, under command of Captain James Barron.", "On the following day, unsuspecting of danger, she was attacked by the", "British frigate \"Leopard,\" and became her prize after three men had", "been killed, and sixteen wounded. The British commander, after taking", "from the \"Chesapeake\" certain seamen, whom he alleged were deserters", "from the British flag, declined to take possession of the captured", "frigate, which returned to the Roads. The wounded men were taken", "to the Marine Hospital, in Norfolk, where one of them died. Intense", "indignation prevailed in the city. It was believed that the outrage", "was deliberately designed, and the cry for vengeance burst from the", "whole people. In full assembly, with the venerable General Matthews", "presiding, they appointed, as in the days of '76, a Committee of Safety.", "A preamble, duly setting forth the outrage on the \"Chesapeake,\" was", "adopted, and it was resolved that there should be no intercourse with", "the British frigates in the Norfolk waters, or with their agents, until", "the decision of the United States Government was known, under the", "penalty of being deemed infamous; and the Committee of Safety—", "Thomas Matthews, Thomas Newton, Jr., Luke Wheeler, Theodric", "Armistead, Richard E. Lee, Moses Myers, William Pennock, William", "Newsum, Thomas Blanchard, Daniel Bedinger, Seth Foster, J. W.", "Murdaugh, Richard Blow, and Francis S. Taylor—were authorized to", "take such measures as the emergency demanded. As soon as the British", "commander—Commodore Douglas—read the resolves, he addressed,", "on the 3d of July, an insolent letter to the Mayor of the Borough, in", "which he declared if the resolutions were not instantly annulled, he would", "prohibit every vessel bound in or out of Norfolk from proceeding to", "her place of destination. He closed his communication by saying that", "he had proceeded with his squadron of four fifty-gun frigates to Hampton", "Roads to await the answer of the Mayor, which he hoped would be", "forwarded without delay. It is thought that Mr. Tazewell had regulated", "the popular proceedings from their initiation. In the delicate dilemma,", "which was ominous of vengeful deeds and of so much menace to the", "commercial interests of Norfolk, he came to the assistance of the Mayor", "and dictated a reply to the audacious Briton which elicited the admiration", "of the whole American Nation. The letter, written on the 4th of", "The day on which this answer is written ought of itself to prove to", "the subjects of your sovereign that the American people are not to be", "imtimidated by menace; or induced to adopt any measures except by", "a sense of their perfect propriety. Seduced by the false show of security,", "they may be sometimes surprised and slaughtered while unprepared to resist", "a supposed friend. That delusive security is now passed forever. The", "late occurrence has taught us to confide our safety no longer to any thing", "than to our own force. We do not seek hostility, nor shall we avoid it.", "We are prepared for the worst you may attempt, and will do whatever", "shall be judged proper to repel force whensoever your efforts shall render", "any acts of ours necessary. Thus much for the threats in your letter.\"", "The letter was delivered by Mr. Tazewell (who was accompanied by Tazewell", "Taylor), to Commodore Douglas, in presence of the Captains of the", "Fleet (among whom was Sir Thomas Hardy, whom Lord Nelson so", "affectionately addressed in his dying moments). It had a due effect.", "The threats were all recanted, and a letter of the 5th of July breathed", "nothing but amity and peace—an amusing somersault, like unto which is", "scarcely to be recalled in the annals of diplomacy.", "In 1816, during an absence from home, and without his knowledge,", "Mr. Tazewell was elected by the people of Norfolk to the House of Delegates.", "His speech in that body against the Convention bill, and in", "reply to General Alexander Smyth, is memorable for its ability and eloquence.", "The bill passed in the House but was lost in the Senate. In", "1820 Mr. Tazewell was one of the Commissioners under the Florida", "treaty. In 1824 he was elected to the United States Senate. He was", "elected to fill a vacancy caused by the resignation of John Taylor of", "Caroline. It is a coincidence that his father, thirty years before, was", "chosen to fill the vacancy in the Senate caused by the resignation of the", "same individual. L. W. Tazewell took his seat in January, 1825. His", "first efforts in the debates was on the bankrupt bill of that session—", "a searching examination of its details, which annihilated the hopes of its", "friends. His speech, on the 21st of January, in behalf of his motion", "to strike out the third section of the bill for the suppression of piracy", "in the West India seas, which had been reported from the Committee", "of Foreign Affairs, and had been introduced by its chairman, James", "Barbour, was lauded throughout the country. The section proposed to", "be stricken out authorized the President of the United States in time of", "profound peace to declare, on the representations of a naval officer,", "any of the ports of Spain in the West Indies in a state of blockade.", "It was stricken out by the decisive vote of 37 to 10. Had it remained", "in the bill, a war with Spain in all probability would have resulted", "in less than ninety days. On the election of John Quincy Adams to", "the Presidency, Mr. Tazewell became hostile to his administration and", "competency of the executive to originate foreign missions without", "the advice and consent of the Senate, as a constitutional thesis, it", "is claimed, \"stands pre-eminent in our political literature as a model of", "profound research, of thorough argumentation, and of overwhelming", "strength.\" Mr. Tazewell was re-elected to the Senate on the 1st day", "of January, 1829. Whilst in attendance on that body he was elected", "by the Norfolk district a member of the Convention which assembled in", "Richmond, October 5th, 1829, to revise the first Constitution of Virginia.", "In that illustrious body Mr. Tazewell made the opening speech", "in support of a resolution which he offered, and which marked out the", "course of the campaign which he believed to be best adapted to attain", "the general end in view. He engaged with conspicuous ability in the", "important discussions of the convention. His speech on the tenure of", "the judicial office is claimed to have been one of the most able efforts in", "that body of intellectual giants. Mr. Tazewell was also, in 1829,", "tendered the mission to Great Britain, but declined the honor. He", "continued in the Senate until 1833, serving as Chairman of the Committee", "on Foreign Relations, and as President pro tem. of the body during", "a portion of the twenty-second Congress. In January, 1834, he", "was elected Governor of Virginia to succeed John Floyd, and entered", "upon the duties of his office March 31st. He resigned March 31, 1836,", "before the expiration of the term, upon a disagreement with the State", "Legislature. That body had passed resolutions instructing the Senators", "from Virginia to vote for the resolutions to expunge from the journal of", "the Senate the resolutions censuring General Jackson. These instructions", "Governor Tazewell declined to approve. He was succeeded in the office of", "Governor by Lieutenant-Governor Wyndham Robertson. Mr. Tazewell", "was never afterwards in public service. Though so effective with", "juries as an advocate, his style of address is said to have been singularly", "simple and free from artifice. His arguments were conversational and", "his gestures not more striking than those of animated converse. His", "postures were negligent. His voice was pleasant and of ample compass.", "He was never vociferous. His logic was consummate, and in putting", "his arguments before a jury he exhibited great adroitness. He acquainted", "himself with the calling or prejudices of every juryman—and", "When the passions were to be assailed he indulged in a style of fervid", "appeal, which was the more effective as it was rare. Of the person of", "Mr. Tazewell, his friend and eulogist, Hugh Blair Grigsby, LL.D.,", "says: \"As soon as the visitor fixed his eyes on Mr. Tazewell, all else", "was forgotten. He was, without exception, in middle life, the most imposing,", "and in old age, the most venerable person I ever beheld. His", "height exceeded six feet. * * * His head and chest were on a large", "scale, and his vast blue eye, which always seemed to gaze afar, was aptly", "handsome. In middle life he was very thin, though lithe and strong,\"", "but in his latter days he was large of stature, with massive features,", "and hair of silvery whiteness, which fell in ringlets about his neck.", "He died at Norfolk, May 6, 1860. He was the author of a \"Review", "of the Negotiations between the United States and Great Britain respecting", "the Commerce between the Two Countries,\" etc. London, 8vo,", "1829, and which first appeared under the signature \"Sinex,\" in the Norfolk", "Herald,\" in 1827. A portrait of Governor Tazewell is in the State", "Library at Richmond, Virginia. He married, in 1802, Anne Stratton,", "daughter of Colonel John Nivison, of Norfolk, Virginia.", "The family was assumed by the late Hugh Blair Grigsby, LL.D., to be of Norman", "origin, and to deduce from one Tankersville, a knight under William the", "Conqueror, whose name is inscribed on the roll of Battle Abbey. He traces the", "changes in orthography as Tan'sville, Tanswell, and Tazewell. Indeed, the name", "is at this day variously rendered Tanswell, Tarswell, Tassell, Taswell, and Tazewell.", "In the Miscellanea Genealogica et Heraldica (Vol. I, p. 254) the family is traced", "to the year 1588, and the arms given as Vair, purpure and erm on a chief gu.", "a lion passant or Crest—A demi-lion purpure, in the paws a chaplet of roses gu.,", "which, however, differ from those used by John Tazewell and by Governor Littleton", "Waller Tazewell in book-plate and seal-ring respectively. By the former, from", "example in the possession of the writer, they were Ar. or a fesse sa. three crescents", "between three eagles displayed.

By the latter, from an impression of", "the seal-ring furnished by Robert Page Waller, Esq., of Norfolk, Va.; the same, with", "the difference of two instead of three crescents, which may have been a mistake", "The progenitor of the family in England, according to its records, was Alured", "de Waller, who came from Normandy with William the Conqueror, settled in the", "county of Kent, and died A. D. 1183. Richard Waller of this family distinguished", "himself at the battle of Agincourt, where he took prisoner the Duke of Orleans,", "commander-in-chief of the French army, and received from Henry V. of England,", "in honor of his heroic services, a crest of the arms of France hanging by a label from", "an oak, with the motto: Hœc functus virtutis.

Negotiating with Siemens and Fluence", "Xcel Energy is seeking regulatory approval to move forward with seven microgrids, at a cost to the utility of $23.4 million, chosen from a community resilience solicitation that the Colorado utility issued in May.", "The microgrids will serve the Denver International Airport Automated Guideway Transit System; National Western Center; Denver Rescue Mission’s Lawrence Street Community Center; City of Arvada Center for the Arts and Humanities; Town of Nederland Community Center; Summit County Middle School; and Alamosa Family Recreation Center.", "The petition for approval and cost recovery is before the Colorado Public Utilities Commission (Proceeding 19A-0225E).", "The solicitation netted 20 proposals from 13 communities across Xcel’s service territory. In selecting winners, the utility looked for applicants with emergency services that would benefit from microgrids.", "Finalists were scored based on a system that gave 50 points for project feasibility, 20 points for societal benefit and 30 points for grid benefits.", "After choosing the communities, Xcel issued another solicitation in September for the microgrids’ batteries and related technology.", "The solicitation went out to 10 battery system integrators and five microgrid providers. From there, the utility began negotiations with Siemens and Fluence, a joint venture of Siemens and AES.", "Charles Gouin, Xcel Energy business technology consultant, said in the testimony that Xcel selected Siemens and Fluence for negotiatons “based on system performance, a strong track record, and a lower price point.”", "The $23.4 million cost applies to four categories: medium voltage work, battery energy system, systems integration and operations and maintenance, Gouin said.", "Xcel will provide 6 MW/15 MWh of energy storage for the microgrids. The communities will supply solar and back-up generators.", "Some of the communities already have the generating assets, Gouin said, while others will add solar, expanding the renewable energy on the utility’s system.", "The utility sees the projects as a way to learn more about microgrid development and operation after already gaining some experience by building the Panasonic microgrid, which went into operation in 2017.", "Gouin said Xcel incorporated many of the lessons learned from the Panasonic project into the conceptual design work completed to date on the seven microgrids.", "Meet partners and prospects at Microgrid 2020, June 2-3 in Philadelphia.

In 1830, the Granger family moved from Vermont to upstate New York, where after a brief period at an academy Stephen Douglass began to read law under a locally prominent Democratic attorney.", "In 1833, Stephen made his way west to seek his career and fortune. After arriving in Quincy, Illinois, and operating a private school for a time, he secured a law license and set up practice in Jacksonville, Illinois.", "As he established the basis for a professional career, Stephen also changed the spelling of his last name from Douglass to Douglas.", "Stephen A. Douglas first became politically known in Illinois as a staunch Democratic proponent of President Andrew Jackson.", "Between 1835 and 1840, Douglas held a succession of Illinois state offices, some of them concurrently, including state’s attorney, state legislator, register of the Springfield land office, and secretary of state.", "In 1841, at the age of twenty-seven, he was elected to a seat on the Illinois Supreme Court. In 1836, he lost a disputed race for the U.S. House of Representatives by thirty-six popular votes.", "Four years later he lost a campaign for a U.S. Senate seat by five legislative votes. Only in 1843, running in a newly created congressional district, was Douglas able to win a seat in the House.", "As a member of the House of Representatives, Douglas was among those urging an extension of United States territory from the Atlantic to the Pacific.", "He called for the annexation of Texas, the establishment of military posts along the Western emigrant trails, and organization of a Nebraska territorial government.", "By 1845, these and other strong expansionist positions had won Douglas the chairmanship of the House Committee on Territories.", "Through a congressional colleague, Douglas met Martha Denny Martin (1825-1853), the daughter of a wealthy North Carolina planter and a member of a family long prominent in North Carolina political affairs.", "When Stephen and Martha were married in 1847, Robert Martin offered his new son-in-law his 2,500-acre plantation on the Pearl River in Lawrence County, Mississippi.", "Douglas declined the gift, but after Martin died a year later, the Pearl River plantation was bequeathed to Martha and any children she might have.", "Douglas was designated as the property manager and was allocated 20 per cent of the plantation’s annual income for his services.", "Two children born to their marriage survived into adulthood, Robert Martin Douglas (1849-1917) and Stephen Arnold Douglas, Jr. (1850-1908).", "In 1847, after only three years in the House of Representatives, Douglas was elected by the Illinois state legislature to a seat in the U.S. Senate, where he was made chairman of the Senate Committee on Territories.", "His position gave him an influential role in shaping all aspects of national policy affecting western lands, from the courts and post office to military posts and legislative powers.", "He also became quickly immersed in growing sectional disputes over the future of slavery. As a Senator from a state with a mix of strong anti-slavery and pro-slavery sentiment, and as the manager of a Mississippi plantation with more than 100 slaves, Douglas attempted to craft a political position that would avoid favoring either the North or South.", "The first significant test of this policy, the Compromise of 1850, is usually credited to Henry Clay, but it owed a great deal to Douglas' political skills.", "To satisfy the North, California was admitted as a free state, and the slave trade was abolished in the District of Columbia; to reassure the South, the territories of New Mexico and Utah were organized without a prohibition of slavery, and a rigid fugitive slave law was enacted.", "Despite this careful attempt to placate both sides in the slavery controversy, the reaction to the Compromise in the North was immediate and hostile.", "Douglas came under fierce attack in his home state and was able to calm his supporters only by rushing back to Illinois to defend himself before the Chicago city council and the state legislature.", "In 1853, Douglas sustained a grave personal loss when his wife Martha died following complications from the birth of a daughter.", "After their infant girl also died a few weeks later, a grieving Douglas decided to leave the country for an extended tour of Europe.", "His travels took him to London, Constantinople, Moscow, St. Petersburg, and Paris, in the course of which he secured a number of diplomatic audiences and met Czar Nicholas I and Emperor Napoleon III.", "Douglas' personal life did not recover its equilibrium until 1856, when he married twenty-one-year-old Rose Adele Cutts (1835-1899), known as Adele, whose father, James Madison Cutts, was a nephew of President James Madison and Dolley Madison.", "The new Mrs. Douglas accepted Douglas' two sons as her own and raised them with his approval in her own Catholic faith.", "Their infant daughter Ellen died shortly after birth in 1859. The Douglases built an imposing townhouse in Washington just north of Capitol Hill, and it soon became renowned for lavish parties and receptions.", "Douglas' personal affairs also changed in other respects. In 1857, Douglas sold the family plantation on the Pearl River, which had been affected by flooding and poor crops, and in partnership with James A. McHatton of Baton Rouge, moved the agricultural operation to a 2,000-acre property south of Greenville, Mississippi.", "Throughout his career, Douglas maintained a strong interest in science, education, and technological improvements.", "In 1850, Douglas secured the passage of federal legislation supporting the Illinois Central Railroad route from Chicago down the Mississippi Valley to New Orleans, thus helping to make Chicago and Illinois a national center for industry and commerce.", "Douglas was an enthusiastic supporter of the Smithsonian Institution from the time of its founding and in 1854 was appointed a regent of the Smithsonian.", "In 1858 Douglas gave ten acres on the south side of Chicago to serve as the site of the newly organized University of Chicago; the land was part of his Oakenwald estate, where Douglas planned to develop an exclusive suburban neighborhood and erect his own residence.", "Douglas' rising prominence in national affairs reached a crest in January 1854, when he introduced the Kansas-Nebraska bill to organize governments in the Kansas and Nebraska territories.", "In each territory, the question of slavery would be reserved until it entered the Union as a new state; at that time, the voting citizens would draw up a constitution and determine whether or not their state would permit slavery.", "The Kansas-Nebraska bill embodied Douglas' doctrine of popular sovereignty, according to which the voters in newly admitted states, not the federal government, would determine the future of slavery by exercising their democratic rights to self-government.", "Douglas also hoped that popular sovereignty would remove slavery from congressional debate and insulate the federal government from further sectional conflict.", "The Kansas-Nebraska Act, however, unleashed a new torrent of angry protest by Northern anti-slavery forces, who felt it opened the door to an expansion of slavery across the West.", "Douglas returned to Illinois to defend his position, touring the state for two months and twice trading opposing speeches with Abraham Lincoln, a former Whig legislator and congressman who reemerged on the political stage and became a spokesman for the new Republican Party.", "In the wake of the Kansas-Nebraska Act, Douglas also found himself at odds with important elements of the national Democratic party.", "He had first attempted to gain the Democratic nomination for president in 1852. In 1856, he tried once again for the presidential nomination, but withdrew his name in favor of James Buchanan, who went on to win the election.", "The brief alliance between Buchanan and Douglas ended within a year, however, when a pro-slavery convention meeting in Lecompton, Kansas, drew up a constitution proposing statehood and protecting property in slavery.", "Buchanan supported the Lecompton constitution, but Douglas was determined to block it, arguing that its passage was fraudulent and did not express the will of the people in accordance with popular sovereignty.", "Although Douglas could not prevent congressional approval of the constitution, it was later rejected by the voters of Kansas.", "The struggle over Kansas and the spread of slavery became the dominant theme in the Senate election campaign of 1858 in Illinois.", "Douglas was renominated by the Democrats, while Abraham Lincoln was selected as the Republican candidate.", "The campaign between Douglas and Lincoln gained unexpected attention when Lincoln pressed Douglas to agree to join in a series of debates.", "Staged in seven Illinois towns from August to October of 1858, the campaign debates between Douglas and Lincoln drew large crowds and generated detailed press coverage.", "Lincoln charged that Douglas was part of a slavery \"dynasty\" seeking to promote the spread of slavery over the entire nation.", "Douglas argued that Lincoln’s \"House Divided\" speech had pushed the country to the brink of division and that popular sovereignty would resolve the slavery issue.", "On election day, the Republicans won a majority of the popular vote across the state; the Illinois legislature, however, remained in the hands of the Democrats, and Douglas was returned to Washington for another Senate term.", "Douglas and Lincoln were to meet again in the tumultuous presidential election of 1860. Divisions within the Democratic Party had become so deep that when Democrats met first in Charleston and later in Baltimore for their nominating convention, the southern delegates walked out.", "Douglas was able to win the presidential nomination from the remaining northern delegates, but the breakaway Democrats turned to John C. Breckinridge of Kentucky as their candidate.", "The Constitutional Union party nominated John Bell of Tennessee, and the Republicans chose Abraham Lincoln to carry their banner, making the 1860 presidential election a four-way race.", "Douglas was so concerned about the sectional division in the Democratic party and the potential rupture of the federal Union that he decided to break with precedent and campaign on his own behalf, the first presidential candidate in American history to do so.", "Frequently accompanied by Adele, Douglas campaigned through all parts of the country, from New England, New York, and Pennsylvania to Virginia, Tennessee, Alabama, and Georgia.", "His desperate efforts to reunite the Democratic party, however, could not overcome the rapidly disintegrating political situation.", "In November 1860, none of the four presidential candidates secured a majority of the popular vote, but Abraham Lincoln carried the electoral college and won the White House.", "In the months following the presidential election, Douglas returned to Washington to join the efforts to prevent the secession of the southern states, engaging in a series of private meetings with Lincoln to map strategy.", "When the Illinois state legislature went into special session, Douglas traveled to Springfield to make an impassioned speech rallying citizens to a defense of the Union.", "Several weeks later, while staying the Tremont House hotel in Chicago, Douglas fell ill, and his condition soon began to deteriorate.", "On June 3, 1861, with his wife, Adele, at his side, he died.", "The funeral of Stephen A. Douglas was attended by more than 5,000 mourners. His body was laid to rest in a temporary tomb overlooking Lake Michigan, on the Oakenwald property that he had selected for his Chicago residence.", "In 1881, a permanent monument was erected on the site; its designer was Leonard W. Volk, whose wife was a cousin of Douglas and whose education as an artist had been sponsored by Douglas.", "The Civil War had immediate and devastating effects on Douglas family estate.

And this week, the company announced it will be fast-tracking the retirement of its two remaining coal-burning power plants, which are in Minnesota, by 2030.", "So make no mistake: This is industry-shaking news. Here’s our explainer, first published December 5.", "Greater ambition is in Xcel’s political and economic interests", "Xcel has been a leader on clean energy for a while. According to the company, it has reduced its carbon emissions by 35 percent since 2005.", "Earlier in 2018, it announced plans to, by 2030, reduce carbon emissions 60 percent (from 2005 levels), increase the level of renewable energy in its fleet to 55 percent, and shut down 50 percent of its coal capacity — in the state of Colorado.", "Those goals were enough to win the company Utility Dive’s Utility of the Year Award for 2018.", "But the new goals go much farther. And they cover Xcel’s entire eight-state territory.", "So what pushed the company’s ambition so much higher?", "First, renewables are getting really cheap. In its recent solicitations, Xcel has gotten more bids for renewables, with more variety, for much cheaper.", "Wind and solar plants paired with storage are bidding in cheaper than the ongoing operating costs of existing coal plants.", "Renewables are even giving natural gas a run for its money.", "Second, Xcel’s customers — particularly cities — are demanding it. “When your customers are asking for this over and over,” Fowke said when announcing the news, “you really do listen.", "Boulder, the city of Denver, Breckenridge ... Pueblo, they’re considered or they have already decided that they want to pursue 100 percent renewable.”", "Remember that, because it’s important in an age of no federal climate policy: Cities can move utilities, and utilities can move the energy industry.", "Third, the political landscape is shifting. Democrats took the governor’s mansion in Colorado, Michigan, New Mexico, and Wisconsin.", "In Colorado and New Mexico, they now have a “trifecta” — governor and both legislative houses. Running for governor in Colorado, Jared Polis supported a new renewable energy standard of 100 percent by 2040; with Democratic majorities in the state legislature, he might get it passed.", "Renewables are on the rise in the West, popular with politicians, cities, corporations, and ordinary ratepayers.", "It is to Xcel’s benefit to get ahead of the curve and give the people what they want.", "Fourth, Xcel would very much like to build more stuff.", "It is a vertically integrated monopoly. The areas in which it operates have not been “restructured,” i.e., generation has not been split off from transmission and distribution.", "Regulated monopoly utilities, as I’ve explained in previous stories, do not make money on the power they sell or the fuel they buy.", "They make money by drawing a rate of return on investments in power infrastructure. These “rate-based” investments are the utility’s bread and butter.", "In a broad sense, the shift to renewables is good for such utilities. When they shift from existing fossil fuel plants to new renewable energy, they shift from fuel (coal and natural gas) costs, which they make no money on, to investments in new renewable energy power plants, new batteries to store power and electric car chargers to help electrify the vehicle fleet, and tons of new transmission lines, much of which they can rate-base.", "These goals (perhaps combined with a new, more stringent RPS in Colorado) will help Xcel get permission from regulators to depreciate lots of uneconomic old fossil-fuel assets (which activists have been hassling it about anyway) and build, build, build a bunch of new stuff.", "In short, Xcel stands to profit handsomely, and benefit politically, by giving its customers the clean energy they want.", "(Many ratepayer advocates worry that utilities like Duke are taking advantage of this dynamic, using clean energy as an excuse to build stuff that local, distributed energy could handle better — but that’s a different post.)", "A more interesting question is how this might affect Xcel’s monopoly status. On one hand, riding a political wave as a climate champion allows it to stay ahead of grumbling or desire for restructuring.", "On the other hand, Xcel suddenly needing so much clean energy might help grease the skids for regionalization, i.e., the creation of a restructured Western wholesale power market run by a regional transmission operator (RTO).", "If all of the West is heading toward decarbonization together, the region’s utilities will need to pool their resources.", "In fact, they might need to pool their resources rapidly, because the federal tax credits for wind and solar power are set to expire soon.", "Buying a lot of capacity before then could save a lot of money.", "Fifth — and this may be somewhat peripheral, but it’s interesting — on the very same day Xcel made its announcement, the Boulder City Council voted to move forward with creating a municipal utility and breaking off from Xcel.", "Xcel very much opposes that move. By ramping up its clean energy goals, it may not keep Boulder, but it could dissuade other similar-minded cities from following Boulder out the door.", "Anyway, the decision to go carbon-free by 2050 is not a selfless act on Xcel’s part — it sees which way the wind is blowing and is focused on providing returns for shareholders.", "And the announcement leaves many, many details unspecified, including plans to shut down fossil fuel plants and transition plans for affected communities.", "Nonetheless, it shows that incentives are beginning to align in a hopeful way. It is the smart move, politically and economically, for Xcel to set a course for zero carbon.", "That would have been unthinkable 10 or even five years ago.", "A few other aspects of this story are worth highlighting.", "Xcel explicitly did not promise 100 percent renewable electricity. It promised 100 percent carbon-free electricity.", "In this, it echoed California’s recent bill SB 100, which committed the state to 100 percent carbon-free energy by 2045.", "The difference is that carbon-free includes not only renewables but also advanced nuclear power plants and fossil fuel power plants with carbon capture and sequestration, either of which Xcel may end up needing to get to 100.", "The company believes that its 2030 goal can be achieved affordably with renewable energy and other technologies currently available.", "However, achieving the long-term vision of zero-carbon electricity requires technologies that are not cost effective or commercially available today.", "That is why Xcel Energy is committed to ongoing work to develop advanced technologies while putting the necessary policies in place to achieve this transition.", "Both sides of this message are incredibly important and poorly understood by the general public.", "First, we have a really good idea of how to get to 80 percent. Climate researcher Christopher Clack and his team showed in 2016 that the entire US could get to 80 percent using existing commercial technologies.", "We know we can get to 80, but 80 is a long, long way off almost everywhere. There is, in other words, no reason to wait.", "And second, we’re not yet sure how to get that last 20 percent, so we need to keep researching new techniques and technologies in the meantime.", "Xcel is going to work with state regulators to try to do some ratepayer-supported R&D. That seems like a really good idea.", "Targeting zero carbon before we know exactly how to achieve it is the kind of aspirational courage that will very much be needed if the US ever gets anything like a Green New Deal.", "A final side note here: Xcel runs two nuclear plants in Minnesota, which provide almost 30 percent of Xcel power in the Upper Midwest.", "Their licenses will be up around 2030. It’s very likely that to stay on track for its carbon targets, Xcel will need to keep those plants running for longer than that.", "Math like this is what has driven a substantial recent shift in opinion among greens about the wisdom of keeping existing nuclear plants open.", "Somewhat by coincidence, the same day Xcel made its announcement, A.P. Moller-Maersk, the world’s largest shipping container company, announced that it will target carbon neutrality by 2050, though, it said, “carbon neutral vessels must be commercially viable by 2030, and an acceleration in new innovations and adaption of new technology is required.”", "This came on the heels, last month, of Google’s announcement that it would strive to run all its operations on 100 percent clean energy, at all times, around the clock.", "There are now hundreds of companies (Ikea, Apple, BMW, Coca-Cola, Facebook, etc.), more than 90 US cities (Minneapolis, Denver, St. Louis, Atlanta, Salt Lake City, etc.), and two US states (Hawaii and California) committed to reaching 100 percent clean electricity.", "This is how the real target — zero net carbon — will arrive in the US: not in a blinding flash or a big federal bill (at least not at first), but like a virus or a meme, catching hold and spreading through contact.", "Researchers have found that both rooftop solar panels and electric vehicles are contagious. People are more likely to buy them when they see other people buying them.", "Human beings are social creatures, not autonomous utility maximizers. We don’t reason through our purchases and our lifestyles; we generally adopt what’s around us and do what people like us do.", "The very same is true of urban policy makers, corporate officers, utility executives, and state regulators.", "You can show them all the charts and graphs you want — until they see others like them doing these things, they won’t feel confident.", "Now more and more people are doing it, and more and more people are seeing other people doing it. The virus is spreading.", "With Xcel and Platte River Power Authority’s news commitments, the virus has spread into the utility industry."]}
