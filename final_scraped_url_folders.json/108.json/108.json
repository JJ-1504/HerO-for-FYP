unimpeded, this trend will proceed indefinitely.", "Legislators and Regulators Should Be Wary of Establishing Performance Standards without a Foundation of Benchmarking Data", "Colorado’s GHG Roadmap endorses establishing performance standards for buildings, but also argues that requiring building owners to report their properties’ energy-use levels and emissions can help the state identify what sort of standards it should set.", "This current draft legislation, though, would immediately impose mandates for near-term and future energy-use reductions prior to having ever collected any statewide benchmarking data.", "The Roadmap specifically identifies the challenges of setting reduction targets without sufficient data:", "The immediate and persistent impacts of COVID-19 emphasize the critical need to ensure that new mandates don’t impose undue cost burdens.", "Many commercial property owners have endured reduced occupancy due to statewide restrictions upon in-person gathering, and many tenants, as they grow accustomed to increased reliance upon remote work or their businesses suffer privations through the ongoing recession, are also re-evaluating the amounts of office space they will require in the future.", "Since new costs imposed upon building owners are often borne by tenants, owners and tenants alike must be regarded as important stakeholders in these regulatory actions.", "Building Owners Want to Remain Competitive AND to Be Good Stewards of Our Environment", "Of the four sectors identified as major sources of emissions, the other three of which are transportation, utilities, and oil and gas production, the building sector presents a unique challenge for policymakers and regulators with objectives to reduce emissions.", "Regulating just the sale of vehicles with emissions standards, for example, still allows for an overall reduction in emissions within an aggressive timeline since the average lifespan of a vehicle is just 11 years.", "Though the move to reduce emissions from the electric grid will leave large generation assets stranded before the end of their useful lives, utilities are granted the authority to raise rates to cover the costs of new investments they make and to pay off assets no-longer-in-use.", "Buildings, conversely, are fixed assets which do not follow cycles of obsolescence like cars and cannot easily defray the costs of any new investment they undergo as utilities can.", "Where there are cost-effective technologies or behaviors which can reduce a building’s energy use, property owners are strongly incentivized to pursue them.", "Reducing energy costs is good for business; however, rules which force owners to make reductions greater than those the market allows them to make economically harm businesses.", "Sympathetic legislators and the drafters of Colorado’s Roadmap insist that the energy-use reductions they would like buildings to make will save their owners money, but, the way that this draft bill’s performance standards are written, some building operators will have much harder times than others finding solutions which return positive value on investment.", "Each covered building faces a unique path to compliance if the bill passes, and lawmakers should consider it essential to have more complete information to help establish the best path forward.", "Overview of Draft Bill’s Performance Standards and Penalties", "As of March 5th, this bill has not been formally introduced, so its provisions are subject potentially to change.", "Under its current letter, an owner of a covered building is required to report to the state his/her properties’ energy use, energy-use intensity, electricity demand, greenhouse-gas emissions, and Energy Star score.", "This initial requirement of the draft bill is similar to current requirements in Denver, Boulder and Ft. Collins, and does not pose significant compliance costs.", "This draft bill departs from existing benchmarking programs in the state by imposing specific performance standards, or, energy reduction mandates.", "The five conditions of compliance with these standards, as well as the legislation’s special cases and exemptions, are summarized in the table below:", "Covered buildings not exempted and out of compliance with these or the reporting standards are subject to monetary penalties.", "Every building required to report is also charged a small annual fee regardless of performance.

One wrote that “COVID has hit our building hard.", "We are focused on lowering [operating expenses] and leasing up our vacancies. We do not have the capital to support this type of mandate.”", "The other wrote that compliance would be possible, but that it “would cost a substantial amount to get going and complete the projects, buildings not in current position to do, especially with unknown of future tenants [sic].”", "Using Energy Star Scores as Performance Requirements Creates an Inconsistent Standard Over Time", "The foremost performance standards detailed in the draft bill are to be measured in Energy Star scores—Energy Star is a national program which ranks and scores America’s large buildings by their energy-efficiency percentiles within their peer groups.[v]", "Though requiring a minimum score of Colorado’s buildings would meaningfully recognize the achievements of those buildings which already operate to high standards of energy-efficiency, and most respondents to the CSI/CREA/Building Jobs 4 Colorado survey indicated that attaining the draft bill’s Energy Star 75 minimum is the easiest path to compliance, it is practically impossible for all large buildings in the state to maintain high scores.", "Because buildings, especially new ones, are tending to become more energy efficient as technology advances, high Energy Star scores are becoming increasingly difficult to maintain.", "This specific change to Energy Star scores will occur sometime this year as updates are made based on 2019 national building survey results, rather than 2012 survey results.", "A building with a compliant score in one period may reasonably operate to the same standard of energy-efficiency in the next and still fall out of favor because of the relative ease newer buildings have of operating cleanly.", "In this regard, an Energy Star score requirement especially burdens older buildings which already would be more difficult, and will become even more difficult still over the next several years, to coax into compliance.", "As one survey respondent commented, “it will become more difficult to maintain [a compliant score] as the Energy Star standards become more stringent over time and may become costly enough to move the ROI negatively.”", "Another noted that “We could continue to hit [Energy Star scores in the] 80's with changing nothing, but if they continue to make Energy Star harder, we'll have put a lot of dollars in which is not feasible [sic].”", "Furthermore, other states are also seeking to make their buildings more efficient; since Energy Star ratings are distributed on the basis of a national percentile, how can some buildings possibly comply, especially in the long run?", "2. Commercial Building Electrification Poses Significant Costs and Limited Emissions Benefits in the Near Term", "Though its prospects improve as years progress after 2030, forced building electrification at present would impose significant equipment and operational costs upon businesses and public utilities yet would not significantly reduce greenhouse-gas emissions.", "Efforts to Force Electrification Too Quickly Will Not Immediately Reduce Emissions", "The draft benchmarking and performance standard bill does not prescribe any manner by which the buildings it concerns must reduce their energy intensity, but since electric equipment, particularly electric heat pumps, can be less energy-intensive, some building owners may see electrification (the transfer of a building’s power generation from on-site fossil-fuel equipment to an off-site electric utility) as an option for pursuing compliance.", "The Colorado GHG Pollution Reduction Roadmap stresses that building electrification will be a persistent object of state policy, too; according to the Roadmap, “very high levels of electrification [will be] needed to achieve the 2050 [emissions] goals.”", "Building electrification is already becoming more popular as technology advances and electric grids become cleaner, but the Roadmap's recommendations are designed to accelerate the trend in pursuit of the state’s long-term reduction goals.", "If building owners are artificially encouraged to electrify their properties before the technology exists to make it holistically desirable, they may install equipment before their existing equipment ends their life cycles or which will swiftly become outdated as innovation progresses.", "In 2019, emissions generated by electric utilities produced between 263% and 303% more emissions per equivalent unit of energy than each of the three building sectors (residential, commercial, and industrial).[vi]", "Those numbers shrink to 0% and turn negative after 2030 given the policy scenarios in the Roadmap, but the differences are not very big for several more years.", "Full electrification can reduce emissions by 29.6%, 50.9%, and 35.6% in the residential, commercial, and industrial building sectors, respectively, by 2040, under Roadmap policy projections.", "The true cost of achieving that is unclear, however, and if Colorado’s built environment were to fully-electrify sooner, in 2021, the state’s total emissions would be about 39 MMT CO2e—almost 35%—higher than they’re expected to be otherwise (the actual effect would be somewhat less severe than that, since electric equipment is more end-use energy-efficient than fossil-fuel equipment).", "Accelerating electrification to that degree would be disastrous to the pursuit of Colorado’s economy-wide emissions targets.", "In the Short Term, Colorado’s Electrical Grid Can Not Handle a Rapid Influx of Electricity Demand without Causing Rates to Increase Dramatically", "Though a similar report does not exist regarding the conversion of commercial buildings, recent analysis by Xcel Energy, Colorado’s largest electric utility, shows the full electrification of the residential sector would cost $7,000 per home today—over 9% of the state’s median household income.", "That cost drops significantly through next decade to a projected $2,500 per home by 2030.[vii]", "This high short-term cost of swift electrification would result from the extensive upgrades and expansions that the electric grid would have to undergo in order to support it.", "Electrification moves peak electricity demand from summer to winter, which would force utilities to either overhaul their operations or endure regular blackouts.", "According to the same report by Xcel, \"with aggressive electrification, the electric system could shift to a winter peak in the 2030s, possibly earlier, and even before then, the electric system could require more than 4,000 megawatts of new capacity to cover the increased demand—more than a 50% increase in the system’s capacity.\"", "The investment required to equip the grid to handle all the new demand would, naturally, cause customers’ electric rates to skyrocket.", "If residential electrification becomes mandatory for new builds, Xcel Energy's natural gas customers would pay $66 (about 6%) more for the service, annually, by 2030.", "If electrification is mandated for all, including existing, residences, those same annual prices would increase by $930vii—almost 88%.", "Though additional research by Xcel has not been publicized, it follows that large-scale electrification of new and existing commercial buildings would increase these costs as well.", "This would be very burdensome to the people of Colorado, especially those most-harmed by the ongoing recession.", "Electric Retrofitting May Not Be Feasible, or May Be Too Costly, for Some Buildings", "Building electrification will become easier and less expensive over time, but, for now, it remains prohibitively expensive for some buildings and completely impossible for others.", "Some building uses are technologically easier to electrify than others (the requisite technology for agricultural and industrial electrification is many years off, for example), and cold-weather electric heating technology is still relatively infantile.", "According to Xcel, “the value proposition of electrifying...improves starting in the mid-2020s as commercially available electric technologies for space and water heating and other appliances become more efficient and as Xcel Energy’s electric system becomes less carbon intensive.\"", "Existing technology is not wholly sufficient to ensure the enduring efficacy of high-tech electrical equipment, so forced electrification imposes a high risk of equipment obsolescence upon compliant buildings.", "Operators unaccustomed to electric systems, additionally, will have to undergo potentially years of re-training in order to learn how to operate them efficiently.", "If building owners are artificially encouraged to electrify their properties before the technology exists to make it holistically desirable, they may install equipment which will swiftly become less initially expensive as innovation progresses.", "3. The Timing of the Draft Bill’s Performance Standards Is Dubious and the Administrative Costs are Unknown", "Buildings are getting cleaner, innovation is advancing, and the economical appeal of electrification is growing already—how large a sum is worth paying to accelerate those trends, and is now the right time to try?", "The Costs to the State and to Taxpayers of Such an Ambitious Program are Unclear", "The launching and continuity of the draft bill’s benchmarking and reporting program depend upon several daunting responsibilities that Colorado’s government stands to undertake.", "The state will be responsible for collecting and synthesizing an immense amount of data about Colorado’s built environment, creating and maintaining the reporting channels for buildings, interpreting countless reams of submitted data, enforcing compliance, auditing troublemakers, drafting new performance rules, and issuing and collecting fines for noncompliance; these together will require extensive labor and administration which taxpayers will have to fund.", "Energize Denver, a benchmarking program limited to Denver’s city limits and which does not enforce performance standards, cost $1.3m of public money in 2020;[viii] a statewide requirement which includes performance standards stands to cost much more than this.", "It is important that regulators understand and consider the costs as they decide whether and how to implement legislation.", "No fiscal cost estimate of the draft bill has yet been developed, and legislators should be wary of saddling taxpayers with indefinite costs.", "Building Benchmarking Alone Could Be Beneficial to the State Government and the Private Sector Before Regulators Set Performance Standards", "Because of the uncertainty of the costs of draft-bill compliance and the potentially-awkward timing of reduction mandates considering the short-term outlooks for electrification and demand-side management, a reasonable approach may be to gather information now through benchmarking, without the pressure of enforceable requirements, and delay imposing performance standards until the government understands Colorado’s building stock better and the electrical grid has had enough time to support an aggressive shift to electrification.", "A reporting requirement alone, in addition to providing regulators valuable information, can effectively heighten the environmental performances of buildings by forcing operators to gain thorough understandings of their buildings’ energy-use intensities and, thus, highlighting some ways by which they might reduce costly waste.", "In Denver, since the launch of Energize Denver’s benchmarking requirement, all building types except municipal and distribution (already the lowest-intensity category) have reduced their average energy-use intensity readings[ix]—owners who can definitively identify areas of opportunity for energy savings are easily motivated to act upon them.", "Without comprehensive data collected through reporting or some other means, understanding the aggregate economic impacts and net costs of this draft benchmarking bill is impossible—if businesses and ordinary taxpayers are to trust that such a program as this will not affect devastating unintended consequences upon some actors within the private sector, much more information ought to be presented.", "Once enough is understood about Colorado’s building sectors to begin developing reasonable performance standards, the guiding regulatory effort should be to prioritize targeting promising and cost-effective reductions and to avoid unintentionally penalizing buildings for outcomes out of their owners’ controls or the successes of others.", "Under the auspices of a prudent approach, buildings in Colorado can reduce their environmental impacts without overspending, and some may even benefit financially from it.", "A Survey of Commercial Building Owners and Operators Highlights Many of the Key Outstanding Questions and Concerns About How Mandates Will Impact their Businesses", "During the week of February 22th through February 26th, in coordination with Colorado Real Estate Alliance (CREA) and Building Jobs 4 Colorado, CSI conducted a survey to collect responses from large commercial building owners to better inform the understanding of potential impacts related to establishing emission and energy reduction mandates for covered properties.", "Energy-efficiency and emissions reductions are front-of-mind goals for any responsible building owner, both as good business decisions and as actions of responsible environmental stewardship.", "Though an effort to enforce the pursuit of these goals seems well-intentioned, closer evaluation finds that it can cause unpredictable and often devastating impacts.", "As there lacks much publicly available aggregate data about these issues, this survey was intended to gather that sort of information in a localized and qualitative, but hopefully informative, manner.", "The results displayed of questions 1 through 8 capture all survey respondents, and the featured responses to questions 9 through 11 were selected for completeness and insight from their respective pools of 108.", "All comments directly from survey respondents are presented unedited.", "[i] https://energyoffice.colorado.gov/climate-energy/ghg-pollution-reduction-roadmap", "[ii] Emissions data from Colorado’s GHG Inventory and E3;

Several of the programs have had to loosen restrictions, increase individual project size limits, and expand the overall size of the program.", "New programs would do well to build these changes into their programs from the beginning.", "To date, Minnesota has seen the most success with community solar. Massachusetts and Minnesota had close to the same installed capacity in quarter three of 2017, 114 MW and 116 MW respectively, but the Massachusetts program has not been able to achieve the same rate of growth as Minnesota.", "This is, again, because the Minnesota program has no caps and secures an economical payout for installations.", "Colorado and Minnesota are served by the same utility company. Xcel in Colorado (the Public Service Company of Colorado), however, has maintained severe program caps on Solar Rewards Community Gardens.", "The Colorado Public Utilities Commission has approved each program cap in a series of expansions. Despite the Colorado state legislation passing one of the first community solar bills in 2010, the program has struggled to grow within its confines.", "Hawaii, Illinois, and Maryland all have budding community solar programs, but have yet to see many interconnected projects.", "- Hawaii, by an April 2020 Public Utilities Commission order, has begun phase two of its community solar program.", "In this phase, more program capacity has been allotted and the program will now include additional technologies and community solar gardens specifically for low-to-moderate income subscribers.", "- Illinois has allotted much of the Illinois Solar for All program capacity, and many projects had their applications approved, but few have completed construction.", "- Maryland’s community solar pilot program commenced in 2017.

On the one hand, originators play an important role in developing new and improved medicines for the benefit of society.", "On the other hand, generic companies benefit society by supplying cheaper equivalents of the originators’ medicines, which leads to the reduction of drug prices and facilitates access to affordable medicines.", "When the interests of these two players are kept in balance, benefits are maximised for society, which receives innovative and improved medicines, as well as timely access to generic drugs.", "However, if the balance swings towards one of the players, then society loses out, as there will be insufficient access to either innovative or affordable medicines.", "Therefore, both pharmaceutical innovation and generic competition must be duly incentivised and protected.", "Moreover, these two elements of the pharmaceutical industry are constantly interacting and have a profound impact on each other.", "In particular, pharmaceutical innovation is the backbone of the pharmaceutical industry, in which originators play an important role.", "The process of drug development is long and complicated, requires significant investments, and bears considerable commercial risks.17 It is also highly regulated, including, among other things, the requirement for originators to obtain a special authorisation from a designated state authority to market a drug.", "Such marketing authorisations are granted to the originators only if they can prove that the drug is safe and effective, which typically requires lengthy and expensive clinical trials.18", "In order to protect these significant efforts and investments, pharmaceutical companies rely heavily on the exclusivity granted by intellectual property rights, and in particular, patents.19 Patents provide a 20-year monopoly right, during which a pharmaceutical company enjoys market exclusivity and can charge a monopoly price for its products.", "Originators argue that strong patent protection is essential in order to recoup investments, as well as to incentivise them to engage in further innovation.20 Once such patent protection expires, however, other companies may develop generics of a branded drug, and start competing with the originator for the market.", "This is called generic competition. Generic drugs are bioequivalent versions of a branded drug that has lost its patent protection.21 It is estimated that the generic entry typically leads to, on average, an 80 per cent market share loss and a 20–30 per cent reduction of a drug price, with further price decreases with each additional generic entrant, leading, in some instances, to a fall in price of up to 90 per cent.22 A representative example of the effect of generic competition on the originators’ drug prices is the significant decrease in price and dramatic loss of profits by Eli Lilly.", "The expiration of a patent protecting its blockbuster23 antidepressant Prozac in 2001 resulted in a loss of almost 70 per cent of its market and $2.4 billion in annual U.S. sales.24 This effect of generic competition is beneficial for society, as it reduces the financial pressure on healthcare budgets and increases the accessibility of drugs.", "As was mentioned above, generic competition is prevented during the life of a patent protecting an active compound of a drug (a so-called “basic” or “primary” patent).25 Such a basic patent covers an active ingredient itself and, therefore, provides the strongest protection for the product.", "Therefore, generic competition normally starts only after the basic patent expires, or if a generic company succeeds in invalidating it.", "While in the past pharmaceutical companies mainly protected their products with a single patent covering an active compound,26 they now increasingly seek additional patent protection on various aspects of a drug27 in order to protect their market position.28 Such additional patents are often called secondary patents.29", "A pharmaceutical company may want to obtain secondary patents, which protect such aspects of a drug as, for example, its process of manufacture, formulation and/or specific form, etc.", "Therefore, even after the basic patent protecting an active compound expires, a drug may still be protected by other secondary patents.", "This may result in the extension of the scope and length of the protection of a product, especially if secondary patents have a later expiration date than a basic patent.30 This, in particular, may occur if, for example, the process of producing an active compound disclosed in the basic patent is sufficient only for reproducing this compound in a laboratory, but it is unsuitable for producing it on a large commercial scale.31 If the originator was able to secure a secondary patent that protects such a large scale manufacturing process, it would prevent generics from using this process for producing their generic versions of a drug; otherwise they would risk infringing this secondary patent.32 However, a unique feature of pharmaceuticals is that an active ingredient can be manufactured using different methods and processes, can exist in different forms or can be used in different formulations.", "Therefore, when a basic patent on an active ingredient expires, other companies can develop alternative methods of production, forms or formulations of this active compound and start competing with the originator company.33 While such patenting strategies by originators are lawful in principle, some of them may be problematic.", "In particular, in anticipation of the loss of patent protection, originators may engage in strategic patenting which artificially prevents generic competition and results in an extension of their market monopoly.34", "In its Sector Inquiry Report, the European Commission explained that the drug development process consists of three main stages: (i) the R&D stage, which ends with the launch of a drug on the market; (ii) the period between the launch and the patent expiry; and (iii) the period after the patent expiration, when generics can enter the market.35 During the second stage, i.e. after the launch of a drug, originators seek to maximise their income from the product in order to recoup their R&D investments and earn profits before the commencement of generic competition.36 It is also during this stage that pharmaceutical companies seek to prolong their market exclusivity.", "In recent years, pharmaceutical companies have been increasingly relying on the strategic use of the patent system to combat the pressure of generic competition.", "Such practices are often called “life cycle management” by originators and proponents of the practice.", "For example, as Burdon and Sloper explained, “[a] key element of any life cycle management strategy … is to extend patent protection beyond the basic patent term for as long as possible, by filing secondary patents which are effective to keep generics off the market”.37", "However, critics have characterised the practice as “evergreening”,38 as it essentially evergreens the patent protection and the exclusivity of a product.39 For instance, Bansal et al.", "explain that evergreening “refers to different ways wherein patent owners take undue advantage of the law and associated regulatory processes to extend their IP monopoly, particularly over highly lucrative ‘blockbuster’ drugs, by filing disguised/artful patents on an already patent-protected invention shortly before expiry of the ‘parent’ patent”.40", "During its investigation into the pharmaceutical industry, the European Commission found that the number of patents granted and pending applications significantly increases with the value of a drug, i.e. “blockbuster medicines can even be protected by up to nearly 100 INN41-specific EPO patented bundles and applications …, which in one particular case led to 1,300 patents and applications across all the EU Member States”.42 The Commission also found that the ratio of primary to secondary patents is 1:7, where the latter “mostly concern formulations, processes and non-formulation products…, such as salts, polymorphic forms, particles, solvates and hydrates”.43 As a result, the Commission concluded that the practice of “maximising patent coverage in such a way is the creation of a web of patents”, which affects the generics’ ability to “develop a generic version of the medicine in form of a salt, crystalline or amorphous form”, because it “would inevitably infringe a patent (for example, a patent for the relevant salt, crystalline or amorphous form of the medicine)”.44 Each of such patents would typically have a later expiration date, which effectively extends a period of market exclusivity beyond the expiration of a basic patent.45 In addition, most of these patents that protect such follow-on modifications are so-called “sleeping” patents, i.e. patents which a company has no intention of commercialising.46 Moreover, such modifications may provide little or no therapeutic benefits to the patient compared to the original drug.47 Nevertheless, such patents allow originators to secure the most efficient, broadest and longest possible protection for their successful products.48", "The denser the web of secondary patents, the more difficult it is for generics to develop their generic equivalents, even if they know that only a few patents of a large portfolio would, in fact, be valid and infringed by their products.49 Despite such knowledge, it is impossible to be certain before introducing a generic whether this will be the case and, thus, whether the generic company will be subject to injunctions preventing the sale of their generic products.50 Such practice, therefore, provides an appreciable competitive advantage for originators by creating a significant legal and commercial uncertainty for generics in relation to the possibility of their market entry.51", "This paper argues that such a strategic use of the patent system by pharmaceutical companies is against the shared goal of patent and competition laws of facilitating innovation for the benefit of society.", "As will be explained further, in addition to a more immediate negative effect in the form of high drug prices, strategic patenting may also impair innovation by reducing originators’ incentives to innovate, and affecting generics’ ability to develop alternative generic products.", "Strategic patenting, therefore, may enable originators to avoid competitive pressures by preventing generic competition without a need to engage in genuine innovation.", "Strategic Patenting Contradicts the Rationale of the Patent System and Competition Law", "In the competitive markets, the success of a company is based on its business performance.52 In order to compete on performance by “offering better quality and a wider choice of new and improved goods and services”53 firms must innovate.", "Realising the importance of protecting innovation, which is considered to be the main driver of economic growth,54 states have put in place various mechanisms to ensure a suitable environment for its advancement.", "These include granting the property rights to the results of innovation in the form of patents, as well as implementing competition law rules to stimulate dynamic competition.55", "Specifically, one of the main justifications for the patent system is the encouragement of innovation56 that serves as an engine for economic growth and development.57 The patent system pursues this aim by offering the patent owners a period of exclusive rights as a reward for their innovative efforts and an incentive to engage in further innovation.58 Therefore, intellectual property rules, and patents in particular, are seen as an essential element of undistorted competition on the internal market.59 These exclusive rights are considered to be a necessary incentive to invest in R&D and innovation, particularly in such sectors as pharmaceuticals, where the R&D costs are high, but the costs of copying the R&D results are marginal.60 At the same time, the “innovation theory”, embodied in the EU competition law rules and policy, is designed to stimulate innovation by fostering competition on the markets.61 The competition law rules keep markets innovative by maintaining effective competition through preventing the foreclosure of markets and maintaining access to them.62 The rationale is that firms react to pressures of competition by continuously seeking to innovate.63 Therefore, patent and competition laws complement each other, as on the one hand, existing competition creates pressures on firms, forcing them to innovate, the so-called “stick”, while on the other hand, patent law provides a “carrot” in the form of the exclusive right, thus inducing innovators to innovate.64 These two bodies of laws are seen as “complementary efforts to promote an efficient marketplace and long-run, dynamic competition through innovation”.65", "As the European Commission noted “both intellectual property rights and competition are necessary to promote innovation and ensure a competitive exploitation thereof”.66 These two bodies of laws, therefore, have the same fundamental goal of enhancing innovation for the benefit of consumer welfare.", "Importantly, patent and competition laws are designed to stimulate not only innovation of “pioneer” innovators, but they are also aimed at facilitating follow-on innovation.67 Patent law contains provisions that require inventors to disclose information about their inventions, as well as providing exceptions such as experimental use and compulsory licensing, which allow third parties to access the inventions still under patent protection.68 Therefore, along with pioneer innovators, the rationale of incentives to innovate in patent law also applies to follow-on innovators, balancing the interests of these two types of inventors.69 Similarly, competition law aims at stimulating all types of innovation, including follow-on innovation.", "On the other hand, EU competition law proscribes practices that reduce incentives to innovate both for “pioneer” and follow-on innovators.", "This is enshrined in Art. 102(b) TFEU, which prohibits abuses that consist of, inter alia, limiting technological development.", "For example, in AstraZeneca the General Court considered that the company’s practice of misusing the patent system had the potential of reducing its incentives to innovate and was anticompetitive.70 In Magill71 and Microsoft,72 the courts found that the IP rights owners abused their dominant positions by blocking innovation of their potential competitors.", "More recently, several decisions by the European Commission also emphasised the importance of protecting innovation.", "In January 2018, the Commission fined Qualcomm73 €997 million for abusing its market dominance in LTE74 baseband chipsets.75", "The Commission considered that the exclusivity payments that Qualcomm paid to Apple denied rivals the possibility to compete on the merits, and deprived European consumers of genuine choice and innovation.76", "Furthermore, in July 2018, the Commission found in Google Android that Google abused its dominant position, and fined the company €4.34 billion for anticompetitive restrictions it had imposed on mobile device manufacturers and network operators to strengthen its dominant position in general internet search.77 The Commission considered that Google’s restrictive practices denied other companies the chance to compete on the merits and innovate.78 Finally, in 2017 the Commission issued its decision, in which it took the view that Amazon abused its dominant positions on the markets for the retail distribution of e-books by inserting the so-called “parity clauses” in the agreements with its e-book suppliers.79 It concluded that these clauses had the potential of reducing the incentives to innovate both by e-book suppliers and retailers.80", "These decisions demonstrate that the European Commission recognises the fundamental importance of protecting innovation.", "They confirm that strategies that are capable of stifling innovation and reducing the incentives to innovate may constitute an abuse of dominance under Art.", "102 TFEU. It is argued in this article that, along with the practices condemned by the Commission in the decisions discussed above, strategic patenting can also harm innovation by impairing incentives to innovate of both originators and generic companies, and therefore should raise competition law concerns.", "Strategic Patenting Impairs Originators’ Incentives to Innovate", "While originator companies typically argue that the competition law intervention into their patenting practices will reduce their incentives to innovate,81 this article asserts that strategic patenting itself reduces originators’ incentives.", "Thus, in a properly functioning system, when a patent protecting a product is close to expiration the originator would be encouraged to innovate further in order to introduce a new product on the market and maintain its competitive position.", "However, by engaging in strategic patenting, the originator’s incentive to innovate diminishes as it enjoys its monopoly position by merely procuring numerous secondary patents that shield its current product from generic competition.", "Therefore, when companies engage in such strategic patenting, they are merely protecting themselves from the competitive pressures that competition law aims to establish.", "Maintaining that this practice is lawful, originators argue that strong patent protection is essential for recouping their investments, as well as for incentivising them to engage in further innovation.82 Such a position may find some support in the arguments put forward by Joseph Schumpeter and his followers, who claimed that since monopoly increases the reward of the innovator, monopolists are more prone to innovation.83 However, as Lowe noted:84", "the empirical evidence of the past few decades has worked against Schumpeter and in favor of Kenneth Arrow, who contends that in favoring monopolies Schumpeter underestimated the incentives for innovation that competition can offer.", "Monopolists tend to want to keep their monopolies by resorting to any measures that can keep new entrants out.", "Firms under competitive pressure from actual or potential competition, on the other hand, are less complacent and know that inventing a new product is their best strategy for maintaining and increasing their market share.", "In the same vein, the Commission emphasises the importance of competition for the incentives to innovate, stating that: “[r]ivalry between undertakings is an essential driver of economic efficiency, including dynamic efficiencies in the form of innovation.", "In its absence the dominant undertaking will lack adequate incentives to continue to create and pass on efficiency gains.", "Evidence from the pharmaceutical industry confirms that strategic patenting reduces incentives to engage in genuine and meritorious innovation.", "In many cases, strategically accumulated secondary patents are of marginal quality and are typically the result of routine research activities.86 For example, in Perindopril the European Commission revealed that most of the secondary patents, procured as part of the originator company’s anti-generic strategy, were seen by the company as “blocking” or “paper”, some of which it considered involved “zero inventive step”87 and a purely editorial task.88 Moreover, these follow-on pharmaceutical inventions are specifically timed around the expiration of the basic patent and can be developed on demand.89 In AstraZeneca the Commission noted that the company designed to “[f]ile a patent-cloud of mixtures, uses, formulations, new indications, and chemistry” in relation to its blockbuster product omeprazole to slow down generic entry at a specifically defined time, close to the expiration of the basic patent.90 The main aim of these patents is to increase uncertainty for generic companies as to the possibility of their market entry.91 Therefore, while many of these secondary patents may be trivial and potentially invalid, the originator pursues them to protect its current successful product from generic competition.92", "Even if a company continues to engage in innovation in parallel to pursuing strategic patenting, it still protects itself from the pressures of competition, which would have forced the company to innovate faster and would thus provide consumers with better products and/or access to cheaper generic versions earlier.", "A slowdown in the transition of the new medicines from the protected status of a proprietary medicine to the status of generic products manufactured and distributed in open competition does not simply mean a loss of static efficiency, namely a loss of consumer well-being due to a slowdown in the reduction of process.", "Rather, such a slowdown also involves the risk of a loss of dynamic efficiency in that it extends the duration of a monopoly rent situation, thus reducing the pressure to innovate more quickly.", "Following the rationale of the General Court’s statement in AstraZeneca, the practice of the originator that extends its market monopoly by relying on the patent system “potentially reduces the incentive to engage in innovation, since it enables the company in a dominant position to maintain its exclusivity beyond the period envisaged by the legislator”.94 Such practices, according to the Court, act “contrary to the public interest”.95", "Therefore, the practice of strategic patenting that protects originators’ monopolies from competitive pressures and significantly reduces their incentives to engage in genuine innovation is contrary to the rationale of the patent system, has a significant negative effect on competition and should raise competition law concerns.", "Strategic Patenting Impairs Follow-on Innovation of Generic Companies", "Strategic patenting also has a chilling effect on follow-on innovation by generic competitors in the form of developing alternative versions of an off-patent compound.", "As was discussed earlier, the expiry of a basic patent that protects an active compound facilitates generic competition.", "This is because even if the product is still protected by process, specific form or formulation patents, generic companies may develop alternative ways of producing or formulating the product and start competing with the originator.", "In the absence of strategically accumulated patents by the originator, generic companies are typically open to innovating to launch alternative generic products as soon as the basic patent expires.", "However, by pursuing strategic patenting, originators may discourage generics from engaging in follow-on innovation because of the uncertainty about the patent protection and a fear of infringing on one of the numerous patents.96 In its Sector Inquiry Report, the Commission cited the following quote from one of the originators:", "The entire point of the patenting strategy adopted by many originators is to remove legal certainty. The strategy is to file as many patents as possible on all areas of the drug and create a “minefield” for the generics to navigate.", "All generics know that very few patents in that larger group will be valid and infringed by the product they propose to make, but it is impossible to be certain prior to launch that your product will not infringe and you will not be the subject of an interim injunction.97", "Therefore, as a result of creating an impenetrable ring of patent protection by the originator,98 generic competitors may be prevented from developing alternative generic versions of an off-patent compound.", "One of the examples revealed by the Commission during its Pharmaceutical Sector Inquiry was the filing by an originator company of “more than 30 patent families translating into several hundreds of patents in the Member States in relation to one product”, many of which were filed after the introduction of the product.99 This affected the intentions of several generic companies that planned to develop and bring their generic versions of the original product to the market.100", "As a result, in addition to the already high barriers to entry into the pharmaceutical market due to patents that protect an existing product and the need to obtain a marketing authorisation, strategic patenting raises these entry barriers further, making it very difficult for generic companies to overcome them.", "This strategy, therefore, “may without further enforcement action by originator companies, … delay generic entry until the patent situation is clearer or even discourage more risk-sensitive generic companies from entering altogether”.101 Consequently, the fact that actual or potential competitors of originators would not be able to develop alternative generic products means that no one could enter the market and challenge originators’ monopoly positions.", "This results in a weakening of competition in the relevant market and a strengthening of the originator’s already dominant position.", "As Maggiolino put it, “patent accumulation … may work as a pre-emptive entry-deterrence strategy to protect monopoly power and … lower consumer welfare by allowing dominant firms to keep on charging over-competitive prices”.102 Therefore, when an array of accumulated secondary patents “blocks monopolists’ rivals from producing follow-on innovations, this strategy prevents the whole society from enjoying … these further innovations”.103 While practices that facilitate innovation are encouraged by competition law, practices that are aimed at blocking follow-on innovation by competitors should raise competition law concerns.", "Strategic Patenting is Considered Lawful Under the Current Approach", "As could be seen from the above discussion, strategic patenting acts against the rationale of the patent system and competition law as it impairs innovation, enabling pharmaceutical companies to block generic competition, which leads to high drug prices.", "However, in the EU, the courts have never applied the competition law rules to condemn the procurement of internally developed patents.104", "This approach in the EU takes its origins from the “existence-exercise” doctrine.105 As the General Court explained, while the EU Treaties “never expressly provided for a reconciliation between intellectual property rights and competition law”, they", "nevertheless provided for a reconciliation of intellectual property rights with the principle of free movement of goods, by indicating that the provisions of [Article 36 TFEU] relating to the prohibition of quantitative restrictions between Member States were not to preclude restrictions on imports, exports or goods in transit justified, inter alia, on grounds of the protection of industrial and commercial property.106", "intended to draw a distinction between the existence of a right conferred by the legislation of a Member State in regard to the protection of artistic and intellectual property, which cannot be affected by the provisions of the Treaty, and the exercise of such right, which might constitute a disguised restriction on trade between Member States.107", "Therefore, as early as in 1974 it has been recognised that, while the conditions under which intellectual property rights are exercised may fall within the prohibitions contained in Arts.", "101 and 102 TFEU, the existence of such rights is not affected by EU competition law.108", "Following this reasoning, the EU competition case law does not deal with practices related to the existence of IP rights, and instead focuses on their exercise.109", "Specifically, it provides that in order to establish an abuse of dominant position, a mere procurement of patents will not suffice, even if they have a negative effect on the market.110 To prove an abuse, an additional element in the form of unlawful exercise of IP rights, such as misuse of patent procedures,111 vexatious litigation112 or unlawful refusal to license,113 must be demonstrated.", "Recent case law confirms this approach. In Perindopril,114 the Commission investigated an anti-generic strategy of a pharmaceutical company, one of the crucial elements of which was the accumulation of blocking patents with the sole purpose of delaying generic competition.", "While having established that this practice had, in fact, such an effect, the Commission did not pursue it and instead focused on two other practices, namely the acquisition of alternative patents from third parties and reverse payment agreements.", "The Commission noted that a dominant firm “can have a strategy to protect its commercial interests without infringing Article 102 of the Treaty, which may particularly include the strategic use of IPRs and the patent system”.115 As a result, in its decision the Commission clearly distinguished patent strategies, i.e. strategic patenting in the form of accumulation of blocking patents from other practices, such as patent acquisitions and reverse payment agreements.", "The former strategies were seen as lawful, while the latter were considered anticompetitive.", "Supporting the current approach to strategic patenting, some commentators argue that the internal mechanisms of patent law should deal with strategic patenting, and if this practice is in line with its rules and objectives, it must be considered lawful.116 This is justified by the idea that patent law facilitates innovation by granting inventors the right to exclude others from using their invention as a reward for their skills, creative efforts and investments.117", "It is further argued that, from a patent law perspective, it is irrelevant whether the exclusion is based on one or thousands of patents, it is the value of innovation which they protect that matters.118", "Therefore, it is maintained that strong patent protection promotes ex ante incentives to innovate and “patenting around the core invention increases the likelihood that protection will be effective and that the ex ante investment will be recouped”.119 As a result, it cannot be abusive to utilise the patent system to seek an optimal protection of an invention,120 and thus obtain multiple secondary patents around an active ingredient with the purpose of protecting it.", "In these circumstances, they explain, it is patent law and not competition law that must determine the question of a patent grant.121 Once patent law has determined that the invention merits protection, i.e. it meets the patentability criteria, competition law should not second-guess this decision.122", "The proponents of the current approach further reject the Commission’s suggestion, put forward in its Sector Inquiry Report, that the intention to prevent generic competition may be important in determining whether the patenting practice is an abuse.123 It is argued that the intention of a dominant firm to exclude cannot be decisive, because the exclusionary effect is the very essence of a patent, and therefore “innovators that rely on patents to recoup their investments necessarily pursue a strategy of excluding entry”.124 It is considered that as far as competition law is concerned, the “right to exclude” allows the patent owner the right not to compete with himself.125 This would be the case even if it is done by removing competing patents from the market, accumulating them and keeping them dormant, rather than allowing others access to these patents.126 Therefore, since the ability to exclude is explicitly recognised in EU law as forming part of the specific subject matter of a patent, strategic patenting is “neither illegal nor anticompetitive”,127 and is immune from Art.", "102 TFEU intrusion.128 In order to find an abuse, it is argued, there must be a “plus-factor”, such as, for example, fraud on the patent office.129 In line with this argument, other authors argue that this practice alone should not be of concern for competition law unless it is coupled with some additional anticompetitive practice, such as bundling and tying or mandatory package licensing.130", "As a result, under the current approach the procurement of internally developed patents for the purpose of blocking generic competition is considered a lawful practice.", "However, as was discussed above, the patent system is used strategically to artificially block generic competition and prevent a timely arrival of cheaper generic versions.", "This, in turn, allows pharmaceutical companies to charge exorbitantly high prices on drugs, thus harming consumer welfare.", "Moreover, while some contend that the extension of the scope of Art. 102 TFEU application to patenting practices may have a significant negative effect on innovation,131 this article argued earlier that such practices, in fact, may stifle dynamic competition by impairing innovation, enabling dominant companies to strengthen their monopoly power.", "Strategic Patenting Should be Subject to Scrutiny Under Competition Law Rules", "Considering the negative effect on drug prices and innovation, strategic patenting raises a crucial question: should it be shielded from any competition law interventions, or are there any instances where it may attract the attention of competition law?", "As noted above, the traditional approach to strategic patenting essentially prevents any competition law involvement.", "This position is based on several related arguments. It is considered that competition law should intervene only at the stage when IP rights are exercised, and should not concern itself with their mere existence.", "Furthermore, it is argued that strategic patenting is lawful because it is in line with patent law, and that internal patent law mechanisms should control this practice.", "As a result, in the absence of any additional factors, it should fall outside the oversight of competition law.132", "This approach effectively prevents any competition law enforcement actions in relation to strategic patenting.", "However, as will be argued further, competition authorities may rely on the rules and principles of EU competition law to investigate this practice.", "Thus, the first set of arguments against the competition law oversight of strategic patenting is firmly based on the “existence-exercise” dichotomy.", "However, while the traditional approach to strategic patenting considers that a mere procurement of patents cannot violate competition law, the support for a different view may be drawn from the AstraZeneca case.", "Specifically, AstraZeneca relates to the two abuses by the company that consisted of providing misleading information to the patent offices to obtain an extension of its patent rights in the form of supplementary protection certificates (SPCs) (first abuse); and the withdrawal of its marketing authorisation that prevented generics from relying on the data of the original medicine (second abuse).", "When assessing AstraZeneca’s conduct relevant to the first abuse, the courts dismissed the company’s argument that in order to find an abuse an IP right must be exercised, stating that the mere existence of such a right may also restrict competition.133 The General Court noted in this regard that:", "[it] rejects the applicant’s argument that a finding of an abuse of a dominant position requires that an exclusive right obtained as a result of misleading representations has been enforced….", "The mere possession by an undertaking of an exclusive right normally results in keeping competitors away, since public regulations require them to respect that exclusive right.134", "The Court concluded that should it be otherwise it would tend to make the application of Art. 102 TFEU conditional on the infringements by competitors of a dominant firm’s IP rights.135 This finding is significant, since it essentially allows the Commission to overcome the “existence-exercise” doctrine, and, thus, may permit the enforcement activities in this practice.136", "As to the second set of arguments against the involvement of competition law in strategic patenting, as discussed above, some authors argue that this practice is lawful because it is in line with patent law, and that the internal patent law mechanisms should control this practice, rather than the external rules of competition law.", "Such arguments, while sound, should not stop competition authorities from investigating strategic patenting.", "First, the current patent system in Europe allows and, in fact, encourages originators to procure secondary patents due to its low patentability standards.", "While many such patents may be sleeping patents, which bring no therapeutic benefit over existing medicines, they may be strategically used by pharmaceutical companies to prevent generic competition.", "Despite this, the patent system is not able to address this problem, as it does not control the intention of the patentee, contains no requirement to use the patent, and does not oblige the patentee to prove that its follow-on invention is better for the patient than the existing product (i.e. it merely requires that the invention is new and non-obvious, not superior).", "While one of the options could be to strengthen these patentability standards, which may reduce the number of secondary patents, this may not entirely solve the problem.", "This is because pharmaceutical companies may still be able to obtain patents on follow-on pharmaceutical inventions if they meet these patentability requirements.", "Moreover, it is unlikely that the jurisdictions with low patentability standards will raise the bar, because this would be against their policy objectives for setting the bar low in the first place in order to encourage pharmaceutical innovation.", "Finally, strengthening the inventive step requirement may potentially have an adverse effect, since in some cases pharmaceutical companies may choose to rely on trade secrets instead, which would result in many inventions remaining undisclosed.", "This article, therefore, submits that while the patent system is not adequately equipped to address the problem of strategic patenting, competition law may be a more suitable tool to deal with this practice.", "Second, as to the lawfulness of this practice under patent law, it has long been recognised in EU competition law that “the illegality of abusive conduct under Article [102 TFEU] is unrelated to its compliance or non-compliance with other legal rules” and that “in the majority of cases, abuses of dominant positions consist of behaviour which is otherwise lawful under branches of law other than competition law”.137", "Therefore, the fact that strategic patenting is lawful under patent law should not protect this practice from the competition law scrutiny.138 Furthermore, while it is true that patents provide the right to exclude others from using inventions, this, however, does not mean that the patent system may be used by a dominant firm as a tool for maintaining and strengthening its monopoly.139 As Ullrich argues, “the patent system is based on the idea of dynamic competition and not on the idea of competition to obtain a true monopoly covering the entire market, even if only temporarily”.140 In other words, once the procurement of patents by a dominant firm becomes a means for extending monopoly and harming competition, competition authorities must intervene.141", "Based on these principles, developed in EU case law, this article argues that strategic patenting should be subject to scrutiny under the rules of competition law.", "Considering their significant negative effects, competition authorities should have the possibility to investigate not only practices related to the exercise of IP rights, but also strategies based on their existence, even if they are considered lawful under patent law.", "It is believed that the approach put forward in this article will allow the removal of artificial barriers to generic competition and, as a result, will facilitate access to affordable medicines.", "A patent gives its owner the legal right to exclude others from using his invention for a limited number of years, in exchange for disclosing the invention to the public.", "During the period of protection, the owner can recoup his investments in R&D; this acts as a reward for innovation, as well as an incentive to engage in further innovative activities.", "Patent protection is particularly important for the pharmaceutical industry. As the development of a drug is very expensive and time-consuming, pharmaceutical companies require sufficient protection to recoup their investments and earn profits, which in turn would allow financing further R&D.", "However, some pharmaceutical companies may use the patent system for a different purpose, i.e. they procure numerous secondary patents that create multi-layer protection around their successful products to avoid competition on the merits.", "Such strategic patenting allows pharmaceutical companies to strengthen their monopoly positions, and thus to continue charging high drug prices.", "Moreover, this article argues that such a practice is against the shared goal of patent and competition laws that are aimed at incentivising innovation, as it reduces the incentives for originators to innovate, harms follow-on innovation by generic companies and disturbs a fragile balance between patent monopoly and competition.", "It is, therefore, submitted in this article that while currently strategic patenting is considered a lawful practice, it should attract the attention of the European Commission and national competition authorities.", "Based on the principles developed in EU competition law, it is argued that strategic patenting should be subject to scrutiny under the rules of competition law.", "The approach put forward in this article will allow competition authorities to investigate strategic patenting, preventing its negative effect on competition and harm to consumer welfare.", "Prabhala and Hoen (2020) (“there is every indication that treatments for coronavirus may soon emerge, the mere fact of their existence is no guarantee that people will be able to access them.", "In fact, Covid-19 is more likely to end in the same way that every pandemic ends: treatments and vaccines will be buried in a thicket of patents – and pharmaceutical companies will ultimately make the decisions about who lives and who dies”.", "“Remdesivir, a medicine developed for Ebola by the biotechnology company Gilead, has major patents across the world that last until 2038”); Morten and Moss (2020); The Public Citizen (2020) (explaining that “Remdesivir, an experimental COVID-19 treatment, has benefited significantly from public funding”.", "Despite this the patents protecting Remdesivir are owned by Gilead).", "Mancini (2020) (“Study argues prices for potential treatments are far higher than the actual cost of production”).", "IMAK (2018), p. 3; Correa (2011), p. 2; Ho (2015), p. 312; Light and Lexchin (2012), p. 23 (“This is the real innovation crisis: pharmaceutical research and development turns out mostly minor variations on existing drugs, and most new drugs are not superior on clinical measures”).", "EFPIA (2018), p. 6; Keyhani et al.

electric system by 2050.", "Most notable in the updated proposal, filed as part of reply comments in the long-term energy plan known as an Integrated Resource Plan (IRP), is the absence of the Sherco gas-fired power plant.", "The Minnesota Center for Environmental Advocacy, Fresh Energy, Clean Grid Alliance, and the Union of Concerned Scientists – collectively the Clean Energy Organizations (CEO) – applaud Xcel’s decision to bring forward an alternative to the new combined-cycle gas plant proposed in its previously filed IRP, especially one that includes significant new investments in wind and solar.", "CEO’s modeling, using the same software as Xcel, shows that the Sherco plant is unnecessary, unaffordable and contradictory to the company’s own data and modeling, the latest science on climate change, and Xcel’s carbon-reduction goals.", "The CEOs are also encouraged and excited about new investments in clean energy included in the proposal, reflecting Xcel’s commitment and ability to be an industry leader on climate change.", "Not only is the new long-range plan hundreds of millions less expensive for ratepayers, it would cut carbon emissions 86 percent by 2030, up from 80 percent in the original proposal.", "It also includes a new and innovative transmission “extension cord” line that would connect Xcel’s existing grid infrastructure to southwest Minnesota, unlocking thousands of megawatts of renewable energy from the richest renewable energy region in the state that would otherwise have no available transmission capacity.", "While the new proposal is undoubtedly a significant improvement from Xcel’s earlier IRP, our CEOs look forward to taking a closer look at the plan and digging into the data and details in the coming weeks.", "We want to see if data and modeling shows that other components of the proposal – such as the construction of two smaller peaker power plants that will run only occasionally – are truly necessary or whether alternative, carbon-free solutions are available.", "If you’re an Xcel customer, we encourage you to use the box to the right to tell Xcel to strongly consider all alternatives to new fossil fuel infrastructure like the peaker plants.", "We appreciate Xcel’s willingness to respond to Minnesota and the nation’s imperative to get to 100 percent clean energy sooner, while minimizing fossil fuels.", "CEOs drafted our own alternative energy plan — which we filed with the Public Utilities Commission (PUC) in February — that indicates Minnesota’s energy sector can and should be even more robustly supported by renewables in the future.", "Investor-owned utilities in Minnesota are required by law to submit plans every two years to the PUC that outline how they aim to meet their energy demands for the next 15 years.", "Xcel filed its first IRP back in 2019, and while it includes important strides toward a cleaner grid — notably Xcel’s announcement to retire its two remaining coal-fired plants – its inclusion of a new $2 billion gas-fired power plant to be built in Sherco does not make sense in 2021.", "“We are delighted to see Xcel take bold action to move more quickly to a carbon-free electricity system,” stated Ellen Anderson, Climate Program Director of the Minnesota Center for Environmental Advocacy.", "“Xcel’s new plan omits the large gas power plant, and chooses lower cost, lower carbon alternatives that will accelerate renewable energy and help us meet the need for immediate climate action.”", "“We applaud Xcel Energy putting forward an innovative solution that utilizes significant amounts of new wind, solar and transmission rather than a very large and risky new fossil gas plant,” said Allen Gleckner, Lead Director, Clean Electricity at Fresh Energy.", "“Creatively leveraging existing grid connections along with some of the Upper Midwest’s best wind and solar resources is a responsible way to both help Minnesota meet its climate goals and keep costs down for customers.”", "“Clean Grid Alliance commends Xcel Energy for taking the next steps on infrastructure needed to add new renewables and particularly unlocking additional wind energy in the western MISO footprint,” said Clean Grid Alliance Executive Director Beth Soholt.", "“The wind resources are extremely cost effective for ratepayers and provide many benefits for local communities, landowners, and workers in Minnesota.", "The additional transmission capacity is a much-needed outlet for the outstanding wind resources available in the Midwest.”", "“The climate and customers’ wallets will benefit from Xcel’s new proposal,” said James Gignac, senior Midwest energy analyst with the Union of Concerned Scientists.", "“Xcel should be commended for its efforts to identify cleaner and more cost-effective solutions. Minnesotans deserve healthier air and a safer energy system.”", "Amid the worsening climate crisis, state and federal leaders have made critical promises to drastically cut carbon emissions to head off the worst impacts of climate change.", "To meet these urgent goals, all sectors of society, and especially the energy industry, cannot continue to invest in old ways of doing business that we now know have catastrophic consequences for the livability of our planet.", "CEOs hope other companies follow Xcel’s lead and accelerate work to transition to a carbon-free future."]}

significant difference in meal planning was observed in relation with the presence of children in the household.", "This result appears in contrast with previous qualitative studies suggesting that the presence of children increases the feeling of time scarcity [17, 23–26, 60] and therefore the need of developing time-saving strategies, such as meal planning.", "However, fatigue and time scarcity can also decrease the likelihood for following meal plans [26].", "To our knowledge, this study is the first to describe meal planning practices in a general population sample.", "Overall, more than one out two participants revealed to plan their meals at least occasionally. Generally, individuals planned their meals several times a week, for a few days period including weekdays and weekend, and get inspiration mostly from their personal recipe repertoire or ingredients available during grocery shopping.", "A previous survey evaluating Canadians’ attitudes and habits with regard to home food preparation highlighted that about 40% of the participants decide what they will prepare for dinner during the day, 27% the day before and 33% at least two days before [29].", "However, the latter did not explore the modalities of meal planning.", "Based on a large sample of general population, our data support the notion that planning meal is indeed associated with a better adherence to nutritional guidelines and an increased food variety (overall, fruits and vegetables).", "However, it should be noted that only small differences were observed with energy, macronutrient and food group intakes specifically.", "Although meal planning has been previously suggested as a potential tool to improve dietary quality [28, 29], to our knowledge, no study in the literature has investigated this related association.", "Previous authors highlighted that individuals deciding in advance what to prepare for dinner were more likely to cook homemade dishes [29].", "Since more frequent food preparation has been linked with a better diet quality [12–14], this could potentially explain the healthier diet observed in meal planners.", "A few hypotheses can be made on how meal planning could encourage home food preparation. First, meal planning might address the issue of not knowing what to prepare for dinner, that has been previously described as a barrier for home meal preparation [29].", "Second, by planning meals individuals may think about recipes that can be prepared in a limited period of time and, therefore reduce the feeling of time scarcity, that may limit home meal preparation", "[6, 12, 16] and increase the recourse to food choice coping strategies such as eating out, delivery meals or ready prepared food", "[17, 23–25]. In addition, planning meals may reduce the risk of missing ingredients for home meal preparation which could also lead to the consumption of food prepared away from home.", "Finally, deciding what foods will be eaten in the next few days could also enable individuals to cook more diversified recipes and to anticipate grocery shopping for the specific ingredients needed, thus potentially explaining the increased food variety observed in meal planners.", "However, reverse causality cannot be excluded since individuals interested in having a healthy diet might be more likely to plan their meals.", "In line with this idea, meal-planners in our sample were more likely to have higher educational level, to have higher income, to be physically active and to have a lower BMI, characteristics that have been related with a better attitude towards healthy eating [61].", "Our results showed that women who planned meals were less likely to be overweight or obese, while in men, there was an association with obesity only.", "Since meal planners have a diet of higher quality, it potentially prevents overweight in these individuals [52].", "However, we cannot exclude reverse causality. People attaching more importance to food and weight management might be more likely to plan their meals.", "In line with this hypothesis, two studies in the literature highlighted that meal planning is more frequently used by successful weight loss maintainers compared to those who did not maintain weight losses [36, 37].", "In terms of public health, our results bring supportive insights that promoting meal planning might encourage the preparation of healthier and more varied home meals.", "Previous studies showed that parents would be interested in learning how to plan meals [28, 60], however, other findings suggested that meal planning is also perceived as complex and time consuming [62].", "Specific tools might assist people in managing meal planning but to be adopted and sustainable over time, it is important to identify consumers’ needs.", "The present data highlighted that there are various ways of planning meals. As an example, we observed that the ingredients available during grocery shopping are likely to influence meal planning while existing tools rather propose menus to plan grocery shopping.", "A major strength of this study was its large sample size allowing an evaluation of meal planning practices at a population level.", "The wide range of socio-economic and lifestyle variables collected through the web-based platform enables the control of potential effects of confounding factors.", "In addition, the web-based tool used to assess 24-h dietary records has shown a good validity in prior studies [63, 64].", "However, because of the influence of seasonality on food variety, the FFQ was used to evaluate dietary variety since it allows usual intake estimates over a relatively long period of time [65].", "This study was also subject to several limitations. First, the cross-sectional design of this study prevented any inference of causality.", "Moreover, since participants were volunteers in a nutrition focused cohort, they may have higher health consciousness and interest in nutritional issues.", "The fact that we selected only participants who completed both dietary assessment tools might have exacerbated this characteristic in our sample.", "Therefore, caution is needed when generalizing our results. However, sensitivity analyses including individuals with at least one of the dietary assessments (24-h dietary records or FFQ) revealed similar trends.", "Besides, the fact that participants had relatively high knowledge in nutrition could potentially account for the few differences observed in energy and food group intakes, since they may be able to cook healthful meals without planning meals.", "It is also important to consider that food variety score was based on FFQ data, which has been recorded at different time frames (16 months after the inclusion in the cohort).", "Thus, for participants included since a long time in the cohort study, the estimation may not represent their current dietary repertoire.", "In addition, data were self-reported, thus potentially leading to misreporting due, for example, to desirability bias.", "Nonetheless, previous validation studies performed on a subsample of the NutriNet-Santé study have supported the good validity of self-reported anthropometric and dietary data [63, 64, 66].", "Finally, given that meal planning may be influenced by numerous parameters such as cooking practices and food availability in the surrounding, it is possible that some factors mediating the associations observed in the present paper were not taken into account in the analyses.", "The potential impact of cooking practices was however considered by adding cooking frequency as a confounder.", "Future research should be conducted to address the issue of how food availability could potentially influence the relationship observed between meal planning and diet quality.", "Our results highlighted that individuals planning their meals were more likely to have a better dietary quality, including a higher adherence with nutritional guidelines as well as an increased food variety.", "Additionally, meal planning was associated with lower odds of being obese in men and women and overweight in women only.", "Although interventional or prospective research should be conducted in order to infer causality, these data suggest the potential interest of promoting meal planning to improve dietary quality and prevent overweight.", "Such a tool could partly address the issue of time scarcity reported by consumers for meal preparation and, might therefore encourage home cooking.", "Given the potential benefits of meal planning identified in this study, it would be interesting that future research evaluate the appropriation and the impact of applications designed to help individuals planning their meals.", "We thank all scientists, dieticians, technicians, and assistants who help carry out the NutriNet-Santé study.", "We especially thank Younes Esseddik, Yasmina Chelghoum, Mohand Ait Oufella, Paul Flanzy and Thi Hong Van Duong, computer scientists; Veronique Gourlet, Charlie Menard, Fabien Szabo, Nathalie Arnault, Laurent Bourhis and Stephen Besseau, statisticians; and the dieticians.", "We are grateful to volunteers from the NutriNet-Santé study.", "The NutriNet-Santé Study is supported by the French Ministry of Health (DGS), the French Institute for Public Health Surveillance (InVS), the French National Institute for Health and Medical Research (INSERM), the French National Institute for Agricultural Research (INRA), the Medical Research Foundation (FRM), the National Conservatory for Arts and Crafts (CNAM), the National Institute for Prevention and Health Education (INPES) and the University of Paris 13.", "This study is supported by the National Institute for Prevention and Health Education (INPES).", "In France, there is a very strict regulation concerning the protection of personal data and privacy making difficult the availability of data (even non-nominal data).", "PD: conducted the literature review, drafted the manuscript and performed analyses; CM, VA, GI, BA, EKG, SH and SP: were involved in the interpretation of results and critically reviewed the manuscript; and SH and SP: were responsible for the development of the design and the protocol of the study.", "All authors read and approved the final manuscript.", "The authors declare that they have no competing interests.", "This study is conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki, and all procedures were approved by the Institutional Review Board of the French Institute for Health and Medical Research (IRB Inserm n°0000388FWA00005831) and the Commission Nationale de l’Informatique et des Libertés (CNIL n°908450 and n°909216).", "All participants provided informed consent with an electronic signature.

This study is registered in EudraCT (n°2013-000929-31).", "Meal planning practices were assessed via an optional questionnaire launched in the NutriNet-Santé cohort study in April 2014.", "First, grocery shopping and cooking practices were evaluated. In particular, participants were asked to indicate whether they were involved in grocery shopping (every day, several times a week, once a week, less than once a week) and cooking (every day twice a day, every day once a day, several times a week but not every day, once a week, less than once a week, never) in their household.", "Then, participants were asked the following question “Generally, when do you choose the foods you are going to eat for meal?”", "(just before meal, during the day, the day before, few days before, one week before, never). Participants responding “never” were exempted to complete the rest of the questionnaire.", "Participants were also asked whether having to think about what they have to cook is a constraint for them.", "The responses were rated on a 5-point Likert scale ranging from one (strongly disagree) to five (strongly agree).", "Participants were then asked whether they planned meals, even in an irregular manner (yes I do, yes I did but not anymore, no I never planned meals).", "The definition of “planning meals” given to the participants was “to plan ahead the foods that will be eaten for the next few days”.", "Participants who reported planning meal currently were considered as “meal planners” whereas others were categorized as “non-meal planners”.", "Finally, the questionnaire included questions about meal planning frequency (several times a week, once a week, once every two weeks, two to three times a month, not regularly), duration (a few days, one week, two weeks or more), period of the week (weekdays, weekend, weekdays and weekend) and sources of inspiration (personal recipe repertoire, Internet or apps, ingredients available during grocery shopping).", "At baseline and annually thereafter, participants in the NutriNet-Santé study are asked to provide socio-demographic data, including sex, age (18–30, 30–50, 50–65, >65 years), educational level (up to secondary, some college or university degree), monthly income (<1,200 €, 1,200–1,800 €, 1,800–2,700 € and >2,700 € per consumption unit), presence of children in the household (yes, no), history of dieting to lose weight during the past year (yes, no) and physical activity (low, moderate, high).", "Monthly household income is calculated per “consumption unit” (CU), where one CU is attributed for the first adult in the household, 0.5 CU for other persons aged 14 or older, and 0.3 CU for children under 14, following national statistics methodology and guidelines [39].", "Physical activity was assessed using a short form of the French version of the International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ).", "The weekly energy expenditure expressed in metabolic equivalent task minutes per week was estimated, and three scores of physical activity were constituted [i.e., low (<30 min/day), moderate (30–59 min/day), and high (≥60 min/day)]", "according to the French guidelines for physical activity [40].", "For the present study, we used the closest available data with respect to the assessment of meal planning practices.", "At inclusion and once a year thereafter, participants are invited to complete three non-consecutive 24-h dietary records, randomly assigned over a 2-week period (two weekdays and one weekend day).", "For the present analysis, we selected participants who completed at least three 24-h dietary records since their inclusion in the cohort study (i.e. completed between May 2009 and December 2014).", "Participants reported all foods and beverages consumed at each eating occasion. They estimated the amounts eaten using validated photographs of portion sizes [41], using household measures or by indicating the exact quantity (grams) or volume (milliliters).", "Daily mean food intakes were calculated, weighted for the type of day of the week. Energy, nutrient and food group intakes were estimated using the NutriNet-Santé composition table including more than 2000 foods [42].", "Dietary underreporting was identified on the basis of the method proposed by Black [43]. We hypothesize that meal planning encourages food preparation and therefore considered food groups that can be used in food preparation (e.g. eggs).", "In addition, we considered food groups that have nutritional interest (e.g. fruits). Thus, the following food groups were included in the study: fruits, vegetables, fish (including seafood and processed seafood), meat (including cooked ham, offal), eggs, milk, cheese, added fats (including oil, butter, margarine, vinaigrette), sugary products (e.g. cake, biscuits, sugars, honey, jam, chocolate) and starchy foods (including potato, legumes, pasta, rice, other cereals) with a specific focus on legumes and whole grain starchy foods (including whole grain pasta, rice, other cereals).", "Adherence to nutritional guidelines was assessed using the PNNS Guideline Score (PNNS-GS). The 15-point PNNS-GS is a validated a priori score reflecting the adherence to the official French nutritional guidelines which has been extensively described elsewhere [44].", "Details on computation of this score are in Additional file 1. Briefly, it includes 13 components: eight refer to food-serving recommendations (fruit and vegetables; starchy foods; whole grain products; dairy products; meat, eggs and fish; fish and seafood; vegetable fat; water vs. soda), four refer to moderation in consumption (added fat; salt; sweets; alcohol) and one component pertains to physical activity [44, 45].", "Points are deducted for overconsumption of salt (>12 g/day), added sugars (>17.5% of energy intake), or when energy intake exceeds the needed energy level by more than 5%.", "Each component cut-off was that of the threshold defined by the PNNS public health objectives when available [45] otherwise they were established according to the French Recommended Dietary Allowances [46].", "For the present analysis, we consider the mPNNS-GS, a modified version of the PNNS-GS, which takes into account only the dietary components, therefore excluding the physical activity component.", "Food variety has been defined as the number of different food items reported to be eaten over a given reference period [47].", "Considering that seasonality is likely to influence food variety and that a period of 10 to 15 days has been recommended to accurately assess food variety [48], the food variety was evaluated using a Food Frequency Questionnaire (FFQ).", "Sixteen months after baseline, participants were invited to complete a self-administrated 240-items FFQ to assess their usual dietary intake over the past year [49].", "Participants were asked to report their consumption frequency on the basis of how many times they ate the standard portion size proposed (typical household measurements such as spoon or standard unit such as a yogurt).", "The frequency of consumption referred to usual consumption over the past year on an increasing scale including yearly, monthly, weekly or daily units, as suitable, and participants were asked to provide only one answer.", "The food variety score corresponded to the number of FFQ items reported to be consumed at least once during the last year [47].", "The maximum score was therefore 240. Fruit and vegetable variety scores were also computed based on the number of different fruits and vegetables reported by the participants.", "Height and weight were assessed by using an anthropometric questionnaire, which was self-administered online, at baseline and each year thereafter [50, 51].", "For each participant, the closest available data to the meal planning questionnaire were used for the analysis.", "Data were not collected for pregnant women. BMI (in kg/m2) was calculated as the ratio of weight to squared height.", "Participants were classified as underweight or normal weight (BMI < 25), overweight (25 ≤ BMI < 30) and obesity (BMI ≥ 30) according to WHO references values [52].", "The analysis focused on participants who had completed the meal planning questionnaire, had declared being involved in meal preparation in their household, and who had completed at least three 24-h dietary records since they were included in the study, as well as the FFQ.", "Chi-square tests and Student’s t tests were used to compare characteristics of included vs. excluded participants, as well as meal planners vs. non-meal planners.", "Meal planners’ practices were also described. Continuous variables are presented as means ± SDs and categorical variables as percentages.", "ANCOVAs were performed to investigate the relationship between meal planning and energy, macronutrients and food groups.", "However, for some particular food groups which did not exhibit normal distribution (i.e. eggs, milk, legumes, and whole grain starchy foods), mainly due to a high proportion of non-consumers, a binary variable (consumer/non-consumer) was created and a logistic regression analysis was performed.", "Logistic regression models were also used to assess the associations between meal planning and quartiles of mPNNS-GS, as well as quartiles of food variety scores (overall, fruit and vegetable) and BMI categories.", "Due to significant interactions and differences on the associations with meal planning, analyses on BMI were performed separately by sex.", "Meal planning has been described as a cooking skill [53]. Thus, characteristics that have been shown to influence cooking practices, dietary intakes or weight status were considered as confounders in the present analyses.", "Models were therefore all adjusted for sex [1, 54, 55], age [56], educational level, monthly income [6], presence of children in the household [6], history of dieting to lose weight during the past year [57], physical activity [58], and cooking frequency.", "Models evaluating the associations with mPNNS-GS, macronutrient and food groups intakes were further adjusted for daily energy intake and number of 24-h dietary records completed by participants.", "The energy model was only adjusted on the number of 24-h records while the food variety models were adjusted on daily energy intake.", "Missing covariate data were imputed using multiple imputation method.", "Sensitivity analyses were conducted on a subsample of individuals having responded to at least one of the dietary assessments (i.e. FFQ, dietary records).", "In addition, analyses were conducted using another definition of food variety score (number of FFQ items reported to be consumed more than once a week)", "All tests of statistical significance were two-sided and the type I error was set at 5%.

First, meal planning might address the issue of not knowing what to prepare for dinner, that has been previously described as a barrier for home meal preparation [29].", "Second, by planning meals individuals may think about recipes that can be prepared in a limited period of time and, therefore reduce the feeling of time scarcity, that may limit home meal preparation", "[6, 12, 16] and increase the recourse to food choice coping strategies such as eating out, delivery meals or ready prepared food", "[17, 23–25]. In addition, planning meals may reduce the risk of missing ingredients for home meal preparation which could also lead to the consumption of food prepared away from home.", "Finally, deciding what foods will be eaten in the next few days could also enable individuals to cook more diversified recipes and to anticipate grocery shopping for the specific ingredients needed, thus potentially explaining the increased food variety observed in meal planners.", "However, reverse causality cannot be excluded since individuals interested in having a healthy diet might be more likely to plan their meals.", "In line with this idea, meal-planners in our sample were more likely to have higher educational level, to have higher income, to be physically active and to have a lower BMI, characteristics that have been related with a better attitude towards healthy eating [61].", "Our results showed that women who planned meals were less likely to be overweight or obese, while in men, there was an association with obesity only.", "Since meal planners have a diet of higher quality, it potentially prevents overweight in these individuals [52].", "However, we cannot exclude reverse causality.

As an example, we observed that the ingredients available during grocery shopping are likely to influence meal planning while existing tools rather propose menus to plan grocery shopping.", "A major strength of this study was its large sample size allowing an evaluation of meal planning practices at a population level.", "The wide range of socio-economic and lifestyle variables collected through the web-based platform enables the control of potential effects of confounding factors.", "In addition, the web-based tool used to assess 24-h dietary records has shown a good validity in prior studies [63, 64].", "However, because of the influence of seasonality on food variety, the FFQ was used to evaluate dietary variety since it allows usual intake estimates over a relatively long period of time [65].", "This study was also subject to several limitations. First, the cross-sectional design of this study prevented any inference of causality.", "Moreover, since participants were volunteers in a nutrition focused cohort, they may have higher health consciousness and interest in nutritional issues.", "The fact that we selected only participants who completed both dietary assessment tools might have exacerbated this characteristic in our sample.", "Therefore, caution is needed when generalizing our results. However, sensitivity analyses including individuals with at least one of the dietary assessments (24-h dietary records or FFQ) revealed similar trends.", "Besides, the fact that participants had relatively high knowledge in nutrition could potentially account for the few differences observed in energy and food group intakes, since they may be able to cook healthful meals without planning meals.", "It is also important to consider that food variety score was based on FFQ data, which has been recorded at different time frames (16 months after the inclusion in the cohort).", "Thus, for participants included since a long time in the cohort study, the estimation may not represent their current dietary repertoire.", "In addition, data were self-reported, thus potentially leading to misreporting due, for example, to desirability bias.", "Nonetheless, previous validation studies performed on a subsample of the NutriNet-Santé study have supported the good validity of self-reported anthropometric and dietary data [63, 64, 66].", "Finally, given that meal planning may be influenced by numerous parameters such as cooking practices and food availability in the surrounding, it is possible that some factors mediating the associations observed in the present paper were not taken into account in the analyses.", "The potential impact of cooking practices was however considered by adding cooking frequency as a confounder.", "Future research should be conducted to address the issue of how food availability could potentially influence the relationship observed between meal planning and diet quality.", "Our results highlighted that individuals planning their meals were more likely to have a better dietary quality, including a higher adherence with nutritional guidelines as well as an increased food variety.", "Additionally, meal planning was associated with lower odds of being obese in men and women and overweight in women only.", "Although interventional or prospective research should be conducted in order to infer causality, these data suggest the potential interest of promoting meal planning to improve dietary quality and prevent overweight.", "Such a tool could partly address the issue of time scarcity reported by consumers for meal preparation and, might therefore encourage home cooking.", "Given the potential benefits of meal planning identified in this study, it would be interesting that future research evaluate the appropriation and the impact of applications designed to help individuals planning their meals.", "Modified Programme National Nutrition Santé-Guideline Score", "Smith LP, Ng SW, Popkin BM.

It was believed that the outrage", "was deliberately designed, and the cry for vengeance burst from the", "whole people. In full assembly, with the venerable General Matthews", "presiding, they appointed, as in the days of '76, a Committee of Safety.", "A preamble, duly setting forth the outrage on the \"Chesapeake,\" was", "adopted, and it was resolved that there should be no intercourse with", "the British frigates in the Norfolk waters, or with their agents, until", "the decision of the United States Government was known, under the", "penalty of being deemed infamous; and the Committee of Safety—", "Thomas Matthews, Thomas Newton, Jr., Luke Wheeler, Theodric", "Armistead, Richard E. Lee, Moses Myers, William Pennock, William", "Newsum, Thomas Blanchard, Daniel Bedinger, Seth Foster, J. W.", "Murdaugh, Richard Blow, and Francis S. Taylor—were authorized to", "take such measures as the emergency demanded. As soon as the British", "commander—Commodore Douglas—read the resolves, he addressed,", "on the 3d of July, an insolent letter to the Mayor of the Borough, in", "which he declared if the resolutions were not instantly annulled, he would", "prohibit every vessel bound in or out of Norfolk from proceeding to", "her place of destination. He closed his communication by saying that", "he had proceeded with his squadron of four fifty-gun frigates to Hampton", "Roads to await the answer of the Mayor, which he hoped would be", "forwarded without delay. It is thought that Mr. Tazewell had regulated", "the popular proceedings from their initiation. In the delicate dilemma,", "which was ominous of vengeful deeds and of so much menace to the", "commercial interests of Norfolk, he came to the assistance of the Mayor", "and dictated a reply to the audacious Briton which elicited the admiration", "of the whole American Nation.

In", "1820 Mr. Tazewell was one of the Commissioners under the Florida", "treaty. In 1824 he was elected to the United States Senate. He was", "elected to fill a vacancy caused by the resignation of John Taylor of", "Caroline. It is a coincidence that his father, thirty years before, was", "chosen to fill the vacancy in the Senate caused by the resignation of the", "same individual. L. W. Tazewell took his seat in January, 1825. His", "first efforts in the debates was on the bankrupt bill of that session—", "a searching examination of its details, which annihilated the hopes of its", "friends. His speech, on the 21st of January, in behalf of his motion", "to strike out the third section of the bill for the suppression of piracy", "in the West India seas, which had been reported from the Committee", "of Foreign Affairs, and had been introduced by its chairman, James", "Barbour, was lauded throughout the country. The section proposed to", "be stricken out authorized the President of the United States in time of", "profound peace to declare, on the representations of a naval officer,", "any of the ports of Spain in the West Indies in a state of blockade.", "It was stricken out by the decisive vote of 37 to 10. Had it remained", "in the bill, a war with Spain in all probability would have resulted", "in less than ninety days. On the election of John Quincy Adams to", "the Presidency, Mr. Tazewell became hostile to his administration and", "competency of the executive to originate foreign missions without", "the advice and consent of the Senate, as a constitutional thesis, it", "is claimed, \"stands pre-eminent in our political literature as a model of", "profound research, of thorough argumentation, and of overwhelming", "strength.\" Mr. Tazewell was re-elected to the Senate on the 1st day", "of January, 1829. Whilst in attendance on that body he was elected", "by the Norfolk district a member of the Convention which assembled in", "Richmond, October 5th, 1829, to revise the first Constitution of Virginia.", "In that illustrious body Mr. Tazewell made the opening speech", "in support of a resolution which he offered, and which marked out the", "course of the campaign which he believed to be best adapted to attain", "the general end in view. He engaged with conspicuous ability in the", "important discussions of the convention. His speech on the tenure of", "the judicial office is claimed to have been one of the most able efforts in", "that body of intellectual giants. Mr. Tazewell was also, in 1829,", "tendered the mission to Great Britain, but declined the honor. He", "continued in the Senate until 1833, serving as Chairman of the Committee", "on Foreign Relations, and as President pro tem. of the body during", "a portion of the twenty-second Congress. In January, 1834, he", "was elected Governor of Virginia to succeed John Floyd, and entered", "upon the duties of his office March 31st. He resigned March 31, 1836,", "before the expiration of the term, upon a disagreement with the State", "Legislature. That body had passed resolutions instructing the Senators", "from Virginia to vote for the resolutions to expunge from the journal of", "the Senate the resolutions censuring General Jackson. These instructions", "Governor Tazewell declined to approve. He was succeeded in the office of", "Governor by Lieutenant-Governor Wyndham Robertson. Mr. Tazewell", "was never afterwards in public service. Though so effective with", "juries as an advocate, his style of address is said to have been singularly", "simple and free from artifice. His arguments were conversational and", "his gestures not more striking than those of animated converse. His", "postures were negligent. His voice was pleasant and of ample compass.", "He was never vociferous. His logic was consummate, and in putting", "his arguments before a jury he exhibited great adroitness. He acquainted", "himself with the calling or prejudices of every juryman—and", "When the passions were to be assailed he indulged in a style of fervid", "appeal, which was the more effective as it was rare. Of the person of", "Mr. Tazewell, his friend and eulogist, Hugh Blair Grigsby, LL.D.,", "says: \"As soon as the visitor fixed his eyes on Mr. Tazewell, all else", "was forgotten. He was, without exception, in middle life, the most imposing,", "and in old age, the most venerable person I ever beheld. His", "height exceeded six feet. * * * His head and chest were on a large", "scale, and his vast blue eye, which always seemed to gaze afar, was aptly", "handsome. In middle life he was very thin, though lithe and strong,\"", "but in his latter days he was large of stature, with massive features,", "and hair of silvery whiteness, which fell in ringlets about his neck.", "He died at Norfolk, May 6, 1860.

In 1830, the Granger family moved from Vermont to upstate New York, where after a brief period at an academy Stephen Douglass began to read law under a locally prominent Democratic attorney.", "In 1833, Stephen made his way west to seek his career and fortune. After arriving in Quincy, Illinois, and operating a private school for a time, he secured a law license and set up practice in Jacksonville, Illinois.", "As he established the basis for a professional career, Stephen also changed the spelling of his last name from Douglass to Douglas.", "Stephen A. Douglas first became politically known in Illinois as a staunch Democratic proponent of President Andrew Jackson.", "Between 1835 and 1840, Douglas held a succession of Illinois state offices, some of them concurrently, including state’s attorney, state legislator, register of the Springfield land office, and secretary of state.", "In 1841, at the age of twenty-seven, he was elected to a seat on the Illinois Supreme Court. In 1836, he lost a disputed race for the U.S. House of Representatives by thirty-six popular votes.", "Four years later he lost a campaign for a U.S. Senate seat by five legislative votes. Only in 1843, running in a newly created congressional district, was Douglas able to win a seat in the House.", "As a member of the House of Representatives, Douglas was among those urging an extension of United States territory from the Atlantic to the Pacific.", "He called for the annexation of Texas, the establishment of military posts along the Western emigrant trails, and organization of a Nebraska territorial government.", "By 1845, these and other strong expansionist positions had won Douglas the chairmanship of the House Committee on Territories.", "Through a congressional colleague, Douglas met Martha Denny Martin (1825-1853), the daughter of a wealthy North Carolina planter and a member of a family long prominent in North Carolina political affairs.", "When Stephen and Martha were married in 1847, Robert Martin offered his new son-in-law his 2,500-acre plantation on the Pearl River in Lawrence County, Mississippi.", "Douglas declined the gift, but after Martin died a year later, the Pearl River plantation was bequeathed to Martha and any children she might have.", "Douglas was designated as the property manager and was allocated 20 per cent of the plantation’s annual income for his services.", "Two children born to their marriage survived into adulthood, Robert Martin Douglas (1849-1917) and Stephen Arnold Douglas, Jr. (1850-1908).", "In 1847, after only three years in the House of Representatives, Douglas was elected by the Illinois state legislature to a seat in the U.S. Senate, where he was made chairman of the Senate Committee on Territories.", "His position gave him an influential role in shaping all aspects of national policy affecting western lands, from the courts and post office to military posts and legislative powers.", "He also became quickly immersed in growing sectional disputes over the future of slavery. As a Senator from a state with a mix of strong anti-slavery and pro-slavery sentiment, and as the manager of a Mississippi plantation with more than 100 slaves, Douglas attempted to craft a political position that would avoid favoring either the North or South.", "The first significant test of this policy, the Compromise of 1850, is usually credited to Henry Clay, but it owed a great deal to Douglas' political skills.", "To satisfy the North, California was admitted as a free state, and the slave trade was abolished in the District of Columbia; to reassure the South, the territories of New Mexico and Utah were organized without a prohibition of slavery, and a rigid fugitive slave law was enacted.", "Despite this careful attempt to placate both sides in the slavery controversy, the reaction to the Compromise in the North was immediate and hostile.", "Douglas came under fierce attack in his home state and was able to calm his supporters only by rushing back to Illinois to defend himself before the Chicago city council and the state legislature.", "In 1853, Douglas sustained a grave personal loss when his wife Martha died following complications from the birth of a daughter.", "After their infant girl also died a few weeks later, a grieving Douglas decided to leave the country for an extended tour of Europe.", "His travels took him to London, Constantinople, Moscow, St. Petersburg, and Paris, in the course of which he secured a number of diplomatic audiences and met Czar Nicholas I and Emperor Napoleon III.", "Douglas' personal life did not recover its equilibrium until 1856, when he married twenty-one-year-old Rose Adele Cutts (1835-1899), known as Adele, whose father, James Madison Cutts, was a nephew of President James Madison and Dolley Madison.", "The new Mrs. Douglas accepted Douglas' two sons as her own and raised them with his approval in her own Catholic faith.", "Their infant daughter Ellen died shortly after birth in 1859. The Douglases built an imposing townhouse in Washington just north of Capitol Hill, and it soon became renowned for lavish parties and receptions.", "Douglas' personal affairs also changed in other respects. In 1857, Douglas sold the family plantation on the Pearl River, which had been affected by flooding and poor crops, and in partnership with James A. McHatton of Baton Rouge, moved the agricultural operation to a 2,000-acre property south of Greenville, Mississippi.", "Throughout his career, Douglas maintained a strong interest in science, education, and technological improvements.", "In 1850, Douglas secured the passage of federal legislation supporting the Illinois Central Railroad route from Chicago down the Mississippi Valley to New Orleans, thus helping to make Chicago and Illinois a national center for industry and commerce.", "Douglas was an enthusiastic supporter of the Smithsonian Institution from the time of its founding and in 1854 was appointed a regent of the Smithsonian.", "In 1858 Douglas gave ten acres on the south side of Chicago to serve as the site of the newly organized University of Chicago; the land was part of his Oakenwald estate, where Douglas planned to develop an exclusive suburban neighborhood and erect his own residence.", "Douglas' rising prominence in national affairs reached a crest in January 1854, when he introduced the Kansas-Nebraska bill to organize governments in the Kansas and Nebraska territories.", "In each territory, the question of slavery would be reserved until it entered the Union as a new state; at that time, the voting citizens would draw up a constitution and determine whether or not their state would permit slavery.", "The Kansas-Nebraska bill embodied Douglas' doctrine of popular sovereignty, according to which the voters in newly admitted states, not the federal government, would determine the future of slavery by exercising their democratic rights to self-government.", "Douglas also hoped that popular sovereignty would remove slavery from congressional debate and insulate the federal government from further sectional conflict.", "The Kansas-Nebraska Act, however, unleashed a new torrent of angry protest by Northern anti-slavery forces, who felt it opened the door to an expansion of slavery across the West.", "Douglas returned to Illinois to defend his position, touring the state for two months and twice trading opposing speeches with Abraham Lincoln, a former Whig legislator and congressman who reemerged on the political stage and became a spokesman for the new Republican Party.", "In the wake of the Kansas-Nebraska Act, Douglas also found himself at odds with important elements of the national Democratic party.", "He had first attempted to gain the Democratic nomination for president in 1852. In 1856, he tried once again for the presidential nomination, but withdrew his name in favor of James Buchanan, who went on to win the election.", "The brief alliance between Buchanan and Douglas ended within a year, however, when a pro-slavery convention meeting in Lecompton, Kansas, drew up a constitution proposing statehood and protecting property in slavery.", "Buchanan supported the Lecompton constitution, but Douglas was determined to block it, arguing that its passage was fraudulent and did not express the will of the people in accordance with popular sovereignty.", "Although Douglas could not prevent congressional approval of the constitution, it was later rejected by the voters of Kansas.", "The struggle over Kansas and the spread of slavery became the dominant theme in the Senate election campaign of 1858 in Illinois.", "Douglas was renominated by the Democrats, while Abraham Lincoln was selected as the Republican candidate.", "The campaign between Douglas and Lincoln gained unexpected attention when Lincoln pressed Douglas to agree to join in a series of debates.", "Staged in seven Illinois towns from August to October of 1858, the campaign debates between Douglas and Lincoln drew large crowds and generated detailed press coverage.", "Lincoln charged that Douglas was part of a slavery \"dynasty\" seeking to promote the spread of slavery over the entire nation.", "Douglas argued that Lincoln’s \"House Divided\" speech had pushed the country to the brink of division and that popular sovereignty would resolve the slavery issue.", "On election day, the Republicans won a majority of the popular vote across the state; the Illinois legislature, however, remained in the hands of the Democrats, and Douglas was returned to Washington for another Senate term.", "Douglas and Lincoln were to meet again in the tumultuous presidential election of 1860. Divisions within the Democratic Party had become so deep that when Democrats met first in Charleston and later in Baltimore for their nominating convention, the southern delegates walked out.", "Douglas was able to win the presidential nomination from the remaining northern delegates, but the breakaway Democrats turned to John C. Breckinridge of Kentucky as their candidate.", "The Constitutional Union party nominated John Bell of Tennessee, and the Republicans chose Abraham Lincoln to carry their banner, making the 1860 presidential election a four-way race.", "Douglas was so concerned about the sectional division in the Democratic party and the potential rupture of the federal Union that he decided to break with precedent and campaign on his own behalf, the first presidential candidate in American history to do so.", "Frequently accompanied by Adele, Douglas campaigned through all parts of the country, from New England, New York, and Pennsylvania to Virginia, Tennessee, Alabama, and Georgia.", "His desperate efforts to reunite the Democratic party, however, could not overcome the rapidly disintegrating political situation.", "In November 1860, none of the four presidential candidates secured a majority of the popular vote, but Abraham Lincoln carried the electoral college and won the White House.", "In the months following the presidential election, Douglas returned to Washington to join the efforts to prevent the secession of the southern states, engaging in a series of private meetings with Lincoln to map strategy.", "When the Illinois state legislature went into special session, Douglas traveled to Springfield to make an impassioned speech rallying citizens to a defense of the Union.", "Several weeks later, while staying the Tremont House hotel in Chicago, Douglas fell ill, and his condition soon began to deteriorate.", "On June 3, 1861, with his wife, Adele, at his side, he died.", "The funeral of Stephen A. Douglas was attended by more than 5,000 mourners. His body was laid to rest in a temporary tomb overlooking Lake Michigan, on the Oakenwald property that he had selected for his Chicago residence.", "In 1881, a permanent monument was erected on the site; its designer was Leonard W. Volk, whose wife was a cousin of Douglas and whose education as an artist had been sponsored by Douglas.", "The Civil War had immediate and devastating effects on Douglas family estate. In 1862, Camp Douglas, a Union military prison, was established at the northern end of the Oakenwald property; it housed more than 26,000 captured Confederate soldiers, of which 6,000 died.", "The Douglas mansion in Washington was turned over to the Federal government, and it was converted into a military hospital for the duration of the conflict.", "In Mississippi, the Greenville plantation was raided by Union troops, and the entire cotton crop was lost.", "Douglas' two sons later attempted to recover compensation from the federal government, but without success.", "After the war, Robert Martin Douglas graduated from Georgetown College, served as private secretary to President Ulysses S. Grant, and became a justice of the North Carolina Supreme Court.", "Stephen A. Douglas, Jr., who also studied at Georgetown, moved from North Carolina to Chicago and became an attorney.", "Adele Cutts Douglas remarried in 1866 to Brevet Brigadier General Robert Williams, who later became Adjutant General of the U.S. Army; they had six children.", "The Stephen A. Douglas collection is organized into seven series: Series I: Senate and Constituent Correspondence; Series II: Political; Series III: Personal; Series IV: Financial and Legal; Series V: Artifacts and Ephemera; Series VI: Oversized; and Series VII: Books.", "The largest portion of the collection is housed in Series I. This series contains the incoming correspondence of senators and constituents contemporary to Stephen A. Douglas, arranged chronologically from 1800 to 1867.", "Correspondence with unknown dates has been arranged alphabetically by the name signed and is located at the end of this series.", "Douglas' name has been abbreviated as SAD within Series I.", "Series II consists of materials pertaining to Douglas' political career.

However, we found that HLA-B*46:01 had the fewest predicted binding peptides for SARS-CoV-2, suggesting individuals with this allele may be particularly vulnerable to COVID-19, as they were previously shown to be for SARS (1).", "Conversely, we found that HLA-B*15:03 showed the greatest capacity to present highly conserved SARS-CoV-2 peptides that are shared among common human coronaviruses, suggesting it could enable cross-protective T-cell based immunity.", "Finally, we report global distributions of HLA types with potential epidemiological ramifications in the setting of the current pandemic.", "IMPORTANCE Part of why the immune response to a virus differs across individuals is explained by genetic variation, especially in the HLA genes.", "Understanding how variation in HLA may affect the course of COVID-19 could help identify individuals at higher risk from the disease.", "HLA typing can be fast and inexpensive.

Between 2001 and 2010, wind and utility-scale solar’s market share grew slowly but steadily to 2.4%.", "Coal’s share of annual electric-sector generation remained dominant, only falling from 53 percent in 2001 to 46 percent in 2010.", "By 2020, however, the list of companies becoming early adopters had rapidly expanded, and included a few major power companies like NextEra Energy and Xcel Energy.", "Wind and utility-scale solar’s market share began to rise faster, to more than 11 percent in 2020.

The other half is the clear turn away from coal by U.S. utilities and independent power producers.", "Data compiled by IEEFA shows that the amount of coal-fired capacity scheduled for retirement by 2030 has more than doubled in the past year.", "In March 2020, announced coal-fired retirements for the 2021-30 totaled 37.4 GW. By April 2021, that total had climbed to at least 75.5 GW.", "Those retirements, in turn, have pushed the cumulative amount of coal capacity that will have closed by 2030 to 175 GW—55 percent of the coal-fired capacity that existed at its peak in 2011.", "It is important to point out this rapid acceleration occurred largely prior to the Biden administration’s climate change summit and its embrace of a 2035 no-carbon emissions goal for U.S. power generators.", "With those developments now rippling through the sector, IEEFA expects a significant increase in the number of coal plant retirement announcements in the months and years ahead as utilities and independent power producers revise their resource plans and business models.", "Even after 100 GW of capacity had closed, the overall coal capacity factor was down to 40%", "The actual retirement numbers only tell part of the story, however. The plants still online are also operating less and less, with the average annual capacity factor of the installed coal plants falling from 62.8 percent in 2011 to 40.2 percent in 2020.", "This collapse belies the common coal industry refrain that as the older, less efficient plants were retired, the performance of the remaining units would improve; even after nearly 100GW of capacity had closed, the overall coal capacity factor was down sharply last year.", "Another way of measuring the S-curve ramp is to look at individual utilities. Here, recent announcements from American Electric Power, one of the largest utilities in the U.S., are indicative of the rapidly quickening pace of change.", "Six months ago, the utility was touting its plan to add roughly 8,000 megawatts (MW) of new renewable energy capacity to its 11-state system by 2030.", "Earlier this month, during its first quarter 2021 earnings call, the company literally doubled down, saying it now planned to build 16,595MW of new renewable capacity by 2030.", "AEP CEO Nick Akins said 10,000MW of that total would be online by 2025. Coupled with that buildout, the company now plans to retire another 4,979MW of coal-fired capacity by 2028, with an additional 595MW slated for 2030.", "AEP still has a way to go, as these plans do not address the company’s three large coal-fired plants in West Virginia—the single unit, 1,299MW Mountaineer station; the three-unit, 2,900MW John Amos plant and the two-unit, 1,560MW Mitchell station.", "However, IEEFA believes the company’s recent moves represent a shift that should be applauded, with reservations.", "In his opening remarks on the quarterly call, AEP’s Akins outlined the company’s next steps: “It has been a very busy quarter for AEP, but the work really starts now regarding the execution of our plan to transform this company from what was the largest coal-fired utility to one of the largest regulated renewable companies in the U.S.”", "His statement reflects neatly why the market share of wind and solar in the power sector is set to rise so fast this decade: The heart of the disruption S-curve is arriving.", "Dennis Wamsted ([email protected]) is an IEEFA analyst/editor.", "Seth Feaster ([email protected]) is an IEEFA energy data analyst.", "IEEFA: Birchwood coal facility closure/redevelopment highlights transition from coal to renewables", "IEEFA U.S.: Coal plants close as renewable energy construction rises"]}
