And this is the first earnings report (Netflix publishes their Q4 2020 report tomorrow) where we can really unpack all that data.", "Initially, I had hoped to make some quantitative predictions about Q4 2020 compared to past years and quarters.", "But frankly, I don’t have enough information to do that confidently. (We’re firmly in small sample size territory.)", "What I can do is provide a quick look at Netflix’s Q4 content. Then we can try to do what analysis we can and make some inferences.", "Nielsen’s data has been the most useful new data source we have this year. Specifically, because it shows the volume of consumption for a given show, week by week.", "The limitations are time frame and the total minutes viewed. Nielsen has only been providing a public top ten list since August.", "They provided me with data back to April—and I found three data points in March—but that still only provides us three quarters of data.", "Further, since the top ten list only has ten spots, we don’t get a full picture of Netflix’s original films and series.", "In particular, since Nielsen measures at the series level, some licensed titles are overrepresented. For example, four shows have made up a huge portion of Netflix’s viewing and three of them make the top ten list every week, meaning this is a top seven list for new Netflix shows/films at best.", "With that in mind, how does the picture look for Q4, given that we are missing two potentially big weeks of data (the last of the year)?", "I tried to play around with this data in a lot of different ways to show the average by month and by quarter, but given that Nielsen starts at different times of the month, it made March—the crucial month—look funky.", "So if we use Nielsen data, that means that Netflix is having a better quarter than Q3, but still dragging way behind the end of Q1/start of Q2 peak.", "I can’t stress how good Netflix’s March in the U.S. was with Spenser Confidential to start, Tiger King on 20-March and Ozark on 27-March.", "Remember, Ozark would be the most watched original on Netflix for the whole of 2020.

The challenge is that there are so many different ways to cut the data.", "So here’s Netflix’s films that netted over 38 million subscribers globally over time:", "You can see a few of the problems with this data. To start, we can’t use it to predict Q4’s performance, since Netflix has only released one movie data point for Q4 so far.", "Further, it’s noisy and it’s not clear that it’s correlated with adding subscribers. For example, Q3 had a number of 70 million plus viewed films, but it didn’t help Netflix grow subs in Q3.", "This is also a “tale of two data measurements” problem. If films are measured simply in total numbers, Netflix is growing each quarter.", "Measured by the percentage of folks tuning in, it’s shrinking.", "Let’s switch over to TV. In this case, Netflix has released three datecdotes so far, and the picture looks slightly better:", "In both cases, though, the big performance of The Queen’s Gambit and Bridgerton will likely pull up the content performance of this quarter.", "The Crown did very well in Nielsen’s rankings, so it could pull up the average as well.", "Interestingly, Netflix has tended towards a similar release strategy the last few years: release a big Christmas film in the middle of November, release the awards bait at the same time, release a big movie to close out the year and a big TV show as well.", "So can we learn anything here? I’d say not really, until we learn the rest of the Netflix datecdotes to round out 2020.", "As you can see, we don’t have the data points for this quarter. (Which I just mentioned above!)

A California Christmas is on the borderline.", "However, with Nielsen’s data, this doesn’t have to limit us as much as it did in the past. Specifically, we can also have a range for what we think Netflix’s datecdotes will be.", "Let’s be clear, this isn’t the most complex data analysis in the world. I’m basically making a scatter plot and having Excel draw the line through it for me.", "In other words, I’m guessing that we’ll hear data points about Hubie Halloween at around 74 million viewers, with The Christmas Chronicles 2 potentially well above that (92 million).", "Hillbilly Elegy would be around 50 million viewers. Here’s the ranges:", "With this, we could update the Q4 comparison above to see the potential growth in total viewers:", "As for the TV side, forecasting there is a mess for a bunch of different seasons. The most likely datecdotes for Q4 are The Haunting of Bly Manor, Virgin River, and The Crown.", "The Office could be a wildcard flex by Netflix as it leaves. Emily In Paris and Selena are less likely but possible.", "Since Netflix dropped Bird Box’s rating on us in Q4 of 2018—what I’m calling the “Netflix Measurement Era”—here’s my quick take on how well Netflix has added subscribers, along with some of the biggest content per quarter:", "Looking at that table and focusing on 2020, I’d spin this story:", "Netflix started off the year 2020 strong with The Witcher being one of the most popular series around the globe.", "(It was released in the last week of 2019.) Then, when people entered lockdown for Covid-19, Netflix also happened to have some of its most popular content of the year at the same time, Money Heist (3-Apr), Ozark (27-Mar) and Tiger King (20-March).", "This led to big subscriber growth after the first quarter and into the second. However, Q3 didn’t have any breakout hits to drive significant new subscriber growth.", "Indeed, this weak slate in Q3 led to the smallest U.S. growth since Q2 of 2019, the smallest global subscriber growth—1.1% —of the last two years, and missing the estimate.", "So looking at the data from today, does Q4 return to Q1 levels, or merely hold steady?", "Subscriber growth isn’t solely driven by content. The Covid-19 lockdown definitely drove growth and price increases (like this last quarter’s in the U.S.) can also slow it down.", "That could be as much the story of Q1 and Q2 as anything else. (Q2, in particular, felt light for content after March.)", "Looking at the Nielsen data and the datecdotes so far, I’d say Netflix is definitely having a better quarter than Q2 and Q3, simply because Q4 was trending upwards and Bridgerton/The Midnight Sky will likely finish very strong for Netflix.", "That said, this doesn’t look like Q1’s big subscriber growth, does it? The March slate for Netflix happened to come right when folks were binging like crazy.", "A perfect storm of good content for the right time."]}

The commentary about the Brazilian price increases slowing net additions in LatAm – which Netflix states will have a temporary effect – also raises questions.", "- Non-English language content is set to become more important.

In the case of Games, the emphasis does not seem so much on monetisation but using Games both to gain customer insights and lock in the customer.", "- However, there was another thought reading Netflix’s comments and this was how it is morphing from a streaming company into what is essentially another one of the major global content producers such as Disney.", "In fact, the areas that Netflix is targeting – children’s, movies and, to a lesser degree, games – together with its approach of looking to monetise its content in many different ways (as with its comments on the recent acquisition of much of the Roald Dahl’s rights) sound and feel very much like a Disney-esque approach.", "Which raises the question of whether Netflix is looking to turn the tables on Disney post-the latter’s move into streaming by moving more into its “natural” territory.", "- There has been some coverage of Netflix’s moves to change the way it reports its metrics, namely move to number of hours viewed than accounts that watched a programme.", "Overall, that would not seem to change much short-term and it certainly does not suggest Netflix is looking to move full throttle into TV advertising.", "Regardless, the level of transparency on Netflix’s programming is likely to remain limited, at least compared with “mainstream” TV.", "- Where Netflix does seem to be focusing its attention on is the 1 billion global Pay-TV market and much was made of this, together with the comments that Netflix only makes up 6% of US video viewing, to suggest why Netflix still has a very long runway to growth when it comes to subscriber numbers.", "Personally, I have some scepticism about this. The pool of people who have never heard of Netflix is diminishing and there are other barriers to greater penetration such that nearly a quarter of US homes do not have broadband (https://www.reviews.org/internet-service/how-many-us-households-are-without-internet-connection/).", "However, the long runway to growth story is likely to help maintain Netflix’s c. $280bn market capitalisation.", "- Nevertheless, the essential issue for Netflix still remains – not only has the streaming space become more competitive but there are questions over Netflix’s ability to raise prices significantly to boost revenues, particularly in highly competitive markets such as India.", "Kantar’s research that shows over 75% of US households also take a streaming service backs up the view that growth in North America will become harder to obtain.", "All thoughts and comments welcome.

As a result, the company was able to reduce marketing spend but still grew faster in 2020.", "This translates into lower customer acquisition costs (CAC), as is shown in Figure 3.", "As a result of these two things (and the accelerated revenue growth), Netflix was able to end 2020 with a positive FCF.", "Likely so. The great thing about subscriptions business is that, if you pull forward gain of paying subscribers (e.g. subscribers that would’ve subscribed next year or the year after under normal conditions are subscribing now), the impact on revenue, and therefore cash flow, is permanent.", "Figure 4 shows the subscriber growth rate by the years, taken from the earnings release.

It is difficult to challenge the company head on since it has such a scale advantage.", "But there are generally three strategies employed by others:", "Strategy 1: The orthogonal approach – content production fueled by other businesses", "Some of the best businesses in the world utilize an orthogonal business strategy, where they provide services for free/low-cost and monetize in other ways.", "For example: Google provides you with a free search engine, web browser, cloud documents and many other services, but makes money by monetizing your time and attention.", "In the context of streaming services, Amazon’s approach is an orthogonal one. It competes with Netflix for your viewing time, but it pays for its content investments through Prime membership, advertisements, and the sale of everyday goods through its ecommerce platforms.", "Since there are so many different ways that Amazon can make money from each Prime member, it can afford to spend as much on content to compete with Netflix even if its subscriber base is not as large.", "Strategy 2: The differentiated content approach – have unique content", "Instead of competing with Netflix on diversity of content, you can choose to compete on differentiated content.", "For example, HBO Max, a streaming service owned by Warner Media (AT&T), tries to leverage its DC Comic franchise and has decided to move Wonder Woman 1984 and its entire 2021 movie slate to the streaming service (in lieu of theatrical release).", "It’s still an open question whether this strategy will work for the company.

Disney plans to use its streaming service to acquire and have a direct relationship with the customer.", "- In October 2020, the company announced a reorganization that elevated the importance of the streaming service (Disney+) within the company, as the spearhead of user acquisition.", "- It priced Disney+ to undercut its competitors (US $6.99 per month in the US), which is cheaper than the $13.99 per month for Netflix and US $14.99 per month for HBO Max.", "- In a little over a year, Disney+ has 86.6 million subscribers, close to half that of Netflix, and four years ahead of projections.", "About 30% of that is Hotstar subscribers (a leading streaming service in India).", "Clearly, its strategy of differentiated content is working. Its growth is ahead of plans, and now it plans to slowly increase price (the first one to come in March 2021) – similar to what Netflix has done in the past.", "- Through its legacy businesses, the company monetizes its franchises via merchandise sales and theme parks", "Investors seem to like what they’re seeing from Disney. Recently its share price reached an all-time high, despite a significant portion of its business still being hampered by the global lockdown (Parks, Experiences and Products revenue is still down 61% in Q3 2020 compared to the same period in 2019).", "Disney+ is turning into a formidable challenger to Netflix. It has the business model to compete on content investments.", "It has the differentiated content that people want. And it has a significant foothold in India (through Hotstar), an important growth market for Netflix.", "Netflix likely will observe increased churn. The average US consumer typically has 3 – 4 streaming subscriptions.", "With increased competition, it is likely that Netflix has experienced higher churn (users leaving its service).", "This is especially true of its most profitable and mature market – US and Canada – where viewers have the most options.", "In fact, according to Bloomberg, for Q4 2020, ~40% of new subscribers of the various streaming services are people who have subscribed in the past.", "This means, as the streaming market becomes more mature, customer loyalty decreases. Viewers will pause subscriptions and will continue only when a show they want to watch appears.", "This makes the business even more hit-driven than before.", "Currently, both companies are valued highly by investors, depending on the lens you look through. If you compare to the overall market, the Enterprise Value/Sales (EV/S) ratios for both companies are above the market by more than 2X.

also has an arbitration center recognized nationally and it works closely with foreign invested companies, he pointed out.", "In terms of the current economic conditions, the MNCCI President said that

mining being the most coveted sector by foreign investors.", "Mr. Enkhtuvshin said that given Mongolia’s geographical conditions, China is their major foreign trade partner, with Russia being second.", "In fact, 80% of Mongolian exports are purchased by China, which are mostly mining commodities, he noted.", "The MNCCI President reported that in the import side, Mongolia imports a lot of machinery and goods from China mostly, while gasoline and energy are imported to a lesser extend from Russia.", "He further said that the mining sector is very dominant in the national economy, with more than 90% of the export as generated by the sector, including products such as cooking coal iron, copper and related commodities.", "On the agricultural side, he noted that the key product is raw

support the average household’s daily expenses.", "Thus, the government wants to increase light industries such as food processing and other businesses, that unlike mining, do not require large capital investment but require more labor, he said.", "In fact, there is an emerging demand for new labor but the supply is limited, he indicated, adding that the government in association with MNCCI

been decreasing since 2022 when it apparently reached its peak, standing now at 7.2%.", "(3) Regarding the foreign investment’s qualitative conditions, Mongolia has signed international investing frameworks, such as the convention on the establishment of investing disputes, double taxation treaties with 26 countries and investment protection and promotion agreements with 43 countries.", "(4) Certain foreign direct investment factors show positive developments such as the country’s credit rating improving to Bb minus and B plus as of June of 2023 and a lower than average taxation rate according to the World Bank.", "(5) The Investment Law was approved in 2013 and its implementation has allowed foreign companies to benefit from tax incentives under the investment law.", "He said that the minimum foreign investment required is US$100,000.", "(6) Renewable energy capacity in Mongolia could also be a very attractive investment opportunity given the geographical conditions, legal incentives and government policies promoting the establishment of green financing system to achieve net 0 carbon emission.", "(7) New foreign investment targets for Mongolia also include the development of tourism within the next 2 years, together with the establishment of foreign direct invested free zones in the frontier with China.", "(8) And for a country as large as Mongolia, agriculture is a business area with great potential that today still remains at the free range livestock growth.", "(9) There is a plan to establish 50 free-trade zones in the Chinese border that

Coffin of Over-Globalized Trade Routes", "Unfortunately, this is another massive disruption for today’s globalized supply chains, on top of two years of COVID-induced supply chain chaos, from which

The timeline to complete the relocation would be measured in years, not months.", "So, reconfiguring your supply chain is not for the fainthearted.", "But this Ukraine crisis on top of two years of COVID disruptions has surely brought many companies to a tipping point that will result in real action during the coming years on near-shoring and reshoring initiatives.", "Supply chain 2025 will undoubtedly look significantly different for many companies.", "BRINK: Is there likely to be a knock-on effect on China?", "MILLAR: Inevitably. China is the largest trading partner for both Russia and Ukraine, so those respective bilateral trade flows are going to be curtailed by the conflict.", "More importantly, China’s trade with the world will be adversely affected as established trade flows and supply chains become increasingly disrupted.", "In particular, the various Silk Road rail-freight corridors — via Belarus and Poland, or Ukraine, or St. Petersburg and Finland — will become dislocated.", "There are over seventy rail freight routes from China connecting into 174 cities across 23 countries in Europe, offering transit times of just 12-17 days, shaving several weeks off sea freight transit times.", "Many of these routes are now completely impractical and unfeasible, resulting in goods becoming stranded en-route and inventory shortages in destination markets.", "This will have the greatest impact on goods exported from factories that have relocated inland to China’s midwest, for whom rail freight is a particularly relevant alternative to sea freight.", "Chengdu in Sichuan province, for example, is almost two thousand kilometers inland from the main export container port in Shanghai.", "China will also experience knock-on effects from the broader supply chain implications, such as near-shoring initiatives and regionalization trends, which over the medium term will result in some manufacturing being relocated out of China.", "BRINK: How should companies build greater resilience into their overseas supply chains to avoid being impacted by this kind of crisis?", "MILLAR: Supply chain resilience has become the key strategic priority for this decade. Multiple initiatives need to be undertaken, including revisiting the supply base to identify sources closer-to-home and adopting wider deployment of dual- or multi-sourcing strategies, featuring multiple suppliers in multiple locations.", "Many of the finely tuned just-in-time and lean systems will be replaced or supplemented with business models incorporating buffer inventories and safety

north African countries.", "The technological advancements and reducing costs in robotics and automation will also enable some businesses to re-shore their production activities back into high labor

industry sees environmental issues as potentially having the most impact in the coming decade, according to the Global Maritime Issues Monitor 2021 survey.", "For the marine sector, key environmental risks involve the decarbonization of shipping, new environmental regulations, and the failure of climate change mitigation and adaptation.", "Each of these scored high among survey participants for their perceived impact and likelihood — and worryingly low on preparedness.", "Alongside environmental issues, industry leaders see cyberattacks, sustainability and digitization among their key concerns, according to the annual report, a joint project of the Global Maritime Forum, the International Union of Marine Insurance and Marsh Specialty.", "Interestingly, the industry gained confidence in its ability to manage pandemic risk — despite the disruptions COVID-19 has caused in supply chains, shipping and global economies.", "While the 2020 survey placed “pandemic” as the issue for which the industry was least-prepared, in 2021, it was placed among those issues for which the industry was most prepared, likely a reflection of many months of intense focus.", "For the first time across the survey’s four years, respondents ranked shipping decarbonization as the most impactful issue, followed by new environmental regulation.", "This concern, in large part, comes from increased pressure from investors, financial institutions and customers seeking to address climate change and related sustainability issues.", "The marine industry faces significant challenges in its effort to prepare for decarbonization and new environmental regulation.", "For example, the implications of decarbonization extend to fuel price increases, which the survey found to be an increasing

experts say that a potential IMO 100% by 2050 target could have nearly as much impact as a global price on GHG emissions; however, only 23% of survey respondents believe such a measure will be adopted.", "Simply reducing emissions in current vessels will not be enough to reach the goals; zero-emission ships must start entering the global fleet by 2030 and increasing their numbers significantly in the following years.", "Survey respondents also said global policies and regulations would have more impact than regional ones, but that regional and domestic ones are more likely to be implemented.", "Regulatory uncertainty — including the pricing of GHG emissions and fuel mandates — generally are seen as more likely to be used than are incentives such as fuel and vessel subsidies.", "Regarding pricing, some experts believe a key step in climate policy will be to place a price on GHG emissions; it’s also viewed as the most likely step to be implemented.", "Among survey participants, a global price was seen as the most impactful and ranked second for likelihood.", "Still, agreeing to a global price on GHG emissions is fraught with political challenges, causing some regions to consider regulating shipping while global measures are worked out.", "In July, for example, the European Commission proposed to include shipping in the EU Emissions Trading System, while the U.S. and China have raised the possibility of similar steps.", "As in most other sectors, the marine industry sees cyberattacks and data theft as more impactful and more likely in 2021.",

afford to feel “insulated” from targeted attacks.", "Upgrades involving technology and digitization are the norm across the industry, including changes to vessels, terminals, ports and other areas.", "While leading to vast improvements in shipping, these changes also open the door to increased attacks from bad actors — and increase the stakes.", "As the industry continues to digitize and upgrade technology, organizations must at the same time reinforce and upgrade their ability to withstand the inevitable attacks.", "Training employees, being vigilant regarding IT protocols, and other steps are necessary to improve cyber resilience.", "The entire ecosystem of the movement of goods is changing, and industry experts see the risks around big data and artificial intelligence as additional areas for which the marine industry needs to improve its preparedness.", "For example, AI’s role in logistics operations is increasing, while autonomous driving systems are set to be ubiquitous in all means of transportation, including shipping.", "For the marine sector, impacts will include the interoperability of cargo booking and forwarding systems, electronic bills of lading, and more.", "Not only are such developments rife with cyber risks, they are shifting liability and leading to the need to purchase new and/or expanded insurance programs that align with new laws.", "The marine industry continues to adjust to a number of issues brought on or exacerbated by COVID-19, including shipping delays and a crew-change crisis.", "Looking beyond these immediate concerns, the industry

It’s certainly a cause of price volatility and may be a cause of high prices. There is an example in the last supercycle when the high price of steel definitely slowed down the growth of wind power because wind turbines use a lot of steel, and the high price of steel actually resulted in wind turbines becoming more expensive over a number of years, rather than cheaper.", "At that point, people were wondering whether that was going to choke off the explosion in renewables.", "We could see exactly the same with batteries and electric vehicles. There’s a wide range of battery technologies being developed, but obviously lithium is key to the current generation of batteries.", "And if all the countries go for building electric vehicles and buying electric vehicles that say they’re going to, lithium is going to have to increase in supply by a very large margin.", "If we want to recycle more products, it will be more economical if modules within products are usable — that is an absolutely core agenda item as part of addressing these materials issues in the future.", "In my view, there’s enough lithium in the earth’s crust, but it takes a lot of investment to get it out.", "It’s sometimes in quite inhospitable places, with governments that are a bit suspicious of miners, so there could be challenges along those lines.", "BRINK: What is the solution to that — would a greater emphasis on recycling and the circular economy help to lessen the impact of this supercycle?", "EKINS: Yes, very much. In fact, I would say that it’s precisely these kinds of pressures that have contributed to the new policy interest in circular-economy thinking, in recycling, remanufacturing, refurbishing, trying to ensure that we get more than one lifecycle out of the metals and commodities that we dig out of the ground and that they stay in circulation for longer than they currently do.", "People are talking about the importance of “urban mining,” which means identifying where these metals are in use and ensuring they don’t end up in landfill tips — that they are actually mined locally, through reusing and repurposing the various materials that we’re talking about.", "There are also people who talk about going into landfill tips and mining the materials in there, because very often the materials in landfill tips are at a higher concentration than they are in the ores from which they were originally produced.", "So I think we’re going to see a lot of that; whether that gets to a scale that it can really mitigate the sorts of pressures from increased demand and problems in accessing new supply will remain to be seen.", "One important area at the moment is the design of products; most products are designed without any thought of their end-of-life fate.", "If we want to recycle more products, it will be more economical if modules within products are usable.", "You could take out the modules that you’re interested in if the products have been put together in a way with recycling or later reuse in mind.", "That is an absolutely core agenda item as part of addressing these materials issues in the future.", "BRINK: What about the impact on inflation. Some investors are buying up commodities as a hedge against inflation.", "But could a rise in commodity prices actually trigger inflation?", "EKINS: In the short term, very possibly, because when demand goes up faster than the investment can go in to meet it with new supply, prices go up.", "And that’s a pretty well-established pattern. History has shown us that investment and new supply then tends to catch up with that.", "However, technological development tends to moderate prices in the medium- and long-term, and I see no reason why that won’t continue.", "So I’m a little skeptical when people say that we’re going to experience a kind of supercycle where the price goes up and up and up and becomes a real inflationary problem.", "We have seen this in oil and gas, where every now and again, there is a price spike that feeds inflation figures.", "But what that has also done in the case of oil and gas is stimulate new technologies. So the whole U.S. shale oil and gas revolution of the last 20 years was, in a sense, a result of the supercycle in those prices from about 2000.", "I see no reason for thinking that that wouldn’t happen with regard to other commodities.

In both, we found that working remotely improved worker productivity.", "First, we looked at workers who started working in a call center and then transitioned to working remotely before the pandemic.", "For those workers, we found a pretty sharp increase in their productivity following that transition — the calls they took per hour rose by about 8% when they went from the office to working at home.", "A Harvard University report found that in this remote work setting, people with childcare responsibilities are more productive than those without those responsibilities — both before and after the pandemic.", "Second, we looked at what happened when the pandemic forced all the onsite workers at the same retailer to work remotely.", "Then, we compared the productivity of newly remote workers, who were no longer able to go into the office due to the pandemic, to the productivity change of their already remote working peers.", "The productivity of newly remote workers rose relative to their already remote peers. So even if they didn’t volunteer to be remote, they still became more productive when working from home.", "In both cases for a given worker, transitioning from onsite work to remote work led to about an 8% increase in productivity.", "Our explanation for this increase in productivity is that it likely stems from a reduction in distractions.", "So you might be spending less time interacting with your coworkers.

One is: Are people reaching their full potential of their personal productivity?", "And the other is: How productive are the people who are taking a particular job? When we think about the extent to which people are reaching their personal potential, it looks like remote work is helping people.", "However, the people who were hired for remote jobs turned out to be relatively less productive than the people hired initially into onsite jobs and then transferred to remote working.", "So, from the firm’s perspective, when they think about which work arrangement is going to be more productive, they also need to also think about what types of workers are going to take these two types of jobs.", "Some workers who would prefer to work remotely, and would be more productive at home, still might decide to go into the office because they don’t want to be seen as less productive.", "When we get out of the pandemic, a company might prefer to hire new workers into an office role — even though that worker might be more productive being remote — just because the type of worker who is willing to go into the office may on average be more productive.", "In other words, the willingness to go into the office may reveal some sort of dedication to the job that can be divorced from the effect of being in an office on someone’s productivity.", "BRINK: One of the findings showed a positive correlation with childcare responsibility. Is that correct?", "HARRINGTON: Yes, we found that in this setting, people with childcare responsibilities were more productive than those without those responsibilities — both before and after the pandemic.", "The gap became marginally larger after the pandemic.", "I think one possible explanation for that finding is that this is a relatively low wage job. Therefore, I think choosing this role because of constraints at home might be a better signal about a worker than choosing this job without those constraints.", "BRINK: This research was conducted with call center workers, which are relatively low wage jobs. Do you think these findings have equal application in other higher paid or executive level jobs?", "HARRINGTON: I think the benefits of being remote in reducing distractions are likely to be pretty generalizable.", "In lots of jobs, you’re going to be benefited by having fewer distractions.", "But in those other jobs, these benefits need to be weighed against the potential costs of remote work, making coordination more difficult.", "You might also lose some of those productive water cooler chats that you would likely have in the office.", "Further, in other occupations, the question of who takes a remote versus onsite job might be an even bigger concern.", "When productivity is harder to assess, workers who are less productive may have a more direct incentive to be remote to hide their lower productivity from their manager.", "When firms think about what to do after the pandemic, there may be incentives for them to return to the office because they prefer to hire workers who want to go to the office rather than work remotely.", "That doesn’t mean going back to the office is the socially optimal outcome. Using remote versus onsite work to sort workers into different types can lead to a market failure.", "Some workers who would prefer to work remotely, and would be more productive at home, still might decide to go into the office because they don’t want to be seen as less productive.", "The market doesn’t necessarily get to the best solution because the incentives of individual firms don’t necessarily align with maximizing total output.", "Privately, each firm might be worried about the types of workers it will hire into remote jobs. But, in the aggregate, productivity might rise if more jobs were remote.", "Thus, one implication of our findings is that moves by governments and other entities to try to support remote work may improve efficiency.", "Further, since workers with childcare responsibilities have an added interest in working at home, such policies may also improve economic equity.", "PhD Candidate in Harvard University’s Department of Economics", "Emma Harrington is a labor economist studying the changing nature of work.

Wood is the chair of London Futurists and the principal of Delta Wisdom, an independent futurist consultancy.", "BRINK began by asking him what the purpose of a more comprehensive risk management system might be.", "A shipment of 10 million protective face masks and other protective medical gear to fight against COVID-19 in Germany.", "The likelihood and variety of risk overall is higher than in the past.", "WOOD: One reason for a more comprehensive risk system is that you often need to amalgamate insights from multiple perspectives to really appreciate the nature of the challenges and opportunities ahead.", "If you look at the lead-up to the 9/11 bombings, it turned out there was ample evidence and intelligence that had been seen by individual groups, but because there was insufficient sharing of information between the different agencies and insufficient imagination as to what the al-Qaida terrorists might be doing, nobody managed to join the dots in a satisfactory way beforehand.", "WOOD: We must be more transparent and open in pooling our insights, because often the biggest possibilities emerge not just when one trend moves forward, but when several trends collide or converge in ways that individual observers may not have anticipated.", "BRINK: To do this well would obviously involve governments cooperating with each other and sharing knowledge and information.", "How do you foresee that happening in an age when governments seem increasingly nationalist and there is less and less global cooperation?", "WOOD: There are worrying trends toward populism, but at the same time, there are also trends that encourage countries to cooperate, even in the countries where the leaders might be hostile to each other — especially if they can be persuaded of the true scale of the risks that are confronting them.", "A good example was what happened in the 1980s, between former presidents Ronald Reagan and Mikhail Gorbachev.", "When Ronald Reagan became president, he spoke of the Soviet Union as the evil empire. When Mikhail Gorbachev took power in the Soviet Union, the Soviet Union regarded the West with great hostility.", "But something changed that enabled them to work toward a significant reduction in nuclear weapons. And that was the new understanding that a nuclear attack would not just destroy some cities, but that the dust created by these explosions would go high into the stratosphere and could block out the sun’s light, creating a nuclear winter that would impact both sides, killing many more people than previously expected.", "WOOD: There were other factors, of course, like the personal chemistry between President Gorbachev and President Reagan, but this is a model of what is needed: clear, credible discussions of huge risks that will cause even nationalist populist leaders to start reconsidering their positions.", "We need global leaders and budget holders to wake up to the responsibility that there are greater numbers of large risks out there than ever before.", "BRINK: What role would you imagine the United Nations would have in this? After all, the U.N. is a risk management body that was created after the Second World War.", "WOOD: The U.N. was set up with the right vision and purpose for its time, but like many other organizations, it has become fossilized and is the victim of inertia.", "It needs to be regenerated or rejuvenated by one means or another.", "We need global leaders and budget holders to wake up to the responsibility that there are greater numbers of large risks out there than ever before.", "Large risks are changing from matters of occasional concern to matters of constant concern. Leaders need to understand that, as technology becomes more advanced — not just artificial intelligence, but also biotech, cogno-tech, robotics and nanotech — it opens huge new risks as well as huge, new opportunities.", "And so the likelihood and variety of risk overall is higher than in the past, which means it’s even more important that enough public mindshare is given to this task of understanding them.", "BRINK: You talk about the psychology of denial, which is a common human trait in risk management. You can’t imagine something like COVID-19 until it’s happened.", "Are there ways that you can mitigate against that in thinking about future risk?", "WOOD: We need to be immersed in discussions of credible scenarios for what might and might not happen, rather than just Hollywood films.", "We need to become much more literate at understanding the risks of outbreaks of infectious diseases, as well as the other risks of contagion, whether it’s financial contagion or malware contagion, or fake news contagion and so on.", "And we need to understand things more probabilistically. Probability is a difficult concept, but we need to help people understand it, so when things like bird flu or SARS or MERS happen, the public appreciates that things could well have turned out very differently.", "In each case, it was either because the diseases weren’t sufficiently infectious enough to spread easily from human to human, or because of aggressive action that various governments took that prevented these earlier cases of infection from causing wider damage.", "Science isn’t a fixed, black-and-white understanding. Science reevaluates itself as it gains better insights.", "We need to be prepared to plug that probabilistic understanding into our actions. I wish that children at school learned more about risk planning and scenarios.", "We should all become more competent talking about this.

As corporations build out the interoperability of their corporate systems with personal technology — via either increased compatibility with personal mobile devices or other methods of accessing company databases through home computing networks — the probability of inadvertently introducing vulnerabilities into corporate systems increases.", "The ability to rapidly identify vulnerabilities and detect breaches will become paramount to the successful operation of any company.", "The longer this remote work period persists, the more sophisticated and targeted the actions of criminals and

extended periods of time.", "Institutions also need to assess their cybersecurity insurance policies to ensure adequate coverage, as well as seek to mitigate their third-party and supply-chain vendor risks.", "Increased use of remote work technologies and outside support systems will also require corporations to revisit and revise their risk management programs for supply chains.", "As the web of contact with outside systems and vendors grows, existing cybersecurity procedures may also need to be overhauled.", "These may include incident response plans, remote work and employee privacy policies, data privacy and security training materials, bring-your-own-device (BYOD) rules, data/record retention schedules, information security and acceptable use policies and email and messaging

intensive contingency planning and aggressive outreach to employees, vendors, suppliers and stakeholders is recommended.", "Employees who have been working from home need to make their shared platforms, devices and databases less vulnerable to attack.", "It’s not just the organization’s cybersecurity that’s at risk, but the privacy interests of the individual at stake in maintaining their personal and financial security from criminals and other bad actors.", "Internal messaging related to cybersecurity must be clear, compelling and consistent — whether in writing, in person, online, in a virtual training session or in a video.", "After employees receive training, each should be required to pass a test to ensure they understand their new cybersecurity responsibilities.", "An ongoing

measures per month, a number which is significantly higher than the three measures recorded during the previous review period.", "The Global Chamber Platform therefore calls on the G20 economies ahead of their November Summit in Buenos Aires, to reverse that worrying trend without delay by reducing considerably the imposition of new trade restrictive measures, in order to bring back predictability

Because copyright deals are country-specific, Netflix might pay the rights for one or several countries, but not others, to save costs.", "This goes against Netflix’s overall approach of offering as much content as possible to everyone. Yet, cost does need to be considered (they are a business, after all).", "Avoiding country-specific copyright laws is a prominent reason compelling Netflix to invest heavily in producing its own content.", "This will allow them to show viewers in all countries new material without paying copyright on a per-country basis.", "As an app founder seeking inspiration from established brands, Netflix offers several valuable takeaway messages:", "Formulate your strategy around solving a problem. Doing this sets your audience at the core of your business and ensures your company always serves your customers.", "Use data to implement your strategy. The power of user data can not be understated in our digital age.", "Even if you’re not using data to assess your audience, your most successful competitors will be. Collect audience data and use it to your advantage.", "Stay ahead of the game. This is easier said than done, but doing something new sets you apart.", "Be willing to take risks and go against the grain.

Generally speaking, yes we can. As I have shared many times before, strength begets strength.", "In particular, the behavior we call “momentum” has one of the most powerful evidentiary backings. A study out of Wharton aptly named “the longest backtest ever done,” looked at 212 years of market data and found that momentum has always been there.", "And it makes sense for two reasons; one, because humans tend to chase, to put it simply, we tend to follow the leaders, in stocks and in life, and two, information takes time to disseminate.", "That is, good news and growing earnings take time to absorb into the market, as people thoughtfully process and act on their decisions.", "All that said, the real issue is identifying when this changes.

So knowing how you think, this would suggest that the long term trend is cracking at the seams?", "Himelsein: Yes, exactly. In general terms, it has spent the entire 2019 in a wide sideways range. The broader S&P 500 has been on fire, as has its more closely connected index, the Nasdaq 100, but Netflix has not.", "It’s lagging on all fronts, demonstrating behavior that is distinctly different from a strong trend leader, aka cracking at the seams.", "And then it cracked. On Thursday of last week, it disappoints on earnings, and gaps down 10%-ish, and sells off even further the very next day to reach about 12.5% off.", "But the concern goes further than that because we are now below the entirety of this year’s sideways movement, breaking even the low that was the first stopping point of its January of 2019 rally (with the market).", "Kam: By your standards of analysis, that seems doubly problematic! Are you, therefore, suggesting that any holder get out now, and no buying the dip at this point?", "Himelsein: High level, Netflix is breaking a powerful long term trend. This can be ugly and can last a while.", "From my perspective, I am therefore not touching Netflix until I see a healthy stop to the pain and healthy recovery.", "That said, and to be fair, Netflix may be fine in the long run. Based on my assessment, Netflix could be out of favor for months, or perhaps the rest of the year or even longer.", "The point is that how long it is “out of favor” and the related deterioration period is a complete unknown.", "It is reasonable to be a fan of the long term viability of the business model and believe that it will revert to its historic trend at some point.", "If investors can live with gyrations and have no need for liquidity, there is nothing wrong with holding the stock until it turns around.", "But that’s not what I do. I would rather find better places to deploy that capital. I have learned from decades of investing that what matters is tomorrow.", "We can only pay our bills with money in the bank, not with gains from next year’s turn around.", "My Take: Wayne has an 18+ year track record delivering 11.79% a year while the S&P 500 returned just 5.93% for the same period.", "Few managers have outperformed the market for as long and by as wide a margin.", "If you are thinking about selling Netflix and want some ideas about where to invest the proceeds, click here to learn more about Wayne, the stocks he has been buying recently, and sign up to be notified when he updates his views."]}

I see “compounder” as who persistently create value (not monetary value alone) for all stakeholders across the value chain, and “mindful” is a generalization of many traits I look for Tao & Commander factor, e.g. mission driven, purposeful, rationality, deep thinking & high awareness.", "(see more in my investment process post[1]).

Below I draw the time series of valuation (TTM P/S ratio), and annualized compounding return to date (i.e. if holding form that point of time to 9/30/2020).", "I excluded annualized return for recent 2 years since they are not representative for the short history.", "One clear lesson to be learn here is that market has been far from efficient in evaluating the intrinsic value of these companies.", "Taking Amazon for example, the worst time to buy it was in January 2000 when it was priced at 17 P/S ratio, but you would still achieve 20+% annual compounding return if you hold till now.", "Buying it any other time later than 2004 and hold it till now would give well above 30% annual return!", "Obviously, valuation still matters, but the worst scenario of 20% is far cry from an efficient market return over 20 years.", "So, the market must have missed something! Luckily, all three companies have long history for me to study patterns that can help identify value earlier.", "The first important pattern is that none of them relied on a single product/service to achieve the substantial value compounding.", "As old businesses mature, all these companies in their lives experienced some pivotal “quantum leaps” expanding to new products/services, which ultimately contribute heavily to its long-term value but was not fully appreciated by the time.", "With few exceptions, the leaders later would admit that the leap was not by design, or at least that they didn’t foresee the full potential.", "For example, Netflix had two major pivots from DVD renting, to streaming & to original content.

For example, Nadella decided to write off $7.6 billion from Nokia purchase first year in 2015 and to terminate its Windows division, which was split into Azure & Office divisions in 2016.", "Additionally, during the agonizing Windows to Azure reorganization (which one executive called “pulling fingernails”), Nadella showed his exceptional ability to make aggressive changes with little drama.", "Netflix’s Reed Hastings, a half-mentor of Nadella (as board of Microsoft), is a hallmark of such decision-making ability[4].", "Although the decision of pivoting to streaming & original content are both monumental, I think the most radical & prescient decision may be the one he made in earlier year to call off its streaming hardware right before its launch.", "I was December 2007 and Netflix has been exploring variety of new business models as its legacy DVD renting line matures.", "A team of about 20 had been working around the clock for years on a project coded “Griffin”.

Maybe Alan, first, it took a while to get the YouTube deal done, so congratulations on that. I was just wondering if you could speak to why the digital distributors have taken a little longer to come on board with the networks.", "Is this just them being a little slower to aggregate content, particularly Spanish-language content?

And we're finally able to break through with a lot -- it took a while, got through to YouTube TV, and we think this should hopefully open the floodgates with all the other virtual MVPDs so that they all similarly focus and realize opportunity with the Hispanic market.", "Yeah. And then it seems like the ad market in Puerto Rico is as strong as it's been since I followed the Company.", "Do you feel like we're entering a period where this is more structural and there's some legs to it? Or should we think about this as a little more cyclical, like maybe has a couple of quarters left before it goes back to more of a steady state, which was unfortunately historically sort of a state of volatility?", "Alan J. Sokol -- President and Chief Executive Officer", "I think we feel as good about the Puerto Rico economy as we have felt since we acquired WAPA in 2007.", "And I think, to a large extent, this is structural and sustainable, given the impending major infrastructure projects that will start occurring in Puerto Rico over the next 12 months.", "We think that will have long-term positive impacts for the island.", "The economy is healthy, unemployment is down, all the metrics are very positive, so we feel very good about it.", "On the long run though, the health of Puerto Rico will depend on an efficient government and official way of operating the island in a way that has not been done before, but we feel good about where things are right now.", "And then could you talk about the content pipeline that's upcoming at Pantaya a little bit? There is a lot of content it seems like coming in the back half of the year, from sports to movies, to lots of streaming services, sort of making up for stuff that was deferred during the pandemic.", "So how do you feel about kind of gross ads and churn and what that pipeline looks like for the back half of the year?", "Alan J. Sokol -- President and Chief Executive Officer", "Well, we're really optimistic, Steve. I mean, we are starting to ramp-up production on Pantaya and acquisitions.", "We have a unique set of relationships with the top producers and distributors in Latin America, which would be impossible to replicate.", "We have unique knowledge and experience of the Hispanic market, and the depth of content as well as our strategic advantages we use in the Hemisphere assets to help promote and otherwise drive Pantaya's growth.", "So that -- we feel great about the confluence of those different facts that will help drive accelerated growth at Pantaya.", "And we also just swim in a different lane. Nobody has the singular focus on Spanish-language premium content that we do, and nobody has the depth of content that we do in the market.", "And then lastly, I got to throw this one out. A couple of weeks ago, press reported that you might be exploring a sale of the company.", "I was wondering if you could make any commentary around that or talk about your view on what the backdrop is for industry consolidation at the moment.", "Alan J. Sokol -- President and Chief Executive Officer", "Well, on the first question, Steve, we don't comment on market rumors or speculation. And in terms of consolidation, I think it's -- obviously, we've seen consolidation.", "We feel very good about where we are as an independent company. Although we're not a large company within our space, we are a major company and we feel very good about our leverage and our ability to continue to grow in this environment.", "Your next question comes from the line of Curry Baker with Guggenheim Securities.", "Curry Baker -- Guggenheim Securities, Inc. -- Analyst", "Hey. Good morning, guys. I was wondering if you could maybe to start out with, could you provide a little more color just how the advertising market for your U.S. cable networks is pacing", "and then maybe some color as well just on audience performance and metrics there?", "Alan J. Sokol -- President and Chief Executive Officer", "Sure. We had a good quarter in the U.S. We feel very good about our U.S. business. Yeah, our numbers were up significantly over 2020 and were up over 2019 as well.", "And I think for both Puerto Rico and the U.S. being up over 2019 puts us in a somewhat unique position vis-a-vis our peer group of media companies, all of which were, to my knowledge, below their 2019 levels.", "Curry Baker -- Guggenheim Securities, Inc. -- Analyst", "Just the ratings and audience metrics, any additional color you could share there?", "Alan J. Sokol -- President and Chief Executive Officer", "No, we're not -- our networks are not Nielsen rated. We have ComScore ratings, and they provide limited amounts of insight into ratings.", "But as I noted, all four of our -- all four of our rated networks are top 15. Pantaya is the number two network.", "So we feel great about our leadership position in the spaces that we occupy.", "Curry Baker -- Guggenheim Securities, Inc. -- Analyst", "Okay. And then on the subscriber front at the U.S. cable networks, can you give us any indication of what you're seeing kind of trends sequentially getting better, just any incremental color there?", "Alan J. Sokol -- President and Chief Executive Officer", "Yeah. Listen, I think our second quarter results this year were better than they were a year ago in terms of subscriber losses.", "So that's a positive. I think second quarter tends to be a difficult quarter for the industry. And we're also feeling great that our recent launches, expansions of coverage and continued conversations about future launches will go a long way toward mitigating any future organic subscriber declines.", "Curry Baker -- Guggenheim Securities, Inc. -- Analyst", "Okay. And then is there any way you guys can help us think about kind of the path or metrics to profitability at Pantaya, kind of what that roadmap looks like at a high level?", "Alan J. Sokol -- President and Chief Executive Officer", "Yeah. I think, look, what I can say is that at our stated goal of 2.5 million to 3 million subscribers by 2025, we will be very profitable.", "Our model is different than that of the big channel market guys who are not spending millions of dollars an hour on programming.", "As I said before, our entire programming and production budget is a couple of episodes of The Mandalorian.", "So we produce at a much lower price point -- at a much more cost-effective price point. And our audience doesn't come to us to watch massive special effects, they come to us to watch content that is hopefully relevant, they can't find anywhere else, that speaks to them, that it's of a premium nature that you can't find on broadcast television.", "Curry Baker -- Guggenheim Securities, Inc. -- Analyst", "Alan J. Sokol -- President and Chief Executive Officer", "Thank you. I will now turn the call back over to Mr. Alan Sokol for closing remarks.", "Alan J. Sokol -- President and Chief Executive Officer", "Nothing further. I appreciate everybody's attendance, and have a good day.", "Alan J.

If they can double that over the next ten years, and they can also double what they charge, they will have 250 million subs paying $20 per month.", "Which is (pause for jet-lagged mental calculation) $5 billion in revenues. Each month. Or $60 billion per year.”", "There was a slightly stunned silence in the room. I’ll explain why in a minute, but I want to point out that I am not making an actual prediction on Netflix here.", "This is just kind of ‘back of the napkin’ thinking about what the media industry might look like ten years from now.", "I find this a useful exercise for a lot of strategy stuff.", "According to the Netflix results for Q1 2018, total global subs were 125.00 million, although only 118.90 million are paying customers, with the balance on the free month trial.", "The company is adding about 7.5 million subscribers per quarter at this time (8.33 million in Q4/17, 7.41 million in Q1/18, and is forecasting 6.20 million for Q2/18, although they have been beating their forecasts most quarters.)", "Most of those are converting to paying subscribers in the following quarter.", "Therefore Netflix is at a run rate of adding about 30 million subs per year. At that rate, they would have about 425 million paying subs by 2028, not 250 million.", "My assumption is intentionally conservative. Possibly MUCH too conservative, but I’ll stick with it for now.", "In the quarter, the company had $3.602 billion in streaming revenues from 118.90 million paying subscribers, so quarterly revenues of $30.29 per sub per quarter, or $10.10 monthly.", "In the US, they have raised prices 12% over the last year, with no slowdown in growth or customers quitting over the increase.", "Internationally, ignoring currency swings, monthly revenues per subscriber increased 13%.", "At a rate of 12-13% annual price increases, Netflix would cost more than $32 per month by 2028. That feels too high, so I will stick with my assumption above, that they double the monthly price over the next decade to about $20, which equates to an annual increase of 7.1% compounded.", "In some ways it doesn’t. If Netflix reaches 250 million subs in 2028, that is a lot more than today…but still small compared to traditional TV viewers worldwide, which were about 1.6 billion TV households globally in 2016, projected to grow to 1.68B by 2021, so likely 1.8B by 2028.", "The amount of time each subscriber spends watching Netflix seems to have plateaued or is even declining.", "Global TV revenues are around $380 billion in 2018 ($200B in pay TV revenues and $180B in advertising) so although a hypothetical 2028 Netflix top line of $60B is big for a single company, it is still small in the context of the overall industry.", "Although TV revenues globally are not growing as fast as Netflix, neither are they shrinking: estimates for the industry worldwide in 2021 suggest it will be roughly flat, or even up slightly, and I assume about the same for 2028.", "Whether we look at subscribers, time spent, or even dollars, there seems to be ample room for Netflix to coexist with the traditional TV industry.", "Netflix will spend about $8 billion on content in 2018. Compared to 2017 revenues of $11.243 billion, that seems really high: no media company can spend over 70% of revenues on content!", "As a comparison, Time Warner also spends about $8B on non-sports content, but has revenues of over $30B.", "“Netflix sure spends a lot. It is driving up the price of content for all of us. Thank God they can’t spend any more than they already do.", "Without getting into an actual forecast of what current year revenues will be (that comes too close to the kind of company-specific opining I won’t do), my napkin math suggests that they could have 2028 revenues of $60B or so.", "I don’t think they will be spending 70% of those conjectured revenues on content. But 50% is plausible.", "That Netflix is close to some sort of “ceiling” on content spending at $8 billion per year looks unsupportable in this scenario.", "I don’t see spending growing unreasonably, but could they be spending over $30 billion by 2028?", "Yes. And that is about as much as NBCU, Fox, Time Warner and Disney spent on non-sports content last year.", "As always, some disclosures. None of the numbers above are official from my day job. This isn’t a prediction, merely a thought exercise to answer the question of “where does Netflix go from here?”", "Most importantly, although I am a former portfolio manager, none of this should be used as investment advice, or constitutes an opinion of NFLX share price or valuation.", "That isn’t just boilerplate disclaimer: the stock is already highly valued, and I literally have NO OPINION at all on whether the price goes up or down.", "Neither I nor my wife owns any shares or interest in NFLX.", "People-led transformation for enterprises of all sizes. #productivity #resilience #sustainability", "6yI think as more screens are added per person, the uptake could surge in coming years. They have the killer tech plus content advantage that's unstoppable right now.", "So if I start consuming stuff I like on different screens at different time, they could expect a rise of 25% on charges over the next few years.", "It depends on the speed with which they can produce more niche content for the hundreds of personas they know they cater right now.", "Just wondering if smart distribution of content is an interesting play in the markets they are excelling right now, meaning are there indicators of creating content for more screen types (and bite size)?", "6yThis kind of projective thinking is important and useful. I'd argue that your upper subscriber figures are a stretch - as Netflix demonstrates the potential of the market, it will face more competition and more difficulty in gaining additional subscribers - but your more conservative estimate could be reasonable.", "I guess what Netflix is really doing is making content global and benefiting from those economies of scale.", "Netflix makes a show, and can then show it in every single market for no additional cost. Compare that to a Showtime, for example, which has immediate access to US subscribers, but then has to act through local distributors (Sky, Star, etc) to reach a wider audience, with a commensurate loss in revenue.", "What it hasn't shown is that it can marshall that revenue well. On $11.6bn of revenue last year, it turned a profit of $200m - it's a start, but it needs to become much better at being a business, not just a content factory."]}

Therefore, the cord-cutting trend is secondary for Roku, whereas Pay TV ad budgets' migration is the primary trend.", "There are other reasons that I like Roku, such as owning the whole stack including the operating system, the management, it’s global opportunity, the agnosticism, etcetera– which I have covered in previous analysis.", "However, I try to keep things simple when discussing my thesis, and the migration of Pay TV ad budgets combined with Roku’s first-party data is why this stock has its best years ahead.", "The information contained herein are opinions and not financial advice.

growth rates indicate that the global population will exceed 8 billion by mid-2023.", "These numbers provide some great context, but what does the latest data tell us about how people’s digital behaviours are evolving?", "Let’s dig deeper into this quarter’s report to learn more.", "Social media users reach another impressive milestone", "The top story in this quarter’s report is that there are now more than 4½ billion social media users around the world.", "That figure is more than 400 million higher than it was this time last year, equating to year-on-year growth of almost 10 percent.", "For context, it was only this time last year – in our Digital 2020 October Global Statshot Report – that we reported social media users had passed the 4 billion mark.", "Social media user numbers are still growing steadily too, with an average of 13 new users starting to use social media for the first time every single second.", "User growth has slowed slightly compared to the annual growth figures we reported in our April and July Statshot reports, but the latest figure is still higher than the growth rate we reported in our last pre-COVID report in January 2020.", "It’s also worth stressing that we’ve been anticipating ‘less rapid’ growth for some time now, and it’s actually taken a couple of quarters longer than we expected for growth rates to return towards their pre-COVID pace.", "However, even at this ‘slower’ pace of growth, current trends suggest that social media users will still pass the equivalent of 60 percent of the world’s total population some time in the first half of 2022.", "China is now home to more than 1 billion internet users", "The latest report from CNNIC reveals that over 1 billion people in China now use the internet, accounting for more than 1 in 5 of the world’s total internet user base.", "More than 70 million people in China started using the internet over the past year, resulting in year-on-year growth of 7½ percent – well ahead of the global average growth rate of 4.8 percent.", "This figure means that China accounted for almost one-third of the 222 million new users we’ve added to our global user total since this time last year.", "Roughly 70 percent of China’s total population is now online – up from 65 percent this time last year – while 2 new users join their ranks every second.", "However, there’s still plenty more room for growth, with CNNIC’s data indicating that more than 400 million people across the country are yet to come online.", "TikTok announced that it had passed the 1 billion monthly active user figure at the end of September 2021, making it just the seventh social media platform to join the exclusive billion-user club.", "It’s taken TikTok just 5 years to reach this milestone, and arguably even less time than that if we consider that the platform only really started to gain global momentum after it merged with Musical.ly in August 2018.", "What’s more, TikTok has reached this impressive figure despite being still blocked in India – a country which is home to more than 650 million internet users, or roughly 15 percent of the global internet population.", "TikTok’s user growth shows few signs of slowing either, with App Annie reporting that the platform continued to top global download rankings for non-game apps between July and September this year.", "It took considerably less time for TikTok to reach 1 billion active users than it took Facebook, but it’s worth highlighting that when Facebook passed the billion-user milestone in October 2012, Facebook reached roughly 40 percent of all the world’s social media users.", "For a platform to reach that same share of social media users today, it would need to attract roughly 2 billion monthly active users.", "Regardless of comparative growth rates however, there’s no denying that 1 billion active users is enough to make any marketer sit up and take notice.", "But just how compelling is the TikTok marketing opportunity?", "Well, the good news is that we’re (finally!) able to report detailed figures for TikTok advertising reach around the world in this quarter’s report.", "Just before we dig into the detailed stats for TikTok’s advertising audience, please take careful note of the following:", "The potential advertising reach figures we’ve included in this quarter’s reports come from TikTok’s self-service advertising tools.", "These tools publish potential reach as a range (e.g. 18,000-20,000), and we use the midpoint of that range (e.g. 19,000) for our published reach figure.", "TikTok’s self-service advertising tools only publish audience reach data for users aged 18 and above, even though the same tools allow advertisers to target adverts to users aged 13 and above.", "As a result, the figures that Bytedance reports in these tools may be significantly lower than TikTok’s total active user base, as well as its total potential advertising reach.", "The company’s tools only publish potential reach data for a selection of countries, and as a result, figures published in these tools may not reflect the platform’s total global advertising audience.", "In particular, note that TikTok’s self-service advertising tools do not report data for Douyin in China, which ByteDance operates as a separate platform.", "Comparisons to population (e.g. percentage of population aged 18 and above) are based on the latest population data from the United Nations and the US Census Bureau (note that the US Census Bureau publishes population data for a wide variety of countries, not just the United States).", "However, as is the case for all social media platforms, age-related figures may be skewed by users misrepresenting their age on TikTok.", "With those caveats in mind, ByteDance’s latest numbers indicate that marketers can now reach 825 million users aged 18 and above around the world via ads on TikTok.", "For context, those figures suggest that TikTok ads now enable marketers to reach:", "10 percent of the world’s total population, regardless of age or location", "15 percent of everybody aged 18 and above, regardless of location", "24 percent of everybody aged 18 and above outside of China (which has a separate app) and India (where TikTok is currently unavailable)", "However, as we see in the data for all other platforms, TikTok’s reach varies considerably by geography and by demographic.", "For example, the company’s own data indicates that 56.1 percent of the worldwide TikTok ad audience is female.", "Interestingly, this represents a ‘flip’ of Facebook’s gender ratio, where male users account for 56.5 percent of the global advertising audience.", "However, it’s worth highlighting that Facebook’s gender ratio is somewhat skewed by its audience demographics in India, where men account for more than 75 percent of the platform’s 350 million monthly active users.", "Note: TikTok doesn’t report audience data for genders other than ‘female’ or ‘male’, which is why we’re only able to report binary gender splits.", "As noted above, ByteDance’s tools only report data for TikTok users aged 18 and above, so we’re currently unable to report potential advertising reach for users between the ages of 13 and 17.", "However, the available data clearly supports the hypothesis that TikTok is particularly popular amongst younger users.", "Specifically, users aged 18 to 24 account for roughly 45 percent of TikTok’s global ad reach amongst users aged 18 and above.", "What’s more, women in this age group account for roughly a quarter of the platform’s total advertising audience aged 18 and above.", "For context, that means women aged 18 to 24 account for a greater share of TikTok’s advertising audience than users of any gender aged 35 and above do.", "Note: TikTok’s tools report a total reach figure for each age group which is slightly higher than the sum of the individual figures it reports for female and male users in each respective age group, which is why figures do not sum to 100 percent.", "The United States is home to TikTok’s largest advertising audience, with the latest data showing that TikTok ads now reach more than 120 million US users aged 18 and above.", "For reference, that’s just 20 percent lower than the 150 million American users aged 18 and above that marketers can reach using ads on Instagram.", "It’s also interesting to note that TikTok’s US ad reach figure is equal to 46.5 percent of the total US population in the same age range, although younger users misrepresenting their age may somewhat skew this ratio.", "Indonesia claims second place in TikTok’s ad reach ranking, with the company’s tools reporting potential reach of more than 87.5 million Indonesian users aged 18 and above.", "Brazil comes in third, with more than 72 million users in the same age group.", "However, when we look at TikTok’s reach compared to local populations, we start to uncover some more interesting findings.", "For example, TikTok appears to be particularly popular in the Middle East.", "The number of TikTok users in Saudi Arabia is equal to nearly 80 percent of the country’s total population aged 18 and above, and the platform’s local user base is already significantly larger than that of either Facebook or Instagram.", "TikTok has also developed a strong user base in Kuwait and the UAE, where the platform’s ad products offer potential reach equivalent to more than two-thirds of all adults aged 18 and above.", "The platform is also very popular across South-East Asia, with TikTok’s ad reach figures equal to more than 6 in 10 adults aged 18 and above in Thailand and Cambodia, and more than half of that age group in Vietnam and Malaysia.", "So, with a large audience that’s already spread throughout the world, TikTok offers plenty for marketers to get excited about.", "However, TikTok isn’t alone in posting impressive ad reach figures this quarter.", "Potential ad reach across Facebook Inc.’s platforms now exceeds 3 billion", "The latest numbers reported in Facebook’s self-service tools indicate that the company’s portfolio of platforms now enables advertisers to reach a combined potential audience of more than 3 billion distinct users.", "That might not sound like ‘news’, because Facebook Inc.’s investor earnings reports indicate that the company’s Family Monthly Active People (FMAP) figure exceeded 3 billion in Q2 2020.", "However, that FMAP figure also includes WhatsApp’s 2 billion-plus users, and WhatsApp doesn’t currently offer advertising placements.", "Furthermore, our analysis suggests that total potential advertising reach on Facebook only equates to about 78 percent of the platform’s monthly active users (note that this is specific to the Facebook platform, and not the company’s overall portfolio of platforms; click here for a more detailed analysis).", "Based on the above, this is the first time that Facebook’s tools have reported a combined advertising audience in excess of 3 billion.", "These figures suggest that marketers can now reach more than 60 percent of all adults aged 13 and above outside of China using ads on Facebook’s portfolio of platforms.", "The company notes that – despite its efforts to ‘de-duplicate’ reach across platforms – there may still be some undetected ‘double-counting’ of audiences across different platforms, while ‘fake’ accounts may also account for a small percentage of total figures.", "However, based on the figures for potential audience duplication and fake accounts that the company has cited in documentation such as its investor earnings announcements, advertising on Facebook Inc.’s portfolio of platforms should still reach roughly half of all the world’s population aged 13 and above outside of China.", "For context, the latest data published in the company’s own self-service advertising tools indicate that:", "Facebook offers total potential advertising reach of 2.28 billion", "Instagram offers total potential advertising reach of 1.39 billion", "Facebook Messenger offers total potential advertising reach of 1.09 billion", "These numbers show that there’s plenty of identifiable overlap in the audiences of each platform, which is separate to the undetected double-counting described above.", "However, the company’s data suggests that more than 600 million active Instagram users do not use Facebook, which highlights the value of Facebook Inc.’s portfolio approach.", "GWI’s latest data tells a slightly different story, with a greater degree of overlap across platforms.", "However, it’s worth noting that GWI’s data focuses on internet users aged 16 to 64 in a selection of the world’s larger economies.", "The number of users in India that advertisers can reach using ads on Snapchat has surged by more than 16 percent over the past three months.", "India has now overtaken the United States to claim top spot in the ranking of Snapchat’s advertising markets, even though the platform’s reach in the US also continues to increase.", "Marketers can now reach almost 116 million users in India via ads on Snapchat, compared with 106 million users in the United States.", "India now accounts for more than 21 percent of Snapchat’s total worldwide ad audience, and almost 29 percent of the platform’s global male audience.", "Interestingly, male users account for nearly 60 percent of Snapchat’s ad audience in India, compared with a global male average of just under 45 percent.", "Snapchat has delivered healthy growth in global advertising reach over the past quarter too, adding 24 million new users since our Digital 2021 July Global Statshot Report to take the platform’s total global ad reach to 538 million.", "At a global level, Snapchat is more popular with women than it is with men, with female users accounting for 54.4 percent of the platform’s addressable advertising audience.", "In terms of ad reach compared with eligible populations aged 13 and above, Snapchat appears to be particularly popular with audiences in the Middle East and Scandinavia.", "The latest data from Skai (formerly Kenshoo) reveals that the cost of reaching audiences on social media has increased significantly over the past 12 months.", "The company’s latest Digital Marketing Quarterly Trends Report reveals that the average global CPM (cost per thousand impressions) has increased by more than 33 percent since this time last year.", "Even more tellingly, Skai’s data shows that average social media CPMs in Q3 this year were already above the average CPM value for last year’s ‘holiday’ season in Q4, suggesting that marketers may want to brace themselves for some significantly higher prices between now and the end of the year.", "For context, Q4 2020 CPMs were 31 percent higher than Q3 2020 values.", "Past performance isn’t always a reliable indicator of future trends of course, but if we were to see a similar trend this year, marketers shouldn’t be surprised to see average social media CPMs reach USD $9 for the last 3 months of 2021.", "A similar pattern of ad cost inflation is evident in search advertising too, with Skai reporting a 30 percent year-on-year increase in the average global search cost per click (CPC).", "Similar to the latest social media trends, search CPCs in Q3 2021 were already well above the average CPC in 2020’s ‘holiday’ quarter (Q4), suggesting we may see even higher costs associated with search advertising over the coming months.", "It is worth noting that overall spend on social media ads appears to have dipped in Q3 2021 compared to the same quarter last year, with Skai’s data showing a roughly 6 percent year-on-year drop in social media ad spend.", "Spend on search ads still increased though, with the latest data indicating a 32 percent year-on-year increase in the total global spend on search advertising.", "Data from App Annie shows that virtual private networks (VPNs) were the ‘breakout’ story in global app downloads in Q3, accounting for 6 of the top 10 non-game apps with the most significant increase in worldwide downloads between July and September 2021.", "For context, data from GWI shows that nearly 3 in 10 internet users already use a VPN for at least some of their internet activity, but as with so many aspects of our digital behaviour, the picture varies meaningfully between countries.", "Internet users in South and Southeast Asia are the most likely to make use of VPNs, with more than 4 in 10 working-age internet users in India and Indonesia saying they use these tools at least some of the time.", "However, there doesn’t appear to be any meaningful correlation between broader privacy fears and the use of VPNs.", "Overall, men are significantly more likely to use a VPN than women are.", "GWI’s latest data reveals that roughly one-third of all male internet users aged 16 to 64 already use VPNs, compared to less than a quarter of their female peers.", "The latest research from GWI shows that more than 1 in 5 internet users aged 16 to 64 around the world now listens to a podcast each week.", "However, this figure rises to roughly 1 in 3 amongst the same demographic in Mexico, Brazil, and Indonesia.", "Podcasts are most popular amongst younger women, with nearly a quarter of female internet users aged 16 to 24 saying that they’ve listened to a podcast in the past week.", "However, roughly 1 in 7 internet users aged 55 to 64 also listened to at least one podcast in the past 7 days.", "Perhaps most tellingly, however, the typical internet user around the world says that they now listen to an average of almost an hour of podcast content every day, which is up by more than 3½ percent over the past three months.", "Over the next few weeks, you can look forward to a whole host of 2022 trends reports from some of the world’s top futurists.", "Many of those reports will likely focus on areas like NFTs, the metaverse, artificial intelligence, and cybersecurity, so – rather than repeat those same themes here – I thought it might be more helpful to look at some of the more immediate and more actionable trends that we’ve been tracking in our Global Digital Reports.", "Amongst these trends, there are two that I think all marketers will want to explore in more detail:", "New tools and new platforms have significantly increased the range of content that’s available and accessible to the world’s internet users.", "At the most basic level, the improved availability, accuracy, and sophistication of online translation tools mean that it’s never been easier for people to access content that was written in languages other than their own native tongue.", "These tools are becoming more popular too, with various trends in our reports showing a steady rise in the number of people who translate text content online.", "Meanwhile, TikTok’s content-focused algorithm means that the platform’s billion-plus users now have significantly more chance of being exposed to content created by someone on the other side of the world than they would have had on platforms where algorithms prioritise a user’s social graph.", "Similarly, the surge in popularity of ‘international’ TV shows like Squid Game, Money Heist and Lupin, means that ‘cultural borders’ are becoming increasingly blurred.", "Furthermore, with Netflix announcing that it will increase investments in ‘local’ content intended for global audiences, and with TikTok reaching an ever larger global audience, we can expect that blurring to accelerate in 2022.", "This trend has critical implications for marketers and content creators everywhere, so click here to learn more about this trend and what it might mean for you.", "The world’s online search behaviours are becoming ever more diverse and fragmented.", "The use of voice search continues to increase, especially amongst smartphone users in low- and middle-income countries.", "Similarly, the use of image recognition tools has already become an essential consideration for marketers in many parts of the world, especially across Latin America and Southeast Asia.", "Meanwhile, nearly three-quarters of internet users aged 16 to 64 say that they turn to social media when researching products and services that they’re thinking of buying, making ‘social search’ one of 2022’s top opportunities.", "Given the importance of brand discovery and research for marketers, we’ve produced a complete guide to these evolving search behaviours, and their potential implications for brands.", "You can read that guide in full – and for free – by clicking here.", "In addition to those two essential trends, marketers may also want to explore the themes outlined below.", "These themes aren’t projections or forecasts per se; rather, they’re intended to be provocations that inspire more focused thinking, as well as some new ideas.", "People are increasingly looking beyond national borders to find the perfect product, especially when small domestic markets mean that local choices are limited.", "Amazon is already making it easier for customers to shop in its other country ‘stores’, and is increasingly offering competitive global delivery too.", "Meanwhile, ecommerce platform players like Shopify and Magento are making it easier for independent retailers to engage and serve overseas shoppers.", "However, it’s the impact of cross-cultural content – as described above – that will likely play the biggest role in accelerating shoppers’ interest in cross-border commerce in 2022.", "Cross-border commerce has its challenges though, from basic issues like language barriers and cultural references, to logistics issues like speed of delivery and the cost of returns.", "Online shopping platforms in the West have become masters of ‘checkout efficiency’, but the rise of live-stream shopping formats in Asia demonstrates that there are other successful approaches to ecommerce.", "As competition increases in the online shopping world, we can expect to see ecommerce players experiment with new formats that emphasise areas such as social interaction, shopper entertainment, and even augmented services like education (e.g. ‘how-to’ content).", "Regulation is already one of the hottest topics in digital, but we can expect legal and ethical considerations to have even greater bearing in 2022.", "On the one hand, governments are putting digital giants under increasing pressure, from China’s emphasis on ‘common prosperity’, to America’s push to mitigate foreign interference and mental health risks, and the EU’s action on competition and taxation.", "Increased activism won’t be restricted to governments either; we can also expect to see other companies join Apple and Google in taking proactive steps to protect user privacy and safety.", "This may make it seem like there’s more complexity ahead, but my top tip is to embrace these changes.", "Proactivity in the areas of consumer safety and privacy will help you to define the best agenda for your business (rather than being reactive), and proactivity should also position you as a more trustworthy brand amongst your customers.", "Entertainment, communication, and retail were the first industries to experience ‘comprehensive’ digital disruption, and various other industries are currently undergoing significant digital transformation.", "However, while no industry has escaped digital’s influence, it seems that large-scale disruption has yet to impact three critical categories: education, healthcare, and consumer finance.", "It’s true that COVID has accelerated movement in all of these categories – particularly education – but we can expect to see digital disruption accelerate in these industries in 2022, particularly now that COVID has helped us to overcome some of the initial barriers and inertia.", "Various reports have indicated that cybercrime has increased significantly in the past couple of years.", "As a result, digital literacy and online safety will become increasingly important for individuals, as well as for the governments that look to protect them.", "However, the most worrying cybersecurity threats go well beyond the individual, and – sadly – we can expect to see increased cyber attacks on companies, sovereign nations, and even ideologies in the coming months.", "I seem to raise this topic every year, but I’m more convinced than ever that we’re overdue a ‘disruptive’ innovation in the interfaces that we use to engage with our connected devices.", "The most obvious candidate is some form of augmented, ‘heads-up’ display – most likely in the form of AR glasses – with Facebook and Apple both tipped to be launching new products ‘imminently’.", "However, in the longer-term, direct-to-brain interfaces may completely remove the need for physical devices, enabling users to augment their thinking and perceive physical sensations directly through the stimulation of their brain, nervous system, and hormone receptors.", "A move away from screen-based interfaces would help to inspire and promote a wider range of more integrated uses of connected technology.", "For context, most of today’s digital products and services are standalone ‘destinations’: we still need to ‘visit’ Facebook, Amazon, Netflix, etc., and – for the most part – they dominate our attention while we use them.", "However, the next wave of digital innovation will use connectivity to add an augmented ‘layer’ to other activities, creating new dimensions and adding new value within those experiences, without necessarily becoming their central focus.", "In the long run, connectivity will become something akin to electricity: an essential source of power for much of what we do, yet something that we don’t need to think about, because it’s not the core focus of attention.", "And for my final provocation this year, an ‘anti-trend’…", "In the advisory sessions that I run for Kepios’s clients, it’s becoming increasingly clear that many marketers feel overwhelmed by the pace and diversity of digital innovation.", "Part of this is self-inflicted, and relates to our industry’s obsession with ‘shiny new objects’ – we’re like Dug the dog from Pixar’s Up!, constantly getting distracted by every passing squirrel.", "However, a bigger part of this challenge relates to the sheer scale and breadth of what marketers actually need to know in order to do their jobs, as well as the pressure to experiment and the FOMO that we feel every time a new platform or tool comes along.", "But this constant focus on the future may be compromising our ability to perform in the present.", "So, while it’s important to keep an eye on what’s next, we perhaps need to spend a bit less time future-gazing, and make better use of what we already have.", "Be honest with yourself: what will have a greater impact on your marketing ROI in 2022 – launching an NFT, getting involved in the metaverse, or optimising the media efficiency of your social media spend?", "Yes, NFTs are exciting, but if you’re a marketer, you’ll most likely only be able to use them as a one-off PR stunt.", "Critically, if NFTs are central to your organisation’s future success, it’s unlikely that marketing will be leading the NFT charge.", "Similarly, the metaverse may well become a ‘place’ where your audience spends an increasing share of its time.", "However, that’s not going to happen overnight, whereas people already spend 2½ hours a day on social media, and that figure continues to increase.", "Don’t get me wrong; NFTs and the metaverse both have plenty of future business potential, but I doubt that either will be the answer to your marketing woes in 2022.", "So, do yourself a mental health favour: set aside a couple of hours a month for future gazing (our custom briefings could be a great option), but focus the majority of your time and attention on the things that will ensure you succeed today.", "That’s all for this quarter’s analysis, but I’ll be back in January with our flagship Digital 2022 report.", "Until then, don’t forget that you can

We’ve been able to re-calculate internet user figures for last year based on the same sources we’ve used this year, so the annual and quarterly growth figures we’ve included in this year’s reports accurately reflect how much internet user numbers have changed over time.", "Please refer to these published growth figures whenever you want to compare changes over time.", "You’ll find our complete Digital 2021 Global Overview Report in the SlideShare embed below (click here if that’s not working for you), but read on below for my detailed analysis of this year’s top headlines and trends.", "Here are the headline stats and trends for the global ‘State of Digital’ in January 2021:", "Population: the world’s population stood at 7.83 billion at the start of 2021.

the world’s total population.", "Despite these impressive figures, it’s worth noting that the ongoing coronavirus pandemic has significantly impacted research into internet use around the world, so many countries have been unable to provide updates to internet user numbers in the past 12 months.", "As a result, internet user numbers have likely grown more than the reported 7 percent, and we may see ‘corrections’ to these figures once everyday life (and research) can return to normal.", "But beyond tasty trivia, what does all this data tell us about what people are actually doing online?",

– a full half an hour more than second-placed Colombians.", "At the other end of the scale, users in Japan say they spend less than an hour a day on social media, although this year’s figure of 51 minutes is still 13 percent higher than Japanese users reported spending on social channels this time last year.", "The latest data from GSMA Intelligence shows that two-thirds of the world’s total population uses a mobile phone today.", "This figure has remained steady for the past few years, but that’s perhaps not surprising when we consider that the world’s 5.2 billion mobile users equate to more than 85 percent of all the people on Earth aged 13 and above.", "But mobile’s dominance isn’t just about user numbers; it’s also about time spent, and how that compares to other devices.", "Data from App Annie shows that Android users around the world now spend more than 4 hours each day using their phones.", "In total, that means Android users spent more than 3.5 trillion cumulative hours using their phones over the past 12 months.", "And perhaps more tellingly, App Annie’s flagship State of Mobile 2021 report also reveals that mobiles now account for a greater amount of people’s time than live TV.", "This is the case even in the United States, where the average American now spends more than 4 hours per day using their mobile phone, compared to roughly 3¾ hours each day watching live TV.", "GWI reports similar findings, with the company’s latest research finding that a typical global internet user now spends 3 hours and 39 minutes each day using the internet on their mobile phone.", "This compares to a total of 3 hours and 24 minutes per day watching television, but it’s worth noting that people are increasingly watching “TV” content via streaming apps on their mobile devices too.", "However, mobile devices only account for about half of our daily internet time.", "In total, the average internet user now spends almost 7 hours per day using the internet across all devices, equating to more than 48 hours per week online – that’s a full two days out of a seven-day week.", "Assuming that the average person sleeps for between 7 and 8 hours per day, this means that we now spend roughly 42 percent of our waking lives online, and that we spend almost as much time using the internet as we do sleeping.", "The figures also show that people are spending more time online each day than they did in previous years.", "The latest findings from GWI show that the typical internet user spent 16 minutes longer online each day in Q3 2020 than they did in Q3 2019, representing a year-on-year increase of 4 percent.", "If these rates continue throughout 2021, the world’s internet users will spend almost 12 trillion hours online this year, which translates to more than 1.3 billion years of combined human time.", "However, as we saw in last year’s report, there’s significant variation in the amount of time that people in different countries spend online.", "Filipinos report spending the greatest amount of time online, at an average of almost 11 hours per day.", "Brazilians, Colombians, and South Africans also say they spend an average of more than 10 hours per day online.", "At the other end of the scale, the Japanese report spending the least amount of time online, at less than 4½ hours per day.", "Interestingly, the figure for China also falls at the lower end of the spectrum, at just 5 hours and 22 minutes per day – 1½ hours less than the global average of 6 hours and 54 minutes.", "Mobile phones now account for roughly 53 percent of the time the world spends online, but the data clearly shows that other devices still play important roles in our connected lives.", "9 in 10 internet users say they go online via a smartphone, but two-thirds also say that they use a laptop or desktop computer to access the internet.", "However, once again, things vary considerably by country.", "Mobiles are now the most widely used internet device in all countries, but the gap between mobiles and computers is often quite small, especially in Western Europe.", "For example, 46 percent of Belgium’s internet users say that computers are their primary internet devices, compared to 49 percent for phones, and 5 percent for tablets.", "Japan also sees relatively high computer use, with more than 4 in 10 internet users saying they prefer to go online via a laptop or desktop device.", "The stage of a country’s economic development plays a role in shaping these ratios, but the median age of the population is also a critical driver.", "As GWI reports, Baby Boomers are more likely to go online via computers and tablets than via phones, with mobile devices accounting for less than 50 percent of total internet time amongst users aged 45 and above.", "Meanwhile, the latest data from StatCounter shows that computers still account for a meaningful share of the world’s web activity.", "More than 40 percent of web pages served in December 2020 were requested by web browsers running on laptop and desktop devices, although the overall share of these devices is down slightly compared to December 2019.", "The relative importance of different devices also varies considerably between countries.", "StatCounter’s data shows that mobile phones account for more than 8 in 10 pages served to web browsers in Nigeria, but that figure drops to barely a quarter of web pages served to browsers in Russia.", "It’s worth highlighting that web browsing only accounts for a small share of overall mobile time, with people spending far more time using mobile apps.", "The latest data from App Annie reveals that native apps account for 92 percent of the time that the world’s Android users spend on their phones, while just 8 percent of that time is spent using mobile web browsers.", "One simple takeaway is that mobile is clearly an essential part of the mix, but we certainly can’t ignore other devices – especially in Western markets, or when we’re hoping to engage older audiences.", "Finding information is the main reason why people go online, with almost two-thirds of the world’s internet users saying this is one of their top motivations.", "However, the latest research from GWI shows that the world’s search behaviours are evolving, and their changing behaviour has important consequences for anyone hoping to engage a digital audience.", "Conventional search engines are still an essential part of the mix of course, with a massive 98 percent of respondents saying that they use a search engine every month.", "However, more than 7 in 10 respondents also say that they now use at least one tool other than text-based search engines to find information online each month.", "Voice interfaces are the most popular alternative to text-based search engines, with 45 percent of global internet users saying that they used voice search or voice commands in the past 30 days.", "It’s important to stress that digital assistants on mobile phones, such as Siri and Google Assistant, account for the majority of this voice activity.", "Smart speakers represent an exciting opportunity, but barely 1 in 12 internet users around the world owns one of these devices today, so their potential is still limited outside of North America and Europe.", "Almost a third of the world’s internet users also use image recognition tools on their mobiles each month, with tools such as Pinterest Lens and Google Lens seeing particularly strong adoption across Latin America and Southeast Asia.", "Young women are the most likely to use an image as their search query, with GWI’s research showing that 4 in 10 female internet users aged 16 to 64 have used one of these tools in the past month.", "These tools represent a particularly interesting opportunity for ecommerce brands, especially those in highly aesthetic categories like fashion, beauty, and home furnishing – and even consumer electronics.", "However, it’s easy to see how image recognition technology could also augment other internet-powered tools.", "For example, a curious diner might access a restaurant’s reviews by snapping a picture of the storefront while they’re standing outside, and using that photo as a search query.", "Perhaps the most interesting trend in evolving search behaviours is the rise of social search.", "Roughly 45 percent of global internet users say that they turn to social networks at least once per month when looking for information about products or services that they’re thinking of buying.", "However, that figure is considerably higher amongst younger age groups.", "Indeed, Gen Z internet users are now more likely to start their brand research on social networks than they are to turn to a search engine, and trends suggest that this will soon be the case for younger Millennials too.", "Digging a bit deeper into online search activities, this year’s reports reveal that people are more likely to research “how to do things” on the internet than they are to look for information about specific brands, products, or services.", "This finding has particular salience for marketers, because it offers valuable insights into the best ways to engage an audience.", "For example, rather than merely telling people that your brand is the ideal solution for a particular problem, a ‘how-to’ video may be a more effective way of capturing their attention.", "Teaching people how to get the best out of your products and services is a great way to add mutual value, improve satisfaction, and potentially boost contextual relevance and recall.", "People are actively asking for this kind of content, too.", "Research from GWI that we covered back in our Digital 2020 April Global Statshot Report found that people were actively seeking out more ‘how-to’ videos and tutorial content during COVID-19 lockdowns.", "And while these findings may have been asked in the specific context of coping with the impact of coronavirus movement restrictions, the ongoing ‘motivations’ data that you’ll find on slide 48 of our Digital 2021 Global Overview Report confirm the enduring appeal of this kind of content.", "Another interesting trend we’ve spotted in this year’s search data provides evidence of the rise of content collaboration, as well as third-party mashups and remixes.", "For context, this trend has been particularly evident in the recent ‘Wellerman’ meme, where people across the world have joined forces for duets of popular sea shanties.", "Already hugely popular on TikTok, these videos have found their way across to YouTube too, often in the form of curated collections or remixes of content that was originally published to TikTok.", "However, data from Google Trends suggests that this kind of content ‘porting’ isn’t an entirely new phenomenon.", "If we were to consider ‘Tik Tok’ and ‘TikTok’ (one query with a space, one without) as being essentially the same search, TikTok would have been the third most popular search term on YouTube across the whole of 2020.", "This latest ranking of YouTube queries also highlights the importance of music to the world’s second largest social platform.", "In 2020, 13 of the 20 most popular search terms on YouTube related specifically to music, with 8 of those including some version of the word “song” (including equivalents in non-English languages).", "Internet users’ enthusiasm for music isn’t restricted to YouTube either.", "Google Trends’ ranking of the 20 most common search queries on Google throughout 2020 also features ‘MP3’ in fifteenth place, highlighting the enduring appeal of music downloads despite the rising popularity of music streaming.", "Music streaming is a clear winner too though, with App Annie’s State of Mobile 2021 report revealing that Spotify was the ninth most-used mobile app around the world in 2020.", "And while many musicians may have a different perspective, it’s clear that there’s money to be made in online music too, with Sirius XM’s Pandora ranking 10th in App Annie’s list of the top 10 mobile apps by consumer spend in 2020.", "New data from Ookla shows that internet connection speeds accelerated rapidly over the past year, with average mobile speeds increasing by almost 50 percent compared to this time last year.", "Around the world, the average mobile data connection now offers download speeds of more than 47 megabits per second, which is more than 15 megabits per second faster than the average we reported in our Digital 2020 report.", "The year-on-year pace of change for mobile connections accelerated by roughly 70 percent compared to last year’s figures, indicating that 5G is already delivering tangible benefits for the world’s mobile internet users.", "GSMA Intelligence reports that more than 4 in 5 mobile users around the world now have a connection which is capable of delivering ‘broadband’ data speeds, although not all of these connections will include a data subscription.", "The number of connections identified as “3G or above” grew by roughly 8 percent over the past year, although – once again – the figures vary considerably by geography.", "Perhaps surprisingly, North Korea is one of just 4 countries where all mobile connections are 3G or above.", "At the other end of the scale, there are now just 6 countries where fewer than 20 percent of mobile connections are capable of delivering broadband data speeds.", "There’s a big difference between 3G and 5G though, and the countries that have already activated 5G networks are already seeing significant benefits in terms of mobile data speeds.", "For example, 5G is now readily available on some mobile networks in Qatar, China, and Kuwait, and all 3 of these countries have seen average mobile internet connection speeds more than double over the past 12 months.", "The increased bandwidth available on 5G networks is also starting to make a tangible difference in the continued growth in global mobile data consumption.", "Ericsson reports that the world now consumes roughly 55 billion gigabytes of mobile data each month, with each smartphone device consuming an average of 9.4GB of data per month.", "The company reports that 5G currently accounts for around 4 percent of total mobile data traffic, but forecasts that this will jump to more than 10 percent this year, and more than half of all mobile traffic by 2026.", "These figures all point to the rapidly growing influence of 5G networks on the world’s mobile landscape.", "For a start, faster connections mean that people should be able to enjoy richer content experiences while on the go.", "The average mobile connection is now fast enough to enable users to stream 4K video without any disruption, although given the size of most mobile phone screens, this may not deliver substantial benefits to the average mobile viewer compared to streaming in 1080p.", "However, 5G should bring more tangible benefits to mobile gamers, because 5G is designed to deliver significantly reduced latency.", "This metric is particularly relevant to ‘shooter’ games – the world’s most popular video game format – because connection latency determines how quickly people can see and react to on-screen action.", "Ookla’s latest data shows that average latency across the world’s mobile connections has decreased from 41ms to 36ms over the past year, although the latest mobile figure is still 70 percent slower than the average fixed internet connection.", "However, 5G connections will enable video game companies to offer more compelling mobile-oriented gaming titles in genres where latency is an important consideration, which may significantly increase the appeal of these games across geographies that currently struggle with slower connections.", "This is particularly pertinent in the developing world, where fixed internet infrastructure is often unavailable, and where it does exist, mobile connection speeds are often faster anyway.", "But this is also true in some of the world’s highly developed economies.", "For example, average mobile connection speeds in Australia, the UAE, and Saudi Arabia all outpace the average speed of each country’s fixed internet connections.", "The greater bandwidth offered by 5G should also improve options for people who want to broadcast their own livestreams.", "This has particular relevance to mobile esports and mobile game live-streaming, which depend on fast, stable connections for the best experience.", "Beyond gaming, improved mobile upload speeds will also enable a greater number of people to get involved in live commerce, empowering a new wave of mobile entrepreneurs to sell their wares in real-time via live-stream promotions.", "So, if you’re wondering how 5G might impact your marketing, my tip would be to think beyond current marketing activities, and ask yourself whether now might be a good time to start exploring mobile gaming or live-stream commerce opportunities for your brand.", "One of the most interesting takeaways from the rankings of the world’s top websites in this year’s reports is that a large amount of social media activity still takes place within mobile browsers.", "For example, Semrush reports that Facebook still attracts 1.8 billion unique visitors to its website each month, which equates to roughly two-thirds of its monthly active user base.", "Facebook’s own data suggest that most of these users will be using the company’s native mobile apps more frequently than they visit the web interface, but it’s still interesting to see that the website continues to play an important role.", "However, the figures for some other social platforms are perhaps more surprising.", "For example, WhatsApp and Instagram also attract huge volumes of traffic to their web presences, despite being clearly positioned as ‘app-first’ experiences.", "Semrush also reports that Instagram’s website saw more than 830 million unique visitors in December, while WhatsApp.com attracted 276 million uniques.", "Even TikTok – with its considerable Gen Z skew – attracted almost 200 million visits to its website in December 2020.", "Data from SimilarWeb echoes these findings, with the company reporting even higher unique visitor numbers than Semrush for some of these platforms.", "One hypothesis is that this web traffic is the result of ‘off-platform’ sharing, such as when someone sends a link to an Instagram post via a messenger app like Telegram.", "Meanwhile, when it comes to services like WhatsApp, we might conclude that considerable numbers of people are chatting via the platform’s web interface.", "These findings may not have immediate implications for brands’ advertising activities, but they do offer interesting insights into how the world uses the internet, and in particular, how people’s journeys across different digital platforms take shape.", "A more strategic approach to social media marketing", "In-depth analysis of data collected by GWI shows that at least 98 percent of the users of any given social media platform use at least one other social platform.", "The audiences of individual social platforms are also subject to significant overlaps, with 85 percent of TikTok users aged 16 to 64 saying they use Facebook, and almost 95 percent of Instagram users saying they also use YouTube.", "The extent of these audience overlaps has particular relevance to marketers, who often spend significant amounts of time debating which platforms to use for their activities.", "The key takeaway here is that brands do not need to be active on every single platform, and in fact the data show that a presence on just one or two of the larger platforms offers the potential to reach almost all of the world’s social media users.", "For context, at least 6 platforms now have more than 1 billion monthly active users, while at least 17 have more than 300 million.", "However, this doesn’t mean that marketers should focus solely on these larger platforms.", "Indeed, the data support the argument for a more strategic, portfolio approach to social media.", "Rather than focusing all of their attention on reach, marketers can now explore other factors, such as the specific creative opportunities offered by each platform’s content formats, or the different engagement opportunities available on more ‘niche’ platforms.", "And the good news is that – if we look beyond reach – we have plenty of options to choose from, even when it comes to social media.", "GWI’s data shows that the typical global user now has a presence on more than 8 different social channels, although the data also indicate that people use these channels with varying frequency and different levels of engagement.", "However, it’s very unlikely that people use each of their 8.4 different platforms for exactly the same purpose.", "GWI’s data clearly show that people use social platforms for a variety of different reasons, and these underlying motivations offer a far better basis for planning than reach figures alone.", "So, next time you’re planning a campaign, look beyond platform user numbers, and ask yourself:", "Which platform(s) will be most relevant to their motivations?", "How can I use these channels to achieve my desired outcomes?", "As we’ll see in the next sections though, people’s motivations and platform choices also vary meaningfully by location and by demographic, so be sure to dig into our latest local country reports for richer insights into your specific audience’s behaviours.", "The internet may seem like a truly global environment, but the data in this year’s reports clearly show that people’s behaviours and preferences vary considerably between geographies.", "Furthermore, while many platforms are popular amongst users all over the world, the ways in which people use those platforms often differ meaningfully between geographies.", "For these reasons, marketers need to invest time to understand the nuances of their specific audiences.", "In particular, global marketers need to go beyond the headlines reported in Western media, because trends in these countries are only representative of a small fraction of global digital audiences.", "For context, the United States accounts for fewer than 1 in 15 (6.4 percent) of the world’s internet users.", "Users across the whole of the EU and the UK account for less than 10 percent of the global total, while internet users across all of the world’s 60-plus ‘highly developed’ economies account for less than one-third of the world’s total connected population.", "And just in case you’re thinking that developed economies account for the majority of the world’s spending, Statista reports that China – which doesn’t feature in that list of ‘developed’ economies – now accounts for almost half (46 percent) of the world’s total consumer ecommerce spending.", "The first step is to pay closer attention to what’s happening at a local level.", "You’ll find all of our latest reports for every single country in the world – completely for free – in the DataReportal library.", "I’d also recommend going beyond headlines to identify the corresponding audience for each “juicy stat”.", "Don’t assume that reports of a meteoric rise in the users of a new social platform have any bearing on your audience in your country.", "It’s always better to invest time to find out which channels your audience prefers, and what they use each platform for.", "In many cases, you may find that digital platforms that haven’t made the news for years in your home country are still the dominant choice in another market.", "A good example of this is Yahoo!, which remains one of the top destinations for audiences in Japan.", "However, it’s also important to look beyond your bubble – especially if you want to identify emerging trends that may shape your audience’s future behaviour.", "Various trends suggest that the ‘next big trend’ in digital won’t emerge from a Western market.", "For example, as we saw above, the connected behaviours of people across Asia and Latin America are already reshaping online search.", "Similarly, the popularity of live-streaming has revolutionised online shopping in China, where the ‘live commerce’ market is now worth around US$60 billion a year.", "The live-stream shopping format has become so popular in China that just one influencer – Viya – sold more than US$4.5 billion through her Taobao live-stream channel last year.", "For context, reports suggest that this equates to roughly the same amount that supermarket chain Carrefour sold across all its stores in China in the same period.", "However, data shows that the popularity of live commerce isn’t just a Chinese phenomenon, with the format also picking up momentum across Southeast Asia and India.", "What’s more, these three regions – China, Southern Asia, and Southeastern Asia – account for more than half of today’s global internet user base, so this is an opportunity that marketers around the world will want to tap into, even if live-stream shopping hasn’t taken off in their home market yet.", "Developing nations are also leading the way when it comes to innovations in digital finance.", "For example, the latest data from GWI shows that internet users across Africa, Latin America, and Southeast Asia are far more likely to own cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, compared to their peers in Europe and North America.", "However, the impact of these trends isn’t restricted to the developing world; they also have real significance for marketers in the West.", "With many developed nations already seeing internet adoption rates in excess of 90 percent, big internet companies from the US and China know that they need to look to emerging markets to secure the next wave of growth.", "To ensure the best possible chances of success, these companies also know that they’ll need to tailor their products and services to the needs, behaviours, and preferences of these new audiences.", "However, economies of scale are a critical consideration for big internet companies, which means that they’re unlikely to develop significantly different products for each region or local market.", "As a result, we can expect to see the influence of trends and developments in developing markets appear in Western platforms too, potentially resulting in changes in behaviour across developed economies as well.", "We’ve included a wealth of new charts in this year’s reports that offer insights into connected activities by age and gender.", "One of the most revealing of these charts shows how adoption of ecommerce varies by demographic.", "And the clear takeaway from this GWI data is that internet users in the Baby Boomer generation are only marginally less likely to use ecommerce than Gen Z and Millennial internet users.", "Moreover, female internet users aged 55 to 64 are actually more likely to shop online than male internet users aged 16 to 24.", "It’s important to stress that these figures only reflect people’s behaviours once they start using the internet; the data doesn’t show ecommerce penetration against the broader population.", "Nevertheless, these findings clearly show the near universal appeal of ecommerce amongst internet users, regardless of their age or gender.", "And the obvious takeaway here is that online shopping represents a large and compelling opportunity for almost all consumer brands, regardless of category or target audience.", "However, there are some important differences in how people of different ages go about their online shopping.", "GWI’s data show that younger generations are considerably more likely to use a mobile phone to make online purchases, but these figures tail off quite quickly amongst their parents’ generation.", "Conversely, Baby Boomers are considerably more likely to buy things online via a laptop or desktop computer.", "Nearly twice as many internet users aged 55 to 64 say they bought something via a computer in the past month compared to internet users aged 16 to 24.", "However, these figures relate solely to checkout, and there’s a high likelihood that older generations will still be using mobile devices to inform the rest of their ‘buyer journey’.", "For example, while it’s not mobile-specific, data from GWI shows that older age groups are the most likely to research products online before making a purchase.", "More than 6 in 10 male internet users over the age of 45 say that they go online to look for information about products and services that they’re thinking of buying, compared to just 51 percent of men aged 16 to 24.", "It’s also interesting to note that a significant share of older internet users play video games.", "Perhaps unsurprisingly, gaming adoption rates amongst older generations aren’t as high as they are for Gen Z, where more than 90 percent of internet users say they play games.", "However, GWI’s data still shows that more than two-thirds of internet users aged 55 to 64 around the world play video games.", "But once again, there are plenty of differences lurking beneath the surface of these headline findings.", "For example, as we saw in the earlier section on internet connection speeds, older gamers have different preferences when it comes to the kinds of games they play, with ‘puzzle’ formats particularly popular amongst Baby Boomers.", "Another age-related trend is evident in our latest social media data, which shows that older age groups are the fastest-growing segments of many platforms’ audiences.", "For example, Facebook saw users over the age of 65 increase by roughly 25 percent over the past year – that’s almost double the average across all age groups of 13 percent since this time last year.", "Meanwhile, users over the age of 50 also represent Snapchat’s fastest-growing audience segment.", "The number of users aged 50 and above that advertisers can reach on Snapchat has grown by roughly 25 percent in the past 3 months, with male users in this age group increasing by a third.", "Note that these Snapchat figures represent quarterly growth, while the Facebook figures above showcase annual growth.", "It’s also worth noting that these figures represent relative growth, not the absolute increase in user numbers.", "Older age groups typically account for a smaller percentage of overall social media users than younger demographics, so it’s perhaps ‘easier’ for older age groups to record faster growth.", "For context, users aged 25 to 34 still accounted for the greatest number of new Facebook users over the past year, even though they were already the platform’s largest demographic segment.", "However, these relative growth figures still show that a greater number of older users are joining social platforms.", "These evolving demographics may bring new opportunities for marketers, together with new revenue streams for platforms and publishers.", "One of the standout digital stories in 2020 was the rise of ecommerce, with the COVID-19 pandemic driving consumers all over the world to embrace online shopping.", "With GWI data showing that most internet users already made online purchases even before the pandemic, there wasn’t much scope for an overall increase in ecommerce adoption rates amongst internet users.", "However, GWI data still shows that ecommerce adoption rates increased by 3.3 percentage points between Q2 and Q3 2020, representing quarterly growth of more than 4½ percent.", "At a global level, nearly 77 percent of internet users aged 16 to 64 say they buy something online each month.", "Internet users in Indonesia are the most likely to make ecommerce purchases, with more than 87 percent of the country’s respondents to GWI’s survey saying they bought something online in the past month.", "At the other end of the scale, just 57 percent of internet users in Egypt say they made an online purchase in the past 30 days.", "The ecommerce adoption rate is also relatively low in Russia, where just 60 percent of internet users say they bought something via the internet in the past month.", "As we saw in the previous section, there isn’t a significant difference in ecommerce adoption rates by age and gender, at least at a global level.", "However, a more interesting story lies in what people have been buying over recent months.", "Before we dig into the numbers, it’s worth pointing out that different sources report quite different findings for ecommerce activity, so data points on some slides may appear to contradict similar data points on other charts.", "These differences don’t represent an error; rather, they illustrate that different metrics may tell a different story about what people have been doing across different parts of the internet.", "Statista reports that the Fashion and Beauty category accounted for the largest share of global B2C ecommerce revenues in 2020, at more than US$665 billion.", "This is the first time in our ongoing series of Global Digital Reports that the Travel category hasn’t come out top, highlighting just how difficult recent months have been for travel and tourism brands.", "Indeed, Statista reports that online revenues in the Travel, Mobility and Accommodation category were down by more than 50 percent year-on-year, resulting in a drop of well over half a trillion US dollars in annual consumer spending.", "On the other hand, many other categories saw strong growth in ecommerce revenues in 2020.", "Food & Personal Care was the fastest growing category, with COVID-19 lockdowns and social distancing measures acting as a catalyst for significant increases in online grocery shopping.", "Worldwide, the category saw annual revenues in excess of US $400 billion in 2020, up by more than 40 percent compared to the previous year.", "Data from Contentsquare also offers good news for online grocery brands, with traffic to supermarkets’ ecommerce properties 35 percent higher in December than it was in January.", "People haven’t just been visiting online grocery stores either; Contentsquare’s data shows that supermarkets’ online transactions were more than double their January 2020 levels in both November and December 2020.", "These numbers support findings that we shared in our Digital 2020 July Global Statshot Report, when we reported that significant numbers of internet users had been saying they intended to continue with new online shopping behaviours that they’d adopted during the first wave of COVID-19 lockdowns.", "Moreover, these numbers don’t just offer good news for supermarkets.", "Grocery shopping tends to be a high-frequency activity, which means that people have had the chance to develop new habits over recent months.", "As most marketers know, it can be very difficult to inspire behaviour change – especially in high-frequency activities – so the new shopping habits of recent months present an unparalleled opportunity for brands and retailers to challenge the status quo.", "And what’s more, we’re already seeing evidence that people’s habits have changed in other categories too.", "Online cosmetics purchases soared during the recent year-end holiday season, with shoppers around the world making more than 3½ times as many online category purchases in November 2020 as they did in January 2020.", "Some of this variance can likely be attributed to the category’s normal seasonality, but such a dramatic jump between January and December suggests that a significant number of purchases that people might previously have made in physical stores have now shifted online.", "This echoes findings from Adobe, who reported that:", "“…it would’ve taken between 4 and 6 years to get to the levels that we saw in May 2020 if growth had continued at the same levels [we’d seen] for the past few years.”", "Furthermore, it’s now highly unlikely that people’s shopping behaviours will return to pre-pandemic patterns once daily life returns to some semblance of normality.", "While we can expect to see people return to physical stores once health concerns ease, many people will likely continue to conduct a greater share of their shopping activities online than they did prior to 2020.", "These changes aren’t just about where people make their purchases, either.", "Our analysis suggests that people have moved a significant share of their activities across every step of the buyer journey into online channels, meaning that marketers may need to rethink every aspect of their activities – not just “last-mile” demand generation.", "Google dominates global digital – but a bit less than before", "It might not come as a surprise to learn that Google dominates almost every aspect of digital, but it’s still interesting to quantify the company’s position.", "More than 7 in 10 mobile handsets in use around the world today use the Android operating system, according to the latest web traffic data from Statcounter.", "Facebook’s data puts Android’s share even higher, with the company’s Insights tools indicating that more than 8 in 10 mobile Facebook users aged 18-plus access via an Android-powered device.", "Google’s position in the search market is stronger yet, with Statcounter’s latest data indicating that the platform enjoys more than 90 percent share of the global search market.", "Chrome is also the world’s favourite web

So it’s no wonder companies like AMC+ and Discovery+ rushed to strike similar long-term free trials with the telco.", "There’s a lot in it for streamers. A 12-month giveaway locks in customers long-term, giving streamers time to convince them their service is essential.", "For streaming services with ad-supported tiers, scaling up fast is also crucial to the advertising side, as marketers will only spend on streaming services if they believe there’s an audience there to target—and viewers on a free-trial are still targetable.", "Partnerships can also help companies save on marketing dollars. Acquiring new customers is expensive; Deloitte estimates that the average customer-acquisition cost in the streaming-video space is $200.", "If a subscription service charges $12 a month, it’ll take nearly a year and a half to recoup those marketing costs alone.", "Team up with an established service provider, and companies can divvy up the marketing costs.

While the exact terms of these arrangements depend on which companies are involved, partnerships can often mean one company buys subscriptions at a wholesale discount; other financial terms hinge on things like joint advertising budgets.", "At a high level, Beatty explained that “you have to look at what both companies can bring to the table as far as all the assets they have.”", "Scaling up fast doesn’t matter if consumers don’t stick around. Losing customers means companies then have to market to those consumers again—and that’s an expensive proposition considering the rate of re-marketing required.", "Around 50% of millennial consumers engage in what Deloitte called “churn and return” in its most recent Digital Media Trends report, meaning those customers subscribe, watch a show, cancel, and then re-subscribe again later, emphasized Kevin Westcott, vice chair and head of the US technology, media, and telecommunications practice at Deloitte.", "Audience turnover can threaten to undermine streaming services’ advertising businesses, which rely on returning eyeballs.", "“If my audience is churning every two to three months, it becomes a lot harder for me to actually deliver that audience and to provide those guarantees to the advertisers,” Westcott said.", "That means the focus shifts to convincing consumers to stick around when their trial runs out. Success rates vary, and most streamers are loath to share their conversion rates publicly, but Verizon has previously claimed that free customers convert to paid customers at a rate of 50%—70%.", "To further entice customers to stick around, some streaming services are making permanent complimentary offerings in a single package, like Disney’s streaming bundle, which packages Disney+, Hulu, and ESPN+ all-in-one.", "Other companies are looking at complimentary entertainment offerings, like in gaming and music.", "“If I have five different types of entertainment that I am getting through one bundle, it’s a lot harder for me to cancel,” Westcott explained.", "“It might feel like I’ve watched the shows I want to watch on the streaming side, but I really like my gaming subscription", "or I really enjoy the music streaming subscription that I listen to every day. That makes it harder to leave.”", "As companies create more permanent bundles, customers get another benefit: bigger discounts.", "“We can give you a better price if we bundle it all together, and the partners all work to negotiate that, and that makes customers stickier,” SiriusXM’s Beatty said.", "Plus, customers may find it easier to pay one time instead of juggling five different subscriptions.", "“It’s easier for the customer to manage,” Beatty said."]}

First, the binge release. In TV, it takes six weeks to set up in pre-production, then two weeks to shoot an episode, then four weeks to edit it, then some time for post-production.", "Not so with the binge. If you’re releasing ten episodes at the same time, the earliest your last episode can go up is four weeks from when the last episode finishes shooting.", "So that means that Netflix will take 10-20 weeks longer to finish a season.

Frankly, the reasons that AMC and Cinemark have been able to reopen are different from the reasons why the ArcLight can’t.", "AMC happens to be well-capitalized from their convenient Wall Street Bets-fueled stock sales and some debt restructuring.", "Thus, landlords can use the threat of AMC taking over abandoned ArcLight locations as pressure to force ArcLight to pay back rent or to pay higher rent right now.", "Long term, if all theatrical filmgoing disappears, then landlords with giant multiplexes are toast. As long as AMC and Cinemark survive, especially in high wealth locations, though, landlords will be fine.", "Smaller players, like ArcLight, are the losers in this situation.", "Second, note that Pacific Theaters has not actually filed for bankruptcy.

This can disadvantage the cloud in the purchasing decision, compared with a typical on-premises capital expenditure wherein customers can simply buy for peak-demand growth plus a margin of error.", "This CapEx purchasing model can be simpler and easier for the buyer, but leads to inefficiency and extra cost.", "In addition, when comparing cloud and on-premises costs, customers need to include on-premises costs for data center space, electricity, power and cooling, and data center manpower, which may not be in their budget even though these costs are paid for by another unit’s budget in their organization.", "[82]. The history of IT shows that customer owned and operated IT creates strong pressures to customize IT, since IT leaders work for the business and IT’s purpose is to support the business.", "And that has led to expensive, brittle, complex custom deployments that are hard to manage and modernize.", "More fundamentally, customization aside, on-premises deployments lack the cloud’s scale, automation, and economics, and draw the business back into areas that are not their core competency.", "See section V in “Where Cloud Computing Excels” for more.", "[83].

But I’d say that Prime Video had the single best series performance (The Wheel of Time) whereas Disney had the best combined performance (Hawkeye and The Beatles: Get Back).", "With The Wheel of Time, Prime Video has a legitimate hit on their hand. Globally, Amazon said it was their biggest hit of the year (not surprising) and their fifth biggest launch of all time (somewhat surprising).", "Since we know The Boys season 2 had 14.9 million viewers in its first weekend, presumably that means four other shows bested The Wheel of Time.", "(Maybe The Boys season 1, The Grand Tour, Marvelous Mrs. Maisel, Jack Ryan or some other series.)", "At 19.4 million hours in its first weekend, that’s a great number for a season one launch. Specifically, the 9th highest of the 99 season one launches in my data set.", "Considering that Netflix releases binge releases its series, and Prime Video (wisely in my opinion) is releasing this series weekly, scoring in the top ten in its first week is a big launch.", "Long term, if I had to raise a concern, it would be its 7.3 on IMDb, the show is only “so-so” in terms of ratings.", "Especially for a fantasy series.

Clearly, it over-indexed on “the conversation”, but it also delivered the goods, with 8.4 million hours viewed.", "That leaves Netflix. True Story did fine, though, getting 15.7 million hours over the holiday weekend for Netflix.", "Given that The Wheel of Time and Hawkeye did about the same with many fewer episodes, I’d call the series a solid double for Netflix (especially given the talent attached).", "The other two launches for Netflix feel like true misses. Cowboy Bebop was a big, likely expensive adaptation, and it only netted 6.9 million hours in its debut, good for 46th place in all season 1 launches this year.", "Not great and hence, it’s already been cancelled.

Tiger King 2 released on Netflix on Wednesday 17-Nov to 11.4 million hours, then dropped to 8 million hours in its second week, and then fell off the ratings charts.", "That’s a big fall for a series I called the most popular show of 2020. Its sophomore outing utterly failed to resonate.", "It’s second week in 2020, for context, had 89 million hours. Over 11 times as much. The lesson, if we must take one, is that virality is a fickle mistress.", "(And that we were all super bored during the first Covid lockdowns.)", "– As I hinted at last issue, I was waiting for Ted Lasso to drop off the list to put its run in context.", "Well, sure enough, it’s off the list. We don’t have time for a deep dive today, but I’ll try to write one in the future after we catch up with the December ratings.", "– Netflix released the South Korean series Hellbound on 19-Nov, and it seemed to have an okay global response.", "A new Squid Game this is not; it earned 4.5 million hours viewed in its first week, then it dropped off the list.", "Remember, for every Squid Game, you’ll have quite a few Hellbounds. But that’s okay! That’s why TV is a “portfolio business”: the success of Squid Game will pay for quite a few bombs.", "– This week, I’ve been incorporating TV Time’s weekly release of their top shows on streaming. (Their methodology is a bit opaque, but it’s derived from customers using their app to find where shows are streaming.)", "This is cool, since TV Time covers all streaming, meaning we will have a more reliable data source to judge shows on platforms like Peacock, Paramount+ or HBO Max, which don’t let Nielsen release their data.", "For example, on 18-Nov, Paramount+ released season four of Star Trek: Discovery. (So technically part of our Thanksgiving show down.)", "Since we don’t know Nielsen ratings, we don’t know quite how well it did, but it has been a staple on the TV Time ratings, for six weeks for total score of 23, good for 7th overall going back to the start of November.", "– “Dog Not Barking” of the Week: Arcane. As we mentioned before, the anime series Arcane is based on the wildly popular global video game, League of Legends.", "And while the series has done fine globally for Netflix, in the U.S. we can officially say it flopped, having never made the Nielsen top ten lists in its three weeks of releasing episodes three at a time.", "Even the non-Nielsen rankings aren’t great for Arcane, with it only appearing on the Netflix Top Ten list and the TV Time rankings for 2 weeks, respectively.", "(And yes, combined with Cowboy Bebop, is this evidence that anime isn’t coming to devour the world? Yes, yes it is.)", "– In addition to Arcane, a few other titles have the (in)distinction of missing the Nielsen ratings charts including Marvel’s Hit Monkey and The Great on Hulu, The Line from Apple TV+, The World According to Jeff Goldblum on Disney+ and F is For Family on Netflix.", "For non-Nielsen tracked services, Paramount+ had Real World Homecoming: Los Angeles, Peacock had a new season of Saved by the Bell and HBO Max had Gossip Girl as “dogs not barking”.", "A few of these seem like shows that the streamers needed to work. If I had to draw a lesson, it really is that “peak TV” means a lot of shows will fail to launch.", "The big streaming release in the middle of November—besides Red Notice—was HBO Max’s King Richard, the second to last film in HBO Max’s forced march to insist on releasing everything in theaters and streaming simultaneously.", "Like The Beatles: Get Back, this one seemed to have some social media buzz, but as we’ve seen that doesn’t necessarily lead to huge ratings.", "Samba TV has provided Deadline (and me) with the number of households who tuned in during each dual-release film’s opening weekend, and King Richard was near the end of the pack:", "Looking at the TV Time data, King Richard ranked fourth in its first week and fifth in its second weekend, behind genre blockbusters like Red Notice, Shang-Chi and Jungle Cruise.", "And then it drops off after that. So most signs pointing to this film being an aggressively fine launch.", "For an Oscar contending title, though, that’s not a terrible outcome.", "– Well, Red Notice held up great in the Nielsen ratings. It’s 28.5 million hours in its second week of release is the 20th highest single week total of the year and with 75.1 million hours viewed in its first three weeks it’s the highest film through three weeks, beating Luca (74.1 million hours) and Soul (58.9 million hours).", "This is a huge hit for Netflix. (But you probably already knew that.)", "– Black Widow finally fell off the Nielsen charts after lasting for 6 weeks when it came to Disney+’s SVOD side of the house.", "It finished with 2.8 million hours in a row for its last three weeks before succumbing to Moana and Luca over Thanksgiving weekend.", "– You’re probably wondering about all the Christmas films making the list. Me too! I’ll write about that in the next issue.", "– Here’s a fun one. On 18-Nov, Peacock released a third Psych film called Psych 3: This is Gus. Normally, I’d call this a “dog not barking” and move on.", "But it made the tenth place spot for one week in the TV Time rankings. That’s about as low as you can get and not get labelled a flopl, but at least it’s something.", "– So what is the “dog not barking” of the week? To keep their streak going, Prime Video released Burning, a documentary on the Australian wildfires.", "But documentaries are cheap. Instead, I’d look to the musical Tick, Tick…BOOM, from Lin Manuel Miranda released on Netflix 19-Nov. That’s pretty good creative auspices to miss the rankings entirely.", "And guess what? I’ll have more to say on this topic too in a future article.", "To put all these streaming ratings in context, it’s worth noting that when broadcast TV does its thing, it still delivers.", "Take the run of big events on broadcast TV. Starting with Adele, you had 10.3 million viewers tune in for her show on the first day.", "The Macy’s Day Parade followed that up with 25.4 million viewers for its three hour telecast. And the biggest NFL game of Thanksgiving pulled in 37.8 million viewers, the best single regular season game since 1993.", "In other words, in one day, broadcast delivered three shows that clearly would have topped the streaming ratings, which are mostly three day ratings.", "As I said in the introduction, we still have a ton of data to parse. Next week, we’ll look into the coming deluge of Christmas and Holiday themed movies, from Home Alone and Elf to A Boy Called Christmas and A Castle for Christmas.", "Basically, Christmas films will replace a lot of Disney animated titles for December.", "On the TV side, Netflix returns with Lost in Space, a show we haven’t had data for in the past, and the latest season of Money Heist.", "(Which continues to underwhelm in the U.S.) Hulu has PEN15—which I’m not optimistic for—and Prime Video will drop the last season of The Expanse—and I’m not optimistic for that either.", "(As always, sign up for my newsletter to get all my columns, streaming ratings reports, and articles in your inbox.)"]}

For example, in the United Kingdom, government has taken steps towards limiting food and beverage exposure towards children, while any regulation in the USA is essentially non-existent(43).", "Regulations towards marketing unfortunately lag far behind new forms of technology and media, and those that do exist are aimed towards television advertisements, despite research that suggests that

that a large percentage of viewers is younger than these reported statistics.", "Additionally, livestreaming on many ‘mature’ platforms can be viewed without needing an active account by simply passing a self-reported age-check question.", "Even when disregarding these issues, the high prevalence of young viewership is concerning, as evidence suggests that children are not fully aware of the persuasive intent of marketing and tend to accept advertising as truthful, accurate and unbiased(46,47).", "The evidence base on the impact of advertising exposure among youth is large and growing,

platforms.", "Evidence suggests that alcohol advertising and promotion may increase the likelihood that adolescents will start to use alcohol, and that those who begin drinking as an adolescent are more likely to experience alcohol dependence later in life(51,52).", "Therefore, present work highlights a need to include new forms of media and marketing (including livestreaming) in future conversations regarding regulation of food, beverage and alcohol marketing and to more fully examine the effects of marketing on adolescents, which has been a traditionally understudied group in the food marketing literature(53).", "This study drew its strengths from its novel comparison of brand exposure across multiple popular livestream platforms, yet it is not without limitations.", "First, we were only able to analyse hours watched as they related to stream titles, while previous work allowed us a more comprehensive view of the advertising on the entire platform (such as streamer profiles).", "While stream titles and hours watched are able to capture a broad view of brand exposure, livestreaming platforms are abundant with other types of simultaneous brand exposure such as video ads, banner ads, overlay ads, product placements and promotional giveaways, to name a few.", "Therefore, companies have the ability to simultaneously advertise in a number of different ways on livestreaming platforms, which then may spread onto other social media accounts managed by the streamer and their team.", "These multiple types of advertising and their potential widespread reach may work synergistically to increase brand recall, positive brand attitude and actual purchasing or food choice behaviour, and future work is needed to fully explore these potential synergistic relationships.", "Therefore, the results presented here are likely a conservative estimate of the true amount of brand exposure on these platforms as we only accounted for the use of food and beverage brands or products in stream titles, and did not account for other potential accompanying marketing tactics.", "Second, our analysis was not restricted to including the disclosure of an advertising campaign through the use of hashtag (#) indicators such as ‘#ad’ or ‘#sponsored’.", "This was a conscious choice, as limiting the search to hashtag indicators would have caused us to miss naturally

For one, my experience is that openness and candour can work with any workforce, not just with an elite of highly talented individuals.", "As Reed admits himself, a framework and training is essential to make this work well, and that goes for any group of employees.", "Secondly, as Buurtzorg and others prove on a day to day basis, even in non-creative yet high-risk and complex environments, there are strong arguments for reducing ‘rules and process’ and trusting and supporting the workforce instead.", "Alternative controls and providing the right context often produce better outcomes than control proxies and best-practice straight-jackets.", "Finally, with ‘trust’ being the essential ingredient for any concept of self-management, I do wonder how well that fits with Netflix’ Keeper Test.", "It seems to work for them, but I would warn against it being adopted by your average company that lacks the foundation and organisational learning that Netflix built up over many years.", "All in all this book is a must-read for any progressive business leader.

Dispassionate sackings. “Sunshining” failure.

That’s not a personal assessment, but the warning I receive in advance of our chat.", "If I’m planning to thaw him out, his handlers urge, I should make sure I’ve read his new book – No Rules Rules – about the somewhat terrifying workplace culture Hastings created at global streaming giant Netflix, a company governed by such ominous slogans as Adequate performance gets a generous severance package and its blunter corollary, Fire loudly, and with clarity.", "Apparently a few journalists didn’t read his corporate leadership tome in advance, and consequently got a cool reception from the author.", "The book is intriguing – from the radical candour feedback mechanisms the company uses, to the transparency process known as sunshining – but it’s just one source of research into the 59-year-old chief executive and co-founder of one of the biggest entertainment platforms on the planet.", "All of which makes the forewarning I receive curious.", "I’ve never been cautioned before an interview to do my homework: “Have you read the book?” I’ve never been given interview tips from a PR: “You might want to open with a few questions about the culture.”", "And I’ve definitely never been implicitly advised not to be late: “Punctuality is really important to him.”", "We’ll have only 45 minutes to talk, too – a limited window that the “intense” Hastings might (but probably won’t) stretch.", "In the end, following a digital diary snafu, I’m granted the barest half-hour.", "Hastings hates these things. He has ever since he sold his first venture – a software debugging company in the mid-1990s – and was featured in USA Today, photographed on the bonnet of a new Porsche Carrera under the headline “Boom!", "You are rich!” (Great headline though, he’d have to concede.) He told Vanity Fair in 2012 exactly how he felt about personality", "profiles: “I hate the photo shoots. I hate all that stuff. It’s an appropriate and necessary sacrifice, but on a personal basis, it’s pure downside, because then you just get more recognised.", "A normal life is unlikely for Hastings.

He’s already pivoted from DVD rentals to streaming, from local to global, from licensing to producing, helping bankrupt the Blockbuster video behemoth along the way.", "And he’s not just a tech nerd or C-suiter but a political animal, too, whether backing his favourite politicians (tipping in dollars as a “Hillblazer” for Hillary Clinton in 2016; co-hosting a fund-raiser last year for Democratic wunderkind Pete Buttigieg) or pouring his philanthropic bucks into an ailing US education system he thinks could use a little disruption.", "Let’s not forget his net worth, either.

His father was a lawyer, his grandfather on his mother’s side a renowned physicist.", "“But I was definitely not a stand-out kid; I was a late bloomer,” he says. “All through high school, a B student.", "Not an athlete, not that social, but I wasn’t super dark and miserable.”", "In 1978 he went to Bowdoin College, a small nearby liberal arts school, where he discovered an aptitude for mathematics.", "He loved being great at something, fell particularly hard for self-paced classes, and has said that “calculus was my first binge”.", "He once told The New Yorker he had no hobbies and was a “pitiful failure as a Renaissance man”, yet he had an intrepid streak at university, running the Outing Club, organising hikes and canoeing trips.", "He spent one summer in a Marine Corps boot camp, too, before ultimately joining the Peace Corps – teaching maths to teenagers in Swaziland.", "It felt purposeful and worthy, at least at first. In his second year in Africa he spent his afternoons playing cards and drinking beer.", "Letters from that time – archived at his alma mater – reflect a growing sense of stagnation: “I would never dribble away my days at home like this.”", "He began to consider studying artificial intelligence at graduate school. “I loved the kids, but I wanted more intellectual stimulation than teaching algebra every year,” he says.", "His big lucky break was getting into the master’s of computer science program at Stanford University in 1985, after which “life took off”.", "In 1991 he started his own software debugging company, which merged with a similar company founded by his friend Marc Randolph.", "Randolph currently works as a mentor to the founders of new start-ups but has another claim to fame as the original Netflix CEO.", "The first time he truly met Hastings was a week after their companies joined, on a flight from Los Angeles to New York.", "“Within three minutes of the stewardess bringing around the peanuts and the soft drinks, Reed swivels 90 degrees in his seat, leans in, and starts on this incredible dissection of the business, of the category, of the competition, of the challenges they were facing,” Randolph tells me, on a video chat from Silicon Valley.", "“This thing went on for five hours. It was the most incredible synopsis I’ve seen. He was not someone to spend half the flight chit-chatting about sports.”", "Eventually their combined company was acquired by another for $US750 million. “We were both out of a job,” Randolph says, “but in that wonderful Silicon Valley way where you stay on for six months to advise.”", "The pair would carpool into the office for an hour each day – rides that became brainstorming sessions about their next business.", "Considering the success of Amazon with books, they wondered if it could work for videos. This was the summer of 1996, and Hastings was fuming over $40 in late fees after renting the Tom Hanks movie Apollo 13.", "DVDs were being test-marketed in a number of cities, and a light bulb went off: could this thinner, lighter format be rented cheaply by mail, instead of forcing customers to line up at the local video shop?", "They went to a music store in Santa Cruz and bought a used Patsy Cline CD, then mailed the disc to Hastings’ house in a square blue greeting card envelope.", "A day later, Hastings came to pick Randolph up for work, with the envelope in hand. “He didn’t even need to say anything,” says Randolph.", "“That was the moment we said, ‘Huh, this just might work.’ ”", "Netflix opened in 1997, and its rental model began its irresistible creep across the country. Customers could curate a queue of films online, and Netflix would post them one at a time (with no late fees).", "It sounds quaint now, but was a massive disruption then, and hugely popular.", "Hastings was already looking beyond. Ted Sarandos, his current co-CEO, remembers meeting him in San Jose in 1999, and listening to a lengthy dissertation on Moore’s Law: the theory of exponential growth in computing power.", "“Reed was talking about how all filmed entertainment would one day be delivered directly into homes through the internet.", "That was a very abstract idea back then!” says Sarandos. “I’d never met anybody like him.”", "It’s worth pointing out that Hastings was not sold on life as an entrepreneur. He was actually wrestling with the idea of an advanced degree in education to reform that field.", "“He was not someone who was dreaming about miniscule tweaks, but substantive changes,” Randolph notes.", "“He used to say to me, ‘If you really want to change the world, you’re not gonna do it with millions, or even tens of millions – you’re gonna do it with hundreds of millions.", "Netflix never completely drew Hastings away from education. He remained a California State Board of Education member, campaigning for charter schools (independent schools with specialist curricula and fewer regulations).", "In 2016 he created the Hastings Fund – $US100 million for various education programs – and in June this year he donated $US120 million for scholarships at two historic black colleges and the United Negro College Fund.", "He’s now building a conference centre for educators near the Rocky Mountains, to provide public school teachers with a space for training and leadership courses.", "I wonder if he sees the disconnect between his passion and his business – the latter encouraging people to “Netflix and chill”?", "One of his favourite jokes is that Google co-creator Larry Page is trying to make the world more productive, while Hastings is trying to make it less productive.", "He laughs. “People need learning and work, but they also need great release,” he says. “We want to win your preference with something that can move you to laughter, move you to fear.", "It’s that emotional stimulation. You’ve still gotta work, you’ve gotta eat, you’ve gotta have social relationships.", "“He is not a naturally empathetic guy. He’s not a bad person – he just doesn’t feel what others feel.”", "As the company scaled, he needed to evolve as boss. Patty McCord, who was chief talent officer at Netflix for 14 years, remembers him leading at first like a software engineer, blissfully unaware of the gravity his passing opinions might hold.", "“I had to remind Reed, ‘You know when you casually walked by and made that comment about how you would do the font on the homepage differently?", "You just redirected the entire design team to redo the website.’ ”", "There was an acknowledged bluntness in his manner – “You can always know where you stand with Reed,” says McCord, “but you might want to be sitting” – that was never more true than in 2001, just after the first dotcom bubble burst.", "Netflix wasn’t yet listed on the US stock exchange (that would come the following year) but it was losing millions due to rising expansion costs.", "It had to lay off around 40 employees, a third of its staff.", "Randolph says it was wrenching, but Hastings was dispassionate. “He is not a naturally empathetic guy,” says Randolph.", "“He’s not a bad person – he just doesn’t feel what others feel. The dominant mode for him is, ‘It would be irrational for us to keep someone on, just to keep us from hurting them.’ ”", "That mindset was franked by what happened after the sackings. The remaining 80 workers adjusted, and the office became a passionate, buzzing hive.", "Hastings calls this his “road to Damascus” experience, informing the creation of what the company calls the Keeper Test, which requires all managers to ask: Which of my people, if they told me were leaving for a similar job at a peer company, would I fight hard to keep?", "These were the beginnings of the Netflix culture deck, Freedom and Responsibility, written by Hastings with McCord over a decade.", "Initially used to orient new employees to the company, eventually Hastings shared its methodology more widely – much more widely.", "“You did what?!” McCord screamed at the time. “We’re going to scare off all our candidates!” Hastings’ reply: “Only the ones we don’t want.”", "The 126-slide presentation went viral. Facebook chief operating officer Sheryl Sandberg later said it may well be “the most important document ever to come out of the Valley”.", "It became a recruiting tool, and the cultish personality of the company was born. Its workplace wouldn’t be a “family”, for instance, but something closer to a professional sports team.", "“I just started pushing that metaphor,” says McCord. “If you’re my centre forward and there’s a better one out there, I have to do the right thing and hire them instead.”", "Radical candour was next, namely the directive that workers should Only say about someone what you will say to their face.", "Personal feedback was instilled into everything, becoming an agenda item on every meeting, not to mention Live 360s, sessions in which a group gives an individual a thorough round of (constructive) criticism.", "“There’s definitely a tension between kindness and honesty,” says Hastings, nodding. “We humans want both to be kind and to be honest, and you try to do the best job of being both, but it’s hard …", "But I don’t want to soften a message so much that it’s not heard accurately.”", "He says the feedback is bottom-up as well as top-down, but I struggle to imagine how that works. Underlings don’t often critique the head of a $US200 billion global company.", "Hastings says psychological rewards are crucial – tough feedback must be met with immediate thanks. “And it gets easier.", "Think about it like exercise – if you don’t exercise a lot, then you try to bike up a mountain, it really is awful, you feel sick.", "But if you work out a bunch, you know you’re getting stronger and you push yourself. I’m not saying it doesn’t hurt sometimes, but it can be a productive hurt.”", "It provoked an unprecedented customer revolt. Almost a million subscribers left. Employees quit in droves.", "The company rose, introducing streaming in 2007 before its competitors, and when Apple launched the first iPad in 2010, Netflix was one of its featured apps.", "But the upstart company was also openly disparaged. Time Warner chief executive Jeff Bewkes infamously sneered about it to The New York Times: “It’s a little bit like, is the Albanian Army going to take over the world?", "I don’t think so.” (Hastings wore that slight, quite literally: “For the next year, I wore Albanian Army dog tags around my neck,” he said at the time.", "Unfortunately, a debacle of his own making was close, the result of what people say is both his greatest strength and greatest weakness.", "“For Reed, if the instinct and the data is there, the decision doesn’t need to be worried about,” says McCord.", "And that’s what happened in 2011. Hastings decided to halve the company: Netflix would do streaming, and a new service, Qwikster, would handle its DVD rentals.", "Instead of a single $US10 per month fee, it would charge $US8 for each service (a six-dollar price hike overall).", "It provoked an unprecedented customer revolt. Almost a million subscribers left. Employees quit in droves.", "The Netflix stock price dropped by 75 per cent. Hastings jumped online to explain: “I messed up,” he wrote.", "“I offer my sincere apology.” There was a ham-fisted video apology, too, mocked by Conan O’Brien and spoofed on Saturday Night Live.", "An unmitigated disaster, Qwikster was hastily withdrawn.", "Erin Meyer, the co-author of No Rules Rules, knows precisely why the episode played out this way. “Reed’s very, very smart, and he’s right most of the time, and he gets ahead of people, and he will cut short a discussion and be impatient about waiting for people to catch up with him,” says Meyer, speaking from Milwaukee.", "“Qwikster is the people around him thinking, ‘He must be able to see things we can’t see.’ ”", "A chastened Hastings began using the words “probation” and “penalty box” to describe his status in the company.", "He took a team of 60 executives and directors on retreat to a Colorado ranch, where they sat in a circle sharing the lessons learned.", "“We were very much in the middle of nowhere, there’s cliffs and cowboy-type stuff around, and you’ve spent the four days together arguing about all sorts of things, and this was the summary moment,” Hastings tells me.", "“We’re kind of half-recovered, but we’re still fragile. I thanked everyone for managing their own anger – they must have been angry at me.”", "Then he broke down, tearful for their support. And managers came forward, confessing they knew Qwikster would flop but hadn’t plucked up the courage to challenge him.", "From then on, another mantra was nailed to the wall: If you disagree with a Netflix idea and do NOT express that disagreement, you are being disloyal to the company.", "They now test out new plans by casually socialising ideas with peers, or actively farming for dissent.", "If something fails, they work on sunshining that mistake: explaining what happened and why, so everyone learns.", "(They even keep a file of historic follies to show new employees.)", "Transparency became king, often at the expense of privacy. When someone is fired, for instance, they can’t say they quit, and staff are told why.", "Personal problems like alcoholism are shielded from peers, but never performance issues.", "They hold weekly “all hands” meetings, too, where they share detailed company information, from high-level strategy to valuable quarterly financial information – data that could be illegally traded upon.", "It’s a risk, admits Hastings, but the reward is staff who feel trusted. In the book, he offers a memory hinting at why he went down this road.", "He was 19, and his college roommate opened up about being a virgin. Hastings was, too, but said nothing, later learning how his silence had hurt his friend.", "“Keeping secrets,” he now writes, “is not good business.”", "As Netflix went global, the company rules had to be adapted. Copious positive feedback smacks of insincerity to Germans, while bald negative feedback can be insulting to the highly indirect Japanese.", "Hastings seems well equipped to face the world. He tells a story about his time in Swaziland. It was 1983, and he set a problem for his 16-year-old students.", "A room measures two metres by two metres: how many 50-centimetre tiles would it take to cover the floor?", "None could answer. Hastings grew frustrated. Then a boy, Thabo, raised his hand: “Mr Hastings, sir, please, what is a tile?”", "His students had grown up with dirt floors. “That lesson in that moment taught me so much. I’m more thoughtful than I would be otherwise about context,” he says.", "“When someone doesn’t get something, I don’t go to, ‘They’re not smart.’ I think, ‘What am I not explaining right?’ ”", "He’s needed that perspective when it comes to content, too. Netflix began expanding overseas in 2010, first in Canada.", "In 2011, it went into Latin America. From 2012 it moved into Europe and, in 2015, Australia and the Asia Pacific.", "In 2016 it made its platform available in 130 new countries in one day. This naturally led to concerns about homogenisation of culture – about the rest of the world taking their cultural cues from American programming.", "In fairness, the company now produces content in 20 countries, including some of its biggest recent hits, from Dark (Germany) to Money Heist (Spain).", "Hastings foreshadows a day when that great historic obstacle to big audiences watching foreign content – the subtitle – may no longer be needed.", "“I think most of the future will be dubbing,” he predicts. “Think of deep fake technology, and getting lip synch to be better so you don’t even notice.”", "That’s not really a concern in Australia, of course, where former ABC executive producer Que Minh Luu has just been appointed the first “director of local originals”.", "She’s only been in the gig two months, but knows what she wants. “It’s gotta be Australian, it’s gotta have an Australian point of view, and it’s gotta be for Australian audiences,” Luu says.", "“If it travels, great, but the remit is very much sitting in the local space – making stories by us for us.”", "Exactly how many stories is the question people are asking. Free-to-air broadcasters in Australia are compelled to screen a hard quota of local content, but Netflix has banded together with competitors Amazon, Disney and Stan (owned by Nine, the publisher of Good Weekend) in lobbying the federal government to let them negotiate confidential voluntary targets instead.", "Resisting a hard quota, Netflix likes to point out it has already invested $110 million in Australian children’s programming in four years (from The Inbestigators to Bottersnikes & Gumbles), as well as making “invisible investment” in adult shows co-produced with local networks (such as ABC programs The Letdown and Pine Gap), plus “unscripted” content such as comedian Hannah Gadsby’s smash stand-up special Nanette.", "“We’re producing great content without a quota now – it feels really positive and assertive,” says Luu.", "“People are actively curious about what we want to do and what we want to make, and the message going back is, ‘What story do you want to tell that you haven’t been able to tell before?’ ”", "For the talented Tony Ayres (screenwriter and showrunner, director and producer), that story is the social media thriller Clickbait.", "Ayres took it to buyers in Los Angeles last year, where Netflix used its formidable clout to “blow everyone else out of the water”.", "In production now, the $54 million project is his first Netflix Original, but he points out that other Australian shows such as Glitch would never have happened without co-production investment from Netflix.", "The streamer also recently licensed a handful of shows Ayres has worked on in the past, from Stateless and Wanted to Nowhere Boys, getting them into the once notoriously inaccessible American market, and beyond.", "“It’s satisfying to have another door to knock on, and then when you go through that door it’s a little like, ‘We’re not in Kansas anymore’,” Ayres says.", "Not everyone is happy to let streaming services dictate how much local content they produce. Communications Minister Paul Fletcher will answer the quota question later this year, promising that “harmonisation” measures will be rolled out slowly, after he reveals a rough direction for any new laws.", "That can’t come soon enough for legendary Australian producer John Edwards (Tangle, Love My Way), who says access to our market must come with a cost.", "“That’s the quid pro quo, and it’s served us very, very well,” Edwards says. “There would have been no Offspring without a quota.", "There would have been no Secret Life of Us without a quota. It goes on and on – great Australian shows that were only made because the buggers had to make something Australian.", "“Think about it, when you watch a show from Netflix and you get addicted to it, you stay up late at night.", "This is all going on, of course, in the shadow of the COVID pandemic. With much of the world facing no concerts, closed movie theatres and shuttered plays, millions are stuck at home, glued to the telly, so it’s no surprise that Netflix added more than 10 million new subscribers worldwide between April and June this year.", "Its production pipeline briefly stalled, but because it works so far in advance – sometimes years – and shutdowns have varied throughout the world (Western Europe is back in full-blown production; Korea and Iceland didn’t shut at all), the impact will be minimal.", "The other backdrop, of course, is the “streaming wars”. Netflix is the global default leader but not in every locale.", "In India, for instance, its five million subscribers badly trails both Amazon (17 million) and Disney+ Hotstar (18 million).", "In Australia, according to technology analysts Telsyte, Netflix has 5.4 million subscriptions, Stan 2.1 million, Amazon’s Prime Video 1.7 million, and Disney+ 1.1 million.", "Each has its own strategy. Stan entered the market first and pushed local content hard. Next was Amazon, its Prime Video tapping into a sports-mad nation with its cricket docuseries, The Test, and embedding film crews with AFL clubs.", "Last year came Disney+, which relies on its massive back catalogue while also owning or buying the rights to one-off “event” programming such as the hit American stage show Hamilton.", "Local TV networks are improving their own streaming apps, too, from ABC iView to Foxtel Go.", "With a glut of providers, Sydney media analyst Peter Cox warns that casualties are coming. “The fundamentals don’t add up,” Cox says.", "“You need to dominate the market share and make a monopoly product – and these companies aren’t achieving that.", "It will be a battle. There will be a lot of money lost in the process. The bottom line is we’ll end up with blood on the carpet.”", "I’ve seen this kind of analysis put to Hastings in the past. His response never varies. Netflix may have spent $US2 billion on marketing this year, but he doesn’t see it as competing with Apple TV or YouTube Premium or Fortnite, but a much greater foe, which he identified to investors in 2017.", "“Think about it, when you watch a show from Netflix and you get addicted to it, you stay up late at night,” Hastings said.", "Thirty-five years ago, Wilmot Reed Hastings jnr wrote a wistful letter home, as his time in Swaziland came to a close: “Will I ever again race across the hot savannah, bare chested, motorcycle purring, admiring the acacia trees heralding ‘This is Africa?’", "People now wonder if he has a similar bittersweet yearning – for a life untethered to work. Sarandos was appointed co-CEO earlier this year, so the retirement question keeps coming.", "“No, not yet!” he pleads. “I’m here for another decade at least and couldn’t be more excited about what we can accomplish around the world.”", "Yet he has paused to smell the odd rose, joking with friends that his work life is now cutting ribbons and kissing babies.", "He’s softened. He still charges wildly into conversations, but apologises readily and without qualification.", "When he goes to the Sundance Film Festival, he doesn’t wheel and deal and gladhand, but watches movies from 8am to midnight.", "Once obsessive about the perfect 26-second espresso shot, he now values the simplicity of a house wine with a bowl of penne.", "What then disturbs his calm – what could disrupt the disruptor? Virtual reality technology perhaps – or screens embedded into contact lenses?", "“The main risk is taking things for granted,” he says. “You may not know what the threat is, but there’s always threats out there.”", "Focusing on his subscribers from all over the world is all he and his company can do. The lofty goal isn’t winning the commercial war, he says, but trying to end our prevailing human afflictions.", "Seriously. Reed Hastings wants to end boredom and loneliness. “That’s hard though,” he says, laughing.", "“We’ll see what we can do but those are very resistant conditions!”", "Time almost up, there’s a final question I can’t resist asking: When is the next season of Stranger Things coming out?", "His answer is what you might expect from a man with only 30 minutes to spare. “I’m happy to share that with you but … sorry, have to run now.”", "To read more from Good Weekend magazine, visit our page at The Sydney Morning Herald, The Age and Brisbane Times."]}

In 2009, Reed posted this culture deck, which up until that point had been internal, publicly online.", "And it caught fire. It has now been viewed tens of millions of times. And one of those tens of millions of views … was me.", "ALEX: I’m really excited to talk to you because I -- you know, five years ago I started my own company after not ever having done anything like that for my whole life.", "And ah… and our company has gone through and is in the midst of some growing pains that I feel like your very famous culture deck identifies perfectly.", "So I can’t wait to talk to you about that experience for you and the experience for us.", "PATTY: Yeah, we get an interview and a free consultation session, this works out great.", "ALEX: Exactly! You figured it out. In fact there is no podcast, it’s all a ruse.", "I’m very excited to bring you my conversation with Patty McCord. We get deep into the ideas that she layed out in the culture deck later in the episode.", "But we started at the beginning. Before the culture deck, before Patty was an HR maverick. Back when she was an HR traditionalist, in the ‘80s, when she had a succession of jobs at big technology companies.", "She worked as a recruiter, she headed diversity programs for Sun Microsystems.", "And then in the early ‘90s she was looking around for a new job. Something exciting, with a little more promise.", "And she found out that a colleague of hers had gone to a start-up that was run by an impressive young CEO… Patty wanted in.", "PATTY: I said, \"You know, you should hire me to run H.R. for that company.\" And he said, there's nothing I can do about it.", "The CEO's name is Reed Hastings.\" And I hung up the phone. And back in those days what you did was you dialed *69", "PATTY MCCORD: So it redialed, and Reed's sister who was the receptionist answered the phone, and I said, \"May I speak to Reed Hastings?\"", "ALEX BLUMBERG: Did she connect you to Reed Hastings?", "PATTY MCCORD: I said, \"You don't know me but you should, because I'm going to be -- I'm going to run H.R. for you.\"", "And he said, \"Fine. Then, you know, get an appointment. Talk to you later.\" And when I had my interview with Reed, he asked me about what my H.R. philosophy was.", "And remember at the time, I spoke fluent H.R. I mean, I'd worked at Sun Microsystems.", "ALEX BLUMBERG: And Sun Microsystems was, like, how many employees? That was like thousands of employees?", "ALEX BLUMBERG: So you were running big corporate ...", "PATTY MCCORD: Big corporate H.R., right? And so I said something like, \"You know Reed, I believe that it's -- it's of huge importance for each individual to draw a line to the corporate vision by being empowered and engaged,\" and whatever.", "And he looked at me and he said, \"Do you people even speak English? Did that sentence make any sense to anyone on the planet?\"", "And I got riled up and I said, \"Well you know, you don't know me. What a dumb question to ask about my philosophy…”", "ALEX BLUMBERG: Wait, so you fought back with him though, in that moment? You were like ...", "ALEX BLUMBERG: And you're calling my answer stupid? I'm going to call your question stupid.", "PATTY MCCORD: I was like, you know, \"Ask me a better question then, if you want a better answer.\" And so I came home and my husband said, \"How did it go?\"", "And I said, \"Well you know, I kind of got in a fight with the CEO.\"", "Turns out, didn’t matter. Reed Hastings was impressed with Patty even though she fought with him in the interview… or maybe because she fought with him…", "Now the company that Reed Hastings was starting back then was NOT Netflix. This was the company he started before Netflix.", "It was a company called Pure Software. It was a real estate holding company. Just kidding. It was a software company.", "And Pure Software grew quickly... buying up its competitors.", "PM: Every time we acquired another company, we would double. So we were a hundred, two hundred, four hundred, eight hundred, you know, sixteen hundred.", "And that part of the story is really important, because how we operated was I would take their employee handbook and our employee handbook and I would smash it together and try and create as few policies as we could that would piss off the fewest amount of people.", "But, you know, the policy manual became two or three volumes. And we spent a whole lot of time in a whole lot of meetings discussing should our e-mail be PMcCord at, or Patty dot McCord at, or -- I mean, it was just this endless bureaucratic policy nightmare.", "ALEX BLUMBERG: Uh huh… // I’m going to ask the question you said Reed was dumb for asking… At that point had you started to -- had you started to develop a philosophy of H.R.?", "ALEX BLUMBERG: If you had to outline the philosophy of standard HR, what would that philosophy be?", "PATTY MCCORD: Well it's different in every company, but there's a baseline that says, \"We make the rules and people follow them.", "And we're in charge.\" You know, it changed over time in my H.R. career from being, \"We make the rules and people follow them,\" to \"We're protecting the company from those evil employees that might sue us,\" to, you know, the HR global initiative du jour to, \"maybe we should make them extraordinarily happy.", "Patty stayed at Pure Software, practicing standard HR and feeling a little ambivalent about it, until, eventually, after acquiring all of those other companies, it was Pure Software’s turn to get acquired.", "And an acquisition can be emotionally complicated for the company getting acquired. It can mean success, money, but also, it can be bittersweet.", "The thing we built, our baby, it has a new owner. What are saying goodbye. It can feel like a loss. But what Patty noticed, she and Reed, they had almost none of that second feeling.", "They weren’t really sad. In fact, Patty wondered at the time, why are we not sadder about this? And she noted that lack of sadness.", "And then, she moved on. She started consulting. Building herself a new career. And one day, she ran into Reed again.", "PATTY: So I'm driving in a parking lot of a strip mall here in town one day in the -- early in the morning, and I see Reed with his kids in his double stroller.", "And I said, \"What are you doing?\" And he goes, \"Well, I'm taking the kids for a walk.\" And I said, \"To OfficeMax?\"", "And he said, \"I just bought this postage meter and, you know, I found that I can mail CDs to myself and they don't break.\"", "And I said, \"What?\" And then he told me the idea of Netflix DVD-by-mail, and I really -- I remember thinking I should be nice to him, because it's a really ridiculous idea.", "PATTY MCCORD: Yeah, I know. It just -- it was just so implausible.", "ALEX BLUMBERG: If everybody else saw it, it would have happened already.", "PATTY MCCORD: Right, if it was obvious, somebody would be doing it.", "Now this, remember, was pre-high-speed internet. And back then, the way you rented movies was by going to Blockbuster.", "Remember Blockbuster… it was an actual store. You’d walk into it. They’d rent you videos that you’d play on a thing called a DVD player.", "Reed told Patty he was building a competitor to that. A movie rental company that would send you DVDs through the mail.", "He was calling it Netflix. And a short while after running into Patty in the parking lot, Reed called her and asked her to come help him build it.", "PATTY: When he called me and asked me to come to Netflix I said, \"No, it's a really dumb idea, and secondly I'm consulting now.", "I make a bunch of money. I'm home a lot. My kids know my name. I mean, why would I do this?\" And he said \"Let's create the kind of company that if it was successful we'd still want to work there.\"", "And I'm like, \"Wow! That's -- that's compelling.\" And I said, \"If we did that how would you know?\" Right?", "How would you describe it, Reed?\" And he said, \"I'd want to come in the door every day and solve these problems with these people.\"", "ALEX BLUMBERG: Oh, he would -- it would be like, I would want to come into work every day excited to solve the problems before us with the people around the table, in other words.", "PATTY MCCORD: Good. Perfect. Yes, exactly that. And so he asked me what would my, you know, my nirvana play be", "and I said, \"Wouldn't it be cool if we were a great company to be from?\" You know like, we were like an Apple or a Microsoft or, you know, whoever.", "Where you saw the name on your resume and you thought, \"Oh, that's cool. You were there.\"", "For an HR maverick in the making, it was an enticing vision. So Patty joined Reed at Netflix… And for the first couple of years, it was a scrappy little company taking scrappy measures.", "PATTY MCCORD: We literally took everybody in the company out in the parking lot every Friday, and we went through basically what was the executive dashboard, right?", "We would walk them through the P&L. We would talk about how many subscribers we had, how it was growing, how many we were acquiring, what it cost to acquire them.", "I mean, walking everybody through the metrics of the business, so...", "ALEX BLUMBERG: And you're doing this in the parking lot?", "PATTY MCCORD: Because we didn't have a room big enough for everybody to be in.", "ALEX BLUMBERG: So every Friday or whatever, you would take the whole - the whole company, which is like, what, 100 people?", "ALEX BLUMBERG: I'm just imagining you all out in the parking lot, like ...", "PATTY MCCORD: We learned later -- we learned later that, at one point Blockbuster sent spies to the -- to the other parking lot that was adjacent to listen in.", "ALEX BLUMBERG: You're like, \"Who are those people in the -- in the blue golf shirts over there?\"", "For Patty, all of it was exciting. It was a fast-growing startup… they were trying to something new. And it’s around here, in the early 2000s, that we get to the point in the story where the official seeds of what would become her masterpiece, the culture deck, get planted.", "So what happened was Netflix was growing fast… but there was a lot of bad stuff happening too.", "PATTY: The growth for, particularly in the DVD-by-mail business, the growth was killing us. It was a terrible dilemma, right?", "Where every time we acquired a new customer, we had to buy three DVDs and stamps and envelopes and pay the labor to send it to them.", "ALEX BLUMBERG: So the more customers you got, the more -- the less money you had. Like, each new customer wasn't adding to your bottom line, it was taking away from your bottom line.", "PATTY MCCORD: Yes, they did -- because it was subscription, they would add to the bottom line over time.", "PATTY MCCORD: But we had -- but because, you know, if the economics of the subscription model means that, once your base is deep enough and wide enough to sustain your growth, then it just keeps feeding the machine.", "PATTY MCCORD: But -- but we hadn't gotten to that baseline economics yet.", "PATTY MCCORD: Right? And we weren't really sure whether or not it would work. And we had a very small window to do it before we ran out of money and/or went public, whichever came first.", "ALEX BLUMBERG: Right. And so you were doing this, and your plan was to go public, and you had been building toward that, but then ...", "PATTY MCCORD: We'd been building towards that. We had been, you know, on the sidelines waiting for our IPO, and then the 2000 and, you know, September 11th happened, the economy went to hell happened, the Bay Area dotcom bubble burst.", "ALEX BLUMBERG: And so you guys were just like, \"Oh, no!\"", "PATTY MCCORD: Oh, no! Oh, no! All our plans may be up in smoke, right?", "It was time for drastic action, which meant layoffs. And as head of HR, that was Patty’s department. She started looking at the staff and figuring out who it was essential to keep, and who they could let go.", "And they had to let go of a lot of people. People who’d been there from the beginning, who’d worked hard, poured their hearts and souls into building the company.", "By the end, she’d cut a third of Netflix’s workforce. It was agonizing and painful.", "But after it was all done, Patty said she and Reed noticed something. They were getting twice as much done, with a third fewer people.", "PATTY MCCORD: Reed and I sat down together and went, \"I'm totally excited about coming to work. How about you?\"", "He's like, \"It's the most fun I've ever had. What is it?\" You know, \"What is it? What -- what -- can we -- can we write down this, what's happening here and see if we can codify this into the way we operate?\"", "ALEX BLUMBERG: So you're -- you're saying that you were -- you -- you had laid off all these employees, and then you and Reed come in and you're realizing, \"Wait.", "I like working here way better, because we're accomplishing more with fewer people.\"", "ALEX BLUMBERG: At that point, when did you start to notice at that point that the company was turning around?", "PATTY MCCORD: Oh, we could see it in the subscriber base.", "ALEX BLUMBERG: So the subscriber base, was just growing.", "PATTY MCCORD: Yeah. The subscriber base was just growing organically and exponentially. And we were making so many improvements in the service very, very rapidly.", "And we had assembled a really incredible team on both ends of the DVD-by-mail business: on the -- the web side and the people working on the personalization algorithms, and that whole software side.", "PATTY MCCORD: And we had a really brilliant team of people sort of reinventing the back-end logistics software to move DVDs through the U.S. Postal Service as efficiently as anybody on the planet.", "So things were really clicking along. And you know we used to listen to the Blockbuster earnings call on a polycom in the conference room, right?", "ALEX BLUMBERG: To listen to the Blockbuster earnings call. Your biggest -- your biggest competitor.", "PATTY MCCORD: Our biggest competitor. Who were 100 times bigger than we were at the very least, right?", "PATTY MCCORD: And some -- one analyst asked John Antioco, who's the CEO of Blockbuster, what do you think of this company Netflix?", "And he says -- he gets mad. And he goes, \"They are nothing. They are a gnat. They are nobody. People go to video stores.", "They'll never ever use this service.\" And I remember we were sitting around a table in a conference room.", "Behind this row of people is a whiteboard that shows our customer growth. And it's -- that line is just up and to the right.", "It's practically straight up. And we looked to each other realized, he doesn't know.", "PATTY MCCORD: And then -- and then, you know, internally that was a very, very difficult time because the employees were like, \"Kill them!", "Deal the death blow!\" And we were like, \"No, we gotta wait them out.\"", "PATTY MCCORD: You know, lay low, make it great, wait 'em out, you know? And that was our company mantra for a number of years.", "And that was a -- that was one of the hardest things there was to do.", "ALEX BLUMBERG: Because killing them would have been like, raise a ton of money and just, like, destroy them.", "PATTY MCCORD: Super Bowl ad. Yeah! Right? Gloat at how good we are and how bad they are. And they would have squashed us like a bug.", "Netflix of course did not get squashed like a bug. Instead, in 2002, it finally went public.", "Which put it back into the category of company that Patty had worked at earlier in her career. A big public company.", "With boards, and auditors, and of course, HR manuals, filled with HR policies.", "PATTY: Now, um, the auditors are showing up and the Sarbanes-Oxley people are showing up, and our -- the board, and everybody's saying, you know, you're going to be grown-ups now, it's time to be grown-ups.", "It's time to have policies just like grown-up companies have. Because at that point, we had sort of gotten rid of everything.", "PATTY MCCORD: And it was when, as our executive team, we started saying, \"Really? Do we really have to tell these adult, brilliant, hard-working people to ask permission to spend money?\"", "PATTY MCCORD: Do we really have to have them clock in and out, when half the time, you know, they work from home or work at night.", "PATTY MCCORD: So back up. Why are these policies in place in the first place? Because employees will screw you if you don't watch out.", "And I said, \"Well, what if I took a different tack that says they won't?\"", "PATTY MCCORD: Right? Most people don't come to work and go, \"Gonna screw my company today. How about you?\"", "PATTY MCCORD: Right? Most people come to work and go, \"I want to accomplish something I'm proud of by the end of the day.\"", "PATTY MCCORD: So if you do that, and then you follow the metrics and follow the money, then you'll find out if somebody misused the company's money or made a bad judgment call.", "PATTY MCCORD: And so rather than following the rules, you now rely on people to have maturity and good judgment.", "It’s a big ask but one that seemed worth making. And Patty and Reed started expanding on this thinking.", "Started asking this question: is it inevitable that now that Netflix is a certain size, we have to adopt the HR practices that we’re sick of?", "And so they started asking hard, foundational questions about what is in fact the role of HR, and whether there’s a different, better way to do it.", "And the asking and answering of those foundational questions, over the next 10 years, grew into the Netflix Culture Deck.", "They started reimagining all sorts of things. Vacation policy, for example. Patty and her team realized, “You know what, we don’t need to babysit employee vacation requests.", "Here’s our policy: we have unlimited vacation. You just have to use it responsibly.", "Same deal with expenses. They would no longer track expenses, and require employees to submit 8.5 x 11 sheets of paper with receipts taped on them in order to get paid back for some company expense.", "Their policy became. Use the company’s money wisely. We trust you.", "Patty and Reed continued down this path. Continued trying to build the HR practice for the company they wanted to work at.", "A company that did more and better work with fewer people. A company that had nimble teams with clear goals in front of them.", "And they soon realized that building that company meant reimagining one more thing. Something they’d come to believe standard HR did very poorly.", "Welcome back to Without Fail and my conversation with Patty McCord, the former chief talent officer at Netflix.", "The Netflix Culture Deck, the thing that Patty was putting together little by little as the company grew, it became famous when Netflix CEO Reed Hastings decided to post it online.", "He didn’t even consult Patty first. He just uploaded it, typos and all, and it became wildly popular.", "Sheryl Sandberg said it “may well be the most important document ever to come out of the Valley.”", "And there’s one section in particular that spoke to me when I read it. It starts on page 45, and it points out a dynamic that felt very familiar: as companies grow, so does their complexity, and as complexity increases, things start to feel chaotic.", "And that creates pressure to start implementing rules and procedures. So... if you’re a company that wants to grow AND wants to avoid chaos… a certain amount of corporate bureaucracy starts to feel inevitable.", "But according to Patty’s culture deck, it’s not. Companies can grow while avoiding both chaos and bureaucracy.", "They can have it all. And they can do it by hiring high-performance people. High performance people, the deck says, can operate without as many rules.", "And having a high-performing company that runs informally… that helps you attract more high-performance people, because that’s the kind of culture they like.", "And you know, that sounds great, right? But there is this one other part of it. Occasionally, as you grow, someone who started out being excellent stops being excellent.", "The person who built the brilliant prototype maybe isn’t the best at running the entire division the prototype grew into.", "And so, you have to be ready to fire people. The culture deck says that, at Netflix, they will fire people for the simple reason that they’re just not excellent enough anymore.", "Or they’re excellent at a thing that the company no longer needs.", "And this is brutal, right? Starting a startup is a foxhole experience. It feels like you're part of a family.", "And Patty knew that. And so, she and Reed, they had to come up with a new metaphor. Netflix, it wasn’t a family.", "It’s a team. A pro team, that hires and develops great players. But also, lets them go when they can no longer perform.", "Teams and families both connote cooperation and community. But unlike families, you can get cut from a team.", "And Patty, she got really good at cutting people from the team. She’s had those conversations...", "PATTY: Oh god I don’t know, I mean it goes so far back…", "ALEX: Like the first, tell me an early one where you were like “Oh my god, I have this conversation and I really don’t want to.", "PATTY MCCORD: I'll take somebody on my team, maybe. You know, somebody who worked really, really hard and sorted their resumes and made nice stacks and passed them out, and didn't really understand the technology of what they were recruiting for or the person that they were talking to.", "And when I hired them, I just need somebody to work hard and be friendly.", "PATTY MCCORD: And now I needed somebody who really needed to understand what this team was trying to build.", "And who didn't roll their eyes and go, \"Oh, God. The engineers are so weird!\" Right? I needed somebody to go, \"You know what?", "I just --\" somebody to spontaneously say to me, \"You know I did today Patty? I sat next to somebody writing code for an hour and I watched them.", "ALEX BLUMBERG: Here, I'm gonna play the role. I'm -- I'm -- I'm that person in the H.R. department that was sorting resumes.", "And you have been sort of like fearing the conversation, but knowing that it has to come.", "ALEX BLUMBERG: And you knock on my door. What do you say to me?", "PATTY MCCORD: I say, \"I think you've gotten kind of the vibe that I'm not particularly happy about the way things are going.\"", "PATTY MCCORD: Because -- oh, yeah yeah. Right. \"But I have not.\" And then I'm like, \"Okay, so I haven't been very clear about that.", "So here's the team that I'm trying to build. And I need to have people that really understand the technical people and understand what they're doing and what their timelines are, and what's important to them.", "ALEX BLUMBERG: But I do, Patty. I do. I -- I -- I've -- like, what -- what gives you the sense that I don't know that?", "PATTY MCCORD: Okay, so when you're in the engineering organization right now that you support, can you tell me what the top three technical issues that are facing them are?", "ALEX BLUMBERG: Ahh something about -- latency periods. I don't know.", "PATTY MCCORD: Okay, so tell me what latency periods are.", "ALEX BLUMBERG: But you never told me that was a problem.", "PATTY MCCORD: Okay, I'm telling you now. And I'm late, right? I need to -- I need to own -- I need to own telling you that I probably should have told you this a fair time ago.", "And we're -- I'm kind of under the gun, because we gotta hire a lot of people to solve this latency problem very quickly.", "So, if I were to start over again with you walking in the door knowing what you know, I'm not sure I'd hire you.", "Patty says that having a conversation like this, as difficult as it sounds, is way better than what she did in her previous career, in traditional HR.", "PATTY MCCORD: Let's use the example we just did. I would put you on a performance improvement plan.", "PATTY MCCORD: A 90-day performance improvement plan. And I don't really think you can do it anyway, right?", "What I really want to do is get rid of you. So every Wednesday morning at 11:00 o'clock I'm going to sit down with you and I'm gonna prove that you're incompetent in writing.", "Now every Tuesday night I'm going to drink a lot. And so are you. And by the third Tuesday night, third Wednesday morning, you're just going to start crying when you walk in the door", "and probably I will too, because it's going to be a really horrible conversation, right? So not only are you and I miserable, because we both know at some point it's a farce.", "PATTY MCCORD: But your bad performance has gone to hell, or you're trying desperately to do something that you don't know how to do.", "PATTY MCCORD: So you have three months of severance already in your pocket. Instead of wasting that three months of time for you, the person and the rest of the team...", "PATTY MCCORD: I can sit down and go, \"I got to make the call. I'm in charge, and I don't think you're going to make it.", "And I am not going to set you up to fail. And I want you to take what you've learned here and find the right job at the right place for you.", "But it's not here, okay? So let's not do this. Let's not spend the next three months doing it. Here's a check for three months' salary.\"", "PATTY MCCORD: No. No, it took me years! It took me years! I was -- I mean, I really was an H.R. professional.", "It was -- but those were like, when I started paying attention to -- I'm the one that was in all those meetings.", "PATTY MCCORD: And I'm thinking, \"Why am I lying to this person? We both know this is a game. It's so cruel.", "ALEX BLUMBERG: Is it? You've now done it both ways. You've had the experience and obviously every firing is ...", "PATTY MCCORD: So much so. So much so. Yeah, but it's -- but it's part of the whole system that I'm describing to you.", "And the bigger system says, \"Hey, you know what? Bunky, I hired you because you're an incredible builder.", "And for the past four years you have built something that will stand the test of time. You should be so proud of yourself.", "You're done. You’re done. We're not going to build another one of those.\" Right? And this new thing that we're building, you actually don't know how to do.", "But there's plenty of companies in the world who could use your expertise. Let's figure out how we do that for you.\"", "Coming up, this conversation that Patty McCord had with so many other people… someone has it with her.", "My guest, HR maverick Patty McCord, had a long run at Netflix, from 1998 until 2012. Her departure came at a pivotal moment for the company.", "Netflix had been through a bruising time where it decided to split the DVD-by-mail part of its company from its streaming business.", "In the process it hiked membership fees by 60 percent, and subscribers revolted.", "Not only that, but House of Cards was on the horizon, and that meant a new future for Netflix. The company was pivoting to become a content creator.", "And Patty… who was really good at hiring engineers… didn’t have the skillset for this new world of entertainment.", "So Reed Hastings, the CEO of Netflix, had a conversation with her.", "PATTY MCCORD: Reed did exactly what I just described to you.", "PATTY MCCORD: Right. Yeah. If I walked in the door tomorrow for the company that I'm building, would I -- would I hire you?", "Maybe. Maybe not. Right? Maybe it's time to draw a new card.", "PATTY MCCORD: Oh yeah. I mean it'd been a rough year. Yeah. So I mean, was -- is anybody completely prepared for that conversation?", "No. Was I as prepared as anybody? Yeah. Was I sad? Of course.", "ALEX BLUMBERG: Did you understand? Did you have the feelings of, like, I want to argue back with him, I want to -- I want to stop this?", "PATTY MCCORD: Of course. I'm human. I mean I remember saying to Reed, I'm like, \"What if I leave and something great happens", "and I won't be here?\" He's like, \"Something great is going to happen. You won't be here.\"", "ALEX BLUMBERG: Uh-huh. Did you know -- did you see yourself from both… the reason that I'm interested in it is this is -- there's two reasons.", "One, you are one of the very few people who has, like -- who was in the position of going through the thing that you had been on the other side of for many, many, many, many times.", "And -- and I'm just curious about, like, that perspective, as, like, somebody who both knows what's going -- knows probably exactly what Reed is going to say.", "But then, you're hearing the words instead of saying them. I'm just curious about, like, what that felt like.", "PATTY MCCORD: You know, what I was surprised by was the profound sadness that I wouldn't be part of it anymore.", "That -- that was the emotion that surprised me. Not any of the other ones: the anger and the crankiness and the fighting back and all that.", "I mean, that's just human nature, right? And we both kind of knew that was going to happen, so we just sort of had to work through that.", "ALEX BLUMBERG: Yeah. Did you think at the time that that was happening that like, \"Oh the -- the -- this -- this -- this culture that I have built is now -- has now… turned on me?", "ALEX BLUMBERG: You're like, \"Why did I ever -- why did I ever write that deck in the first place?\"", "PATTY MCCORD: No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. We -- so -- so we had a ritual, Reed and I going back forever.", "We'd take the company to Sundance and then he and I would get together and we'd have a bottle of wine together.", "Got progressively better by the way, over the years.", "PATTY MCCORD: And the conversation we would have is, you know, am I the right person for what's in front of us next year.", "And we had -- both of us had it. So very, very early on we had this conversation where he said in front of a bunch of people, \"You know, McCord, I could fire you in a hot minute,\" or something like that.", "And I brought him in a room and I said, \"Hey, newsflash. I could quit in a hot minute.\" You know, like, \"I am a professional, you know?", "You know, you're not the only game in town, and did you know it kind of hurts my feelings when you say that?\"", "And he says \"Oh, come on. Really? What hurts your feelings?\" And I'm like, \"It hurts my feelings. Makes me feel bad.\"", "And I'm talking to him -- we're having this conversation in, like, 1999.", "PATTY MCCORD: And I said, \"Really Reed, I can't imagine anything worse than, like, publicly failing.

Under one condition.\" And I'm like, \"Why is it always one condition with you?\"", "And he goes, \"You tell me.

Rational Software purchased the company in 1997, appointing Hastings as the CEO.", "At this point, Hastings knew that he didn’t want to continue down this path. He resigned from his position and spent the next two years thinking about what kind of company he should start next.", "Netflix co-founders Reed Hastings and Marc Randolph have told at least three stories about why they invented Netflix.", "The most relatable version of Netflix’s origin comes from a time when Hastings accrued a $40 late fee at a movie rental store.", "Fed up with late fees, he decided that consumers needed access to a membership rental option.", "Another story says that Hastings and Randolph struck on the idea while brainstorming concepts for a new company.", "They knew that they wanted to have a system similar to Amazon’s.", "Unlike Amazon’s goal of selling practically everything customers could want, Hastings and Randolph wanted to focus on a specific type of product.", "They decided DVDs would meet their needs well. DVDs were likely their top choice because of their lightweight, compact designs and the large number of people interested in renting them.", "A third origin story says that Hastings was inspired by a math problem developed to solve for volume and distance traveled.", "Thinking about the solution led to the idea of DVDs as the volume and distance traveled as customer locations.", "What Qualities of Charismatic Leadership Does Reed Hastings Possess?", "Hastings has several qualities that overlap with charismatic leadership styles. He’s an incredibly confident person who can communicate calmly with large groups of people.", "When the company seems to waiver, he remains steady.

The hit series House of Cards stands out as one of the most prevalent times that he used the transformational leadership style.", "Employees at Netflix developed the show long before bringing it to executives for approval.

And to do that, you have to be very intentional about how you craft the culture.", "This was exactly the lesson Reed took from Pure Software.", "HASTINGS: Well, the mistakes in Pure was that every time we had a significant error – sales call didn’t go well, bug in the code – we tried to think about it in terms of what process could we put in place to ensure that this doesn’t happen again, and thereby improving the company?", "And what we failed to understand is by dummy-proofing all the systems, that we would have a system where only dummies wanted to work there, which was exactly what happened.", "And so the average intellectual level fell, and then the market changed and we were unable to adapt to it, because we had a bunch of people who valued following the process rather than the first-principle thinking.", "HOFFMAN: Notice Reed’s double insight here. Pure Software couldn’t adapt because they had the wrong employees, and they had the wrong employees because of management decisions that explicitly selected for those employees.", "This insight catapulted Reed as he set out to build Netflix. And we’ll come back to the Netflix story in a moment.", "As we’re releasing this episode just a week after Travis Kalanick stepped down as CEO of Uber, amid a slew of controversies over the company’s culture, we thought that was worth noting.", "Reed Hastings experience at Pure Software was a relatively benign example of how company culture can go astray.", "Uber was more toxic. If you permit – or encourage – abusive, excessive or exclusionary behavior early on, it’s very hard to reverse those organizational habits.", "Our producer Dan Kedmey called Adam Grant to get his take on what happened at Uber, and what other founders could learn from it.", "Adam’s a professor at the Wharton School of Management, and author of Give and Take, and a friend. In examining the cultural collapse at Uber, Adam sees broader themes at play, beginning with the way the founders envision their role in the world:", "ADAM GRANT: I often think about people on a spectrum of givers and takers. And there’s this belief in Silicon Valley that if you want to be disruptive and you want to be sort of a CEO who drives a major innovation change then you have to be a taker.", "You look at Uber and you think, well you know they had to break all these rules, they had a fight with taxi companies, they had to, you know, sidestep laws in multiple states and countries, and you need a bunch of takers who are willing to just go in and take what they feel they deserve and what is ultimately right for their business.", "The data don’t support that story at all. It’s a giant myth. And so what you really want, if you want to drive disruption, is you want disagreeable givers.", "The people who enjoy conflict, who like to challenge the status quo and rock the boat but are motivated to do that in service of helping other people be successful or achieving a meaningful organizational goal.", "HOFFMAN: Adam’s takeaways have a lot in common with what Reed Hastings shared earlier. Great companies hinge on both the people you hire, and the culture you build to keep them.", "GRANT: I think as a founder if you’re trying to build a culture, the first thing you do is you say, “It is nice to have the right people on your bus but it is even more critical to keep the wrong people off your bus.”", "And actually Mark Chussil has a great article about this. He says we all have our “To Do” lists but we forget to make “To Don’t” lists, a list of the things that we won’t do.", "And I think that every founder should have one of these when it comes to hiring: What are the qualities that I am absolutely unwilling to let into the organization?", "DAN KEDMEY: So I’m sure we have plenty of young founders who are listening to the podcast right now. Like at what point should they start thinking about this issue?", "GRANT: Yesterday. It’s never too early to think about the culture that you’re shaping. And it’s a lot easier to shape culture through who you let in the door than through trying to radically change people’s behaviors.", "HOFFMAN: So we’ve seen two examples here of how culture can go astray. One of them, Pure Software, relatively benign.", "And one of them, Uber, rather toxic. In either case, culture sticks. And if you don’t want your company to get bogged down in corrosive or downright scandalous behavior, you have to avoid the bog to begin with.", "With the lessons of Pure Software fresh in his mind, Reed treaded carefully into the next phase of his career.", "Pure Software sold for $750 million. That gave Reed the seed money to launch Netflix in 1997. It started as a service that mailed DVDs to your door.", "And it’s easy to forget just how radically Netflix upended the video rental business from day one. No late fees.", "No extra shipping charges. Lose a DVD? Get a new one in the mail, no questions asked. Their most fearsome competitor, Blockbuster, quickly followed suit, matching service for service, but not quite fast enough.", "Blockbuster filed for bankruptcy in 2010, and shrunk from 9,000 stores at its height to roughly 10 stores today, 8 of which are reportedly in a frigid part of Alaska with sluggish internet service.", "But there’s a deeper reason Netflix was able to outmaneuver a company more than 100 times its size. It’s not a story of competition, but cooperation, a cultural flourishing that took place within Netflix’s headquarters.", "It was a culture built almost as a counterpoint to Pure Software.", "HASTINGS: We were unable to adapt to it, because we had a bunch of people who valued following the process rather than the first-principle thinking.", "HOFFMAN: A bit of background on first principle thinking – you’ll hear this expression a lot in Silicon Valley.", "First principle thinking is the idea that everything you do is underpinned by foundational beliefs – or “first principles.”", "Instead of blindly following directions, or sticking to a process, a first principle thinker will constantly ask, “What’s best for the company?", "And couldn’t we do it this other way instead?” And these are the kinds of inquisitive minds that Reed Hastings wanted to unleash on Netflix, for virtually every decision.", "HASTINGS: And so the reverse of that, which we do at Netflix, is you have to be a first principle thinker.", "There’s an overhead to that about what’s best for the company. So this is true on the broad scale, like what kind of content we do.", "It’s also true in the micro, which is, “How should I travel: Business, or coach, or by bus?”", "And we ask people to do what you would think is best for the company. We don’t give them any more guidelines than that.", "And some people that frustrates, but those are probably not the people that’s a good match for Netflix.", "And other people like this sort of first-principle thinking all the time.", "HOFFMAN: This may sound like the sort of advice a tech entrepreneur would naturally follow. Who wouldn’t want to hire a first principle thinker?", "Well, it’s easy to tell yourself that in the abstract. But when you’re running a fast-growing company, you’re also going to be telling yourself, “I desperately need a sales expert, a programmer, a designer, an accounting whiz” – and you’ll find applicants who have resumes with all of the skills suited for that moment.", "It’s all too tempting to tell yourself, “Well, we’ll find a first-principle thinker with the next hire.”", "Just look at what happened to Reed when he was at Pure Software. He’s a first-principle thinker. You’d think he’d hire other first principle thinkers.", "Game recognizes game, right? And yet he neglected that hiring standard for six years. That is why you must define your culture before you scale.", "And you have to think deeply about what cultural attributes you want to preserve at scale.", "Reed gave this a lot of thought in the founding days of Netflix. He wasn’t just looking backwards, at the lessons learned from Pure; he was also looking ahead, where he saw an enormous threat to the company.", "Forget Blockbuster, how would Netflix survive the dawn of online streaming? Broadband internet was making its way into households across the US.", "It seemed inevitable to Reed that streaming entertainment would eclipse DVDs, just as surely as the combustion engine eclipsed the horse and carriage.", "And here’s what makes Reed such a fantastic strategic thinker: He was fretting about this in the late ’90s, when broadband internet had reached fewer than 1 in 10 households.", "To comprehend why Reed hires first-principle thinkers at Netflix, you have to remember how he views these technological shifts.", "Innovations generally happen incrementally – except for those moments when everything dramatically changes.", "HASTINGS: If we continued to refine DVD-by-mail for another two decades, that would have been a failure strategy, because the underlying substrate was changing, and internet delivery was becoming possible.", "But now that we’re in internet delivery, we think that Internet television is going to be a 50 or 100-year paradigm.", "And so now our focus should shift to be, how do we do better and better on the core?", "HOFFMAN: Reed’s knowledge of history, the changing nature of technology, and the historical moment he was in, led to the understanding he would need people to change with the times.", "People who could rip up a process, and return to the first principles of delivering entertainment by any means necessary, whether it’s horseback, mail, fiber optic cable, or maybe in the future, Elon Musk’s neural lace.", "Regardless, you need people who can change the business model, fast.", "So how did Reed identify those candidates? It started with a now-legendary document at Netflix, a collection of more than 100 slides known as the “Culture Deck.”", "These slides defined exactly what the Netflix culture stands for, and who they’re trying to hire, and what they can expect.", "HASTINGS: The culture deck started about 10 years ago. So first couple of years, we were just focused on survival, then we got public in 2002, cash-flow positive", "and it was clear we were going to survive. So we then started really thinking about the culture: what we wanted to be, how we wanted to operate.", "And so over successive years, I improved this deck which I would go through with new employees. And sometimes those new employees would love it, sometimes they were like, “Oh my god, why didn’t you tell me this before I started?", "That doesn’t make sense to me.” And so we realized we should give it to every candidate.", "And so then about 2007, 2008, we did that by posting it on SlideShare. But again, it was really just to be able to send a link to the candidates.", "It’s not very pretty, it’s not very highly designed, doesn’t look like it’s an external marketing piece, but that authenticity, really, people liked in the outside world, and now it’s over 10 million views on SlideShare, and continues to be studied around the world.", "HOFFMAN: And what were the unexpected benefits of having published it?", "HASTINGS: Well the core benefit, which we did expect, was that candidates were very aware of the culture.", "The unexpected benefit was many people became candidates for us, because they loved that – what we described in terms of freedom and responsibility – that might not have otherwise thought about us.", "HOFFMAN: Here’s the fascinating thing about Netflix’s culture deck. It’s not meant to appeal to every job seeker.", "HOFFMAN: One of the things that I think that shocks people about the Netflix culture document is they say, “Look, adequate performance should get you a severance package.”", "What’s the way that you both create that high performance, but also doesn’t feel too dangerous to people?", "HASTINGS: We try to always emphasize honesty. So you can always ask your manager, “Hey, if I were leaving, how hard would you work to change my mind to stay?”", "That’s sort of the acid test, I would call it the “keeper test.” So we encourage people to check in with their manager on that.", "So we try to be very thoughtful, so it should be that there’s no surprises about that.", "And we all aspire to excellent performance, and there’s no short-term judgment, or like, “Last week you made a mistake, and so you’re out.”", "It’s not like that at all. It’s about, really, the expectation of future contribution, which is based on a range of factors and performance to date.", "HOFFMAN: This keeper test may sound a bit Darwinian. No one wants to hear a manager say, “I wouldn’t fight to keep you.", "Thanks for playing.” But I actually believe it’s more compassionate to ask this question, repeatedly.", "You have to be thoughtful about who fits in, and who clashes with their coworkers.", "Suppose a manager decides to keep a brilliant jerk on the team. Morale sags. The team’s performance drops.", "Then you have a truly Darwinian struggle on your hands. And in that sense, the keeper test cuts both ways.", "A manager can fail it as surely as any employee. That’s why a commitment to culture must pervade every decision.", "Without a clear sense of how staff should work together, it’s all too easy for managers to narrow their focus on individual players.", "And emphasizing individual performance, at the expense of the team, can be downright hazardous to an organization, as Margaret Heffernan has observed.", "HEFFERNAN: There is often a belief among very successful, very competitive people, that the thing you want to do in a company is get everybody to compete with each other.", "That if it’s “Everybody’s racing against everybody,” you’ll have this kind of white heat of brilliance and creativity.", "And I think pretty much everything about that’s wrong. And that’s not to say that I’m not competitive – I’m deeply competitive with myself, in the sense that I really want to do a better job today than I did yesterday.", "And I have seen more companies and organizations go wrong, because of what I think of as negative competitiveness: “I do want you to fail,” or, “I want your department to fail,” or, “I want your product to fail, because that will make me shine.”", "I’ve seen more damage and destruction and waste from that mentality than probably from any other misunderstanding.", "If you can build an environment in which people really want to help each other, full of people who are generous, you will do infinitely better than creating some kind of Olympic sport within the company.", "HOFFMAN: Here we come to the essence of a strong culture. It serves as a check on selfish ambition. It’s a civilizing force that excludes anyone who will drag down the team, and also welcomes anyone who elevates the team.", "In short, it’s warm but not cuddly. And if that sounds a bit paradoxical, Reed Hastings has a clarifying analogy.", "You’ll never hear him refer to his colleagues as a “family.” It’s a term that visibly grates at him. He likens Netflix instead to a sports team.", "They expect high performance from their players, and they use internal collaboration as a tool to drive external competitiveness.", "HASTINGS: In team sports that really succeed there often is a lot of warmth between the players. And so it’s emphasizing those aspects, and demonstrating that when people come in, everyone tries to help them.", "But ultimately, it is about performance, unlike a family, which is really about unconditional love. Even if your brother does something awful and goes to jail, your love doesn’t stop.", "And that’s just a different and important part of society, but that’s not what we’re about. What we’re about is collectively changing the world in the areas of internet television, and that takes incredible performance at every level.", "We’re also about really honest feedback all the time, so you can learn and be the best that you can be.", "HOFFMAN: So let it be known that Netflix does not promise unconditional love, and they’re exceptionally frank about this in their culture deck, which every prospective employee reads.", "This has become a powerful tool for them, one that creates a built-in filter to every hire. It’s a great hack that other companies would be smart to adopt.", "Because the hiring process is a critical – but often overlooked – part of maintaining company culture.", "When you’re growing and hiring fast, it’s easy to place expediency over excellence.", "You’ll often find yourself tempted to hire perfectly-qualified candidates, who you know, in your gut, are not a fit with your cultural values.", "So how do you resist the urge to hire a candidate who is brilliant, qualified, perfect in every way – with the sole exception that they might clash with the company’s culture?", "I asked Jeff Weiner, the CEO of LinkedIn, how he does it. “With reluctance,” he told me – until he saw the consequences of the decision.", "JEFF WEINER: I remember early on in my tenure at LinkedIn, we were around the table, call it a hiring committee, a small group of people responsible for evaluating new prospects.", "We were evaluating some LinkedIn profiles, and there was one profile in particular for a very important role, and the person who was sponsoring this prospect said, “Look at this profile, look at the background, look at this experience, look at the skill set.", "I mean, we couldn’t find anyone better. I should warn everyone, I don’t know that they’re the right kind of cultural fit for us, based on the following.", "And inevitably, when you try to pull that off, inevitably, it almost never does. And it becomes very expensive in terms of time, energy, and even resources working through that.", "Fast forward about six to nine months, and we were around the table, very similar group of people, evaluating somebody’s profile, and someone said, “Check out this profile, look at this background, look at this set of experiences and skills, just unbelievable.", "But they’re not a cultural fit, so let’s move on to the next candidate.”", "And that’s when you know you’re in a position where you can scale, especially when that discussion is taking place and you’re not in the room.", "HOFFMAN: Notice how Jeff points out that this willingness to reject A-players has to persist, even after he leaves the room.", "Some CEOs, like Aneel Bhusri, co-founder and CEO of Workday, refuse to leave the room until the team has made this decision so many times, it’s a reflex.", "ANEEL BHUSRI: In the early days, it’s just you and a few other people, so we just did it ourselves. We set out to interview the first 500 people.", "HOFFMAN: To be clear, by “we,” Aneel means he was personally involved in interviewing the first 500 hires for cultural fit.", "BHUSRI: And we would test on whether they were an “I” person or “we” person – we were looking for “we” people – we were looking for people that had a clear driver for why they wanted to be successful.", "We were looking for people that were high integrity. We were looking for people that did not job-hop.", "And you could look at a resume, you can tell if they’re the shiny, new-penny type that jumps from one op to another.", "We were looking at people that were going to be with us for seven, eight, nine, 10 years.", "We just did a town hall a couple days ago, and we’ve got tons of people who have been with us 10 years.", "And that’s how you build a great company. So I was interviewing those first 500 people.", "HOFFMAN: And it’s somewhat obvious from this, given that you set up that initial culture, but how then, past the first 500, did you help keep that?", "BHUSRI: Well, we kept interviewing people after the first 500, but we armed those first group of people.", "We decided, I think it was at a company meeting, to say, “OK, now you guys are on the hook. You interview the next 5,000.", "Make sure the next 5,000 people are great cultural fits.”", "HOFFMAN: I want to acknowledge the risk of this conversation. A strong culture is great for team performance, but you also run the risk of defining your culture so narrowly, that the founding team starts hiring in their own image.", "And if your founders are a bunch of young, Ivy League white guys hiring other young, Ivy League white guys, you’re not just being biased, you’re being foolish.", "You want a strong adaptive team? You need different perspectives.", "Tristan Walker, the founder and CEO of Walker & Co., considers the diversity of his staff a strategic advantage.", "They’re hard at work developing health and beauty products for people of color, which his competitors mistake for a niche market.", "It only looks niche when you’re surrounded by white people, he argues. His competitors’ oversight is his team’s opportunity.", "TRISTAN WALKER: So how do we come up with ideas and idea generation, et cetera? We have an innovation pipeline that’s three, four years long.", "But a lot of those ideas start with ourselves, because we’re part of the community we’re serving. This goes back to some of that strategic advantage.", "I feel like the diversity of our company needs to reflect the diversity of America, the diversity of the world.", "And out of that comes innovation and ideas that are fresh and new.", "HOFFMAN: It’s a sentiment echoed by Mariam Naficy, founder and CEO of Minted, a site that sells home decor from independent designers around the world.", "She invites designers to submit their best works through a crowdsourced competition. And she knows from experience that great design is tucked away in nearly every market of the world, just waiting to be discovered.", "MARIAM NAFICY: So my dad was with the UN. He is an economist – development economist – and so we would move every time he got a new assignment.", "So we were in Kuwait, then Lebanon, and we were there when the war started. Then Tanzania, which was stable, Iran – so I was there during the revolution – and then Egypt.", "And then, actually, I got exposed to a lot of design, architecture, and style that really influenced me.", "And my mom is Chinese, my dad is Iranian. We would haggle our way through markets a lot.", "HOFFMAN: And how did that diversity of international cultures and perspectives help prepare you for thinking about, “We’re going to do design competitions, we’re going to crowdsource design, we’re going to create a range?”", "NAFICY: You realize the breadth of perspective that is actually out there, that we don’t necessarily have access to as consumers here.", "That really helped me. I think also, I really believe different people have different aesthetic tastes, and you need to be able to address them.", "And the best way to address them is really by tapping into global creativity.", "HOFFMAN: I only bring up these examples because they underscore the hidden costs of a whitewashed office culture.", "You can scale a product to the world without looking like the world, to be sure, but the slightest misconceptions you have about your customers translate into missed opportunities for your business.", "And as an investor at Greylock, we look for a range of diversity on the team and on its board.", "We have worked with recruiting groups and all kinds of organizations, like Sheryl Sandberg’s Lean In movement, to close the gaps.", "But I don’t claim to have a silver bullet. At the very minimum, everyone should be playing the long game on this issue.", "When we ask this question year by year, it has to be front and center.", "Suppose you have your long game down. You have diversity, a culture deck like Netflix of 124 slides, clearly defined, built into the hiring process, shared with 10 million viewers.", "Are you all set to scale? Not quite. Because your culture is not just an expression of how your team works together, it’s how they work together at their best.", "You should tell the truth, but add a dash of idealism.", "HASTINGS: We try to constantly encourage employees to figure out how to improve the culture, not how to preserve it.", "And so everyone is trying to add value by, “Here’s a place we can improve in what we do.” And so that keeps it very alive.", "It’s not the golden tablets, it’s a constantly evolving living document and practice.", "HOFFMAN: I like Reed’s expression, “a living document”. And it’s brought to life by a peculiar tension between reality and aspiration: the culture you want and the culture you strive for.", "A truly strong culture is always under construction.", "HASTINGS: Yes, so it’s been updated a couple of times. We haven’t unwound anything, but we’ve constantly realized – the current issue is the deck makes us, in some cases, look cold and competitive, and actually employees experience us as very warm and collaborative.", "But that aspect doesn’t really come out in the decks. We’re constantly trying to update the deck to be more reflective of who we actually are.", "HOFFMAN: So Reed will keep revising that document, and his employees will keep reading it. And no matter what the size of your company, I’d suggest you do the same.", "Start early – when you’re still small and your culture is still being shaped – and recognize that it’s both a creative exercise and an organic system, one that your employees will shape with you.", "Granted, there are people who will tell you, this is a highly overrated exercise. Culture is an elusive concept.", "And some people question whether culture – right or wrong, strong or weak – is just a figment of our imaginations.", "HOFFMAN: I had a conversation with a friend of mine – who I can’t quote yet, because he hasn’t given me permission – but he basically argued to me that culture was a retroactive narrative of successful companies.", "When you’re successful, then you can tell the story of the culture that made you successful – and the classic one here is, “Culture eats strategy.”", "But do you think that that counter point of view is just foolish? Or do you think that that is something that actually, in fact, there is a little bit of, for really successful high-performing companies, are then very congratulatory to their culture?", "HASTINGS: Well, very successful companies also work in buildings rather than tents. But that’s a generally accepted practice, that buildings work better than tents.", "So you do have to watch out for that retroactive thing, of kind of what’s different.", "But I would say, on balance, the culture will help Netflix prosper through multiple eras in a way that, say, my first company Pure Software did not.", "So we’ve encountered many challenges, which Pure Software in the 1990s would not have been able to do.", "And so I’m very personally convinced that the culture has been helping on that.", "But again, I encourage people not to believe in things, that “Culture eats strategy for lunch.” Both are really important.", "We spend a lot of time on strategy, and why not do both well? Why do you have to rank them? Let’s try to do culture well, let’s try to do strategy well.", "HOFFMAN: Think about that list of changes Netflix has weathered. The same people who shipped DVDs are now producing original content, snapping up movies at film festivals, and streaming entertainment worldwide.", "Netflix is the Madonna of companies, constantly reinventing itself. And notice how Reed, despite his strategic brilliance, is convinced that his previous company wouldn’t have made the transition.", "It’s as close as you get to a control experiment – same strategic mind, two different cultures. Only one conquers the world.", "And maybe culture is just a byproduct of strategy. Maybe you can ignore it and focus on strategy alone.", "But consider that list of threats that Reed faced, do you really want to take that risk? I wouldn’t. At the very least, if you’re thoughtful about culture, you can avoid hiring a bunch of white guys named Reed.", "Otherwise, your water cooler banter will sound like this.", "HASTINGS: Great pleasure, Reid. Now let’s do the Reed and Reid thing.", "HOFFMAN: Oh, right. So Reed, it’s always great talking to you. I always learn something new.", "HOFFMAN: I’m Reid Hoffman – not Reed Hastings.

People who go to work there know what they’re signing up for, and that they’ll get a generous severance package (four months minimum) if they do get shown the door.", "They also know that having the company on their resume, even if only for a brief tenure, makes them more competitive in the larger job market.", "So while the Keeper Test does provoke anxiety, the majority of Netflix workers seem to find that it doesn’t dominate their experience at the company—perhaps because Netflix is adept at hiring people who are willing to put up with it.", "The second potential problem with the Keeper Test is that it could incentivize some very counterproductive behaviors—from excessive caution to constant in-fighting and undermining.", "Meyer writes in No Rules Rules that her initial reaction to hearing about the Keeper Test was that it would stifle psychological safety—the principle coined by Harvard Business School professor Amy Edmondson that “if you want to encourage innovation, you should develop an environment where people feel safe to dream, speak up, and take risks.”", "How safe can people feel if they’re always worried about getting on their boss’s bad side?", "But Netflix seems to have gotten around that problem by simultaneously encouraging blunt feedback and risk-taking.", "“At Netflix, it is tantamount to being disloyal to the company if you fail to speak up when you disagree with a colleague or have feedback that could be helpful,” Meyer writes.", "“After all, you could help the business-—but you are choosing not to.” Managers put requests for feedback on their agendas for one-on-one meetings with employees and are the recipients of “360” performance reviews that include constructive criticism from their own reports.", "As for risk-taking, Hastings writes that the mantra at Netflix is that “employees don’t need the boss’s approval to move forward (but they should let you know what’s going on).”", "By hiring smart people and then handing them lots of decision-making power, the company aims to cultivate an atmosphere where employees feel they are more likely to lose their jobs for turning in a safe, adequate performance than for taking a big risk that doesn’t pan out.", "What about backstabbing? “We are very careful not to have any firing quotas or ranking system,” Hastings says, noting that systems that encourage managers to compare employees against one another can discourage collaboration and lead to cutthroat, toxic environments.", "Meyer also says that she saw little evidence of Hunger Games competition afoot in her interviews with employees.", "But one former Netflix employee told the Wall Street Journal that when she was let go, her boss suggested that one thing she could have done differently was to fire someone on her own team sooner.", "(Netflix denies that the employee received this feedback.)", "Hastings suggests that the Keeper Test works because “everyone at Netflix is happier and more successful when there is a star in every position.”", "But is it desirable, or even possible, to have a team made up exclusively of stars?", "For one thing, it’s unclear what constitutes a star employee in Netflix terms. That means the Keeper Test may be vulnerable to misjudgment or bias on the part of managers.", "Research shows, for example, that we tend to have better evaluations of people who remind us of ourselves, and that favoritism often determines career advancement or lack thereof.", "Netflix says managers are expected to inform employees who are falling short, so that they’re not surprised if they get the ax.", "But some former employees say they didn’t receive feedback or opportunities to improve.", "Research suggests that star performance may be determined not just by a person’s innate talent, but by environmental factors, such as how much access a person has to organizational resources or the strength of their social network, as Ernest O’Boyle and co-author Sydney Kroska write in the Oxford Handbook of Talent Management.", "There’s also evidence, they write, that “stars’ output is attributable as much to their network and support structure as it is to any internal attributes.”", "But the Keeper Test, as explained in No Rules Rules, suggests that Netflix ascribes to the “great man theory,” wherein a person’s performance is both entirely under their control and a reflection of their efforts alone.", "No one would argue that it’s wise to hang onto underperformers. But a company that writes off people in the way Netflix does—Hastings endorses “firing a good employee when you think you can get a great one”—may not be devoting sufficient time to the question of how they might invest in good, hardworking employees to help make them great.", "Research shows that subpar performance can often be traced back to a manager who has created an unhealthy dynamic via low expectations or lack of confidence, as Jean-François Manzoni and Jean-Louis Barsoux explain in their book The Set-Up-to-Fail Syndrome.", "“Having made up his mind about a subordinate’s limited ability and poor motivation, a manager is likely to notice supporting evidence while selectively dismissing contrary evidence,” the pair write in Harvard Business Review.", "In No Rules Rules, Hastings downplays the potential pain caused by firings. For example, discussing his dismissal of former Netflix chief talent officer Patty McCord, who helped create the Keeper Test herself, he writes:", "“I started feeling that it would be best for us to have someone new in the role. I shared those thoughts with Patty, and we talked about what was leading me there.", "As it turned out she wanted to work less, so she left Netflix and it was very amicable.”", "McCord would agree that she and Hastings are still close, but her recounting of events is markedly different.", "“What I was surprised by was the profound sadness that I wouldn’t be part of it anymore,” she told Alex Blumberg on the podcast Without Fail.", "In McCord’s telling, the ouster wasn’t a completely mutual decision, nor does she describe it as a convenient way for her to work less.", "Indeed, Netflix often seems to try to skirt the question of the mental toll of getting fired, a position that McCord herself takes in a 2013 interview with NPR’s Steve Henn:", "HENN: How many people do you think you have fired?", "MCCORD: Oh, I would really like to remove that word from our vocabulary. It’s like, we don’t shoot people.", "HENN: OK. What word do you like? Severed is no less pleasant than fired.", "McCord’s preference for the phrase “move on” rather than “fire” may well be intended to reflect the fact that Netflix employees aren’t necessarily let go because of poor performance.", "At the same time, it suggests a certain refusal to consider the emotional toll of the Keeper Test too deeply.", "Ultimately, the Keeper Test is the result of a mindset that employees are disposable. In this sense, Netflix isn’t so different from a lot of other American companies.", "What’s new about the Keeper Test isn’t so much the end result (people getting fired, or worrying about the prospect of getting fired) but rather the company’s position that the test is a good thing, and even a selling point.", "In The End of Loyalty: The Rise and Fall of Good Jobs in America, author Rick Wartzman writes about how the post-World War II social contract that once existed between workers and their employers was gradually undone by the idea, brought to the fore by the economist Milton Friedman in the 1970s, that a business’s primary obligation was to its shareholders.", "Wartzman describes the shift as a move away from “this kind of ‘we’ mentality—we’re all in this together coming out of the Great Depression and the Great War—and moving more to an age of I, the individual,” as he told NPR.", "“The marketplace is sacrosanct, and it’s all about, you know, lifting ourselves up.”", "There are echoes of this in McCord’s framing of the culture she helped create: “Companies don’t exist to make you happy.", "You know that, right? The business doesn’t exist to serve you. The business exists to serve your customers,” she told Fast Company in 2016.", "But while companies don’t exist to make employees happy, the growing white-collar labor movement and the rise of conscious capitalism in the business world suggest that the relationship between companies and their workers may once again be on the brink of change.", "Even powerful CEOs like JPMorgan Chase’s Jamie Dimon and Walmart’s Doug McMillon are at least paying lip service to the idea that the purpose of companies isn’t just to serve customers or shareholders, but to take the interests of employees and communities into account, too.", "The Keeper Test is the logical product of a culture where job security is largely a relic of the past.", "Netflix’s high pay and severance packages doubtless mitigate some of the damage. But they don’t supply an answer to the moral argument that, given what we know about the impact that unemployment has on people’s mental health—and, in the US, on their access to health insurance and ability to find a new job—the bar for firing people should be high, not low."]}

First, here’s how Netflix says it will work:", "- The games will be bundled for free into Netflix’s main app, and for the time being, will be primarily meant to be played on mobile devices, though they may eventually migrate to TVs.", "- The company thinks some of its games will connect in some way to Netflix-owned franchises — you can definitely imagine a Stranger Things game, though probably not a Sex/Life one — but it may also license existing games and brands from other developers.", "- Netflix is describing its move into games as an initial foray — “We think the time is right to learn more about how our members value games,” the company said in its quarterly earnings release — but also says it expects to be in gaming for the long haul.", "“This is a core part of our subscription offering,” Greg Peters, the company’s chief operating officer, said during the company’s earnings call.", "- The company thinks the main value of its games will be in keeping existing subscribers more engaged in the Netflix app, and thus less likely to unsubscribe.", "The games could also, in theory, help drive new subscriptions.", "If you have paid attention to Netflix over the years, you have seen this move coming: Netflix executives, starting with CEO Reed Hastings, have mused for years about the fact that games are a major source of competition for Netflix users’ time and money.", "More concretely, the Information reported earlier this spring that the company was considering offering a bundle of games to subscribers, similar to the ones Apple offers via its Apple Arcade service.", "And last week, Bloomberg reported that Netflix had hired an executive to run its upcoming games service.", "On the other hand: If you’ve paid attention to Netflix over the years, you may also view this as a real departure from the company’s strategy — namely, from its insistence on focusing on doing one thing well.", "For years, Netflix executives have been asked when they will get into live sports or live news, or when they will add advertising to the service.", "The response is always the same: Netflix thinks a single-minded focus is the best way to win, and branching out beyond on-demand movies and TV shows would be a distraction.", "Now, the company says, it’s willing to try something new, while arguing that free games are a reasonable extension of what it’s already doing.", "The company’s subscription model means “we don’t have to think about ads [in games].

When Netflix tells the story about its first move into original content, it said that it thought its customers would like House of Cards because it knew its customers like other dark political soap operas.", "And while Netflix didn’t know anything about making shows when it started 10 years ago, it didn’t really have to know that: It simply paid David Fincher, Kevin Spacey, and production company Media Rights Capital to make the show — and then it streamed it to customers the same way it streamed the other shows and movies it already had.", "But figuring out how to make games is a very different skill set than making TV shows and movies — which is why most big entertainment companies have failed whenever they’ve tried to get into games themselves (big tech companies like Amazon, Apple, and Google have all swung and missed to varying degrees, as well).", "So it’s entirely possible that Netflix’s move into games could flop, too.", "On the other hand: As even the most hidebound Hollywood executive knows by now, games are bigger than Hollywood, and they’re not going away.", "If it’s going to take a long time to figure out, it’s better to get started sooner than later."]}

Potential for Bulyanhulu", "How Barrick transformed a derelict mine into a world-class asset", "Two years ago, the Bulyanhulu gold mine in Tanzania was on care and maintenance, with only its small tailings reprocessing operation still limping along: a burden to its shareholders and the state.", "Then Barrick took over, rebuilt and reopened Bulyanhulu, now transformed beyond recognition into one that, along with sister mine North Mara, has the potential to produce more than 500,000 ounces of gold per year14 and, according to the latest geological model, can maintain a consistent production profile to 2040 and beyond.", "“Bulyanhulu had effectively been trashed by its previous operators who also destroyed its relationship with its community as well as the government.", "But Barrick’s geologists saw the value in this unloved mine and we set about unlocking it, applying our core business principles,” said president and chief executive Mark Bristow.", "The first step was to mend bridges with the state, which resulted in the establishment of the groundbreaking Twiga Minerals Corporation, a joint venture between Barrick and the government of Tanzania, which oversees the management of the Tanzanian mines and the equal sharing of the economic benefits they create.", "The drill database was recompiled and validated, underground development was re-surveyed, new mineral resource and geotechnical block models were generated and mine designs were fully updated.", "The processing plant was completely refurbished and ramped up to a 145tph throughput, as were the vertical shaft and materials handling infrastructure.", "A secondary crushing and sampling circuit was introduced along with an open conical stockpile and reclamation facility designed to improve mill feed.", "During the past quarter, it commissioned a PhotonAssayTM laboratory, the first of its kind in Africa and in Barrick’s global operations.", "Bulyanhulu has also moved away from shipping concentrates abroad for processing and is now producing gold bars on site.", "In the meantime, ongoing geometallurgical testwork could unlock further resources within developed mine areas while brownfields exploration probes the potential within and outside the Bulyanhulu permit for new mining fronts.", "As the mine moves into the final stages of its ramp-up, the workforce has increased from 155 to 878, of whom 94% are Tanzanians, with 39% drawn directly from surrounding communities.", "Bulyanhulu is also increasing its economic support for local businesses, with 70% of its procurement now spent with Tanzanian contractors and suppliers.", "At the time of the Barrick-Randgold merger, Veladero in Argentina was identified as an asset that was seriously at risk.", "The operation was running out of leach stacking space and its relationship with the government and the surrounding community had deteriorated to the point where it no longer had a social licence to operate.", "The Covid-19 pandemic compounded its problems, with Argentina’s lockdown impacting on production as well on the progress of the mine’s two capital projects: construction of a new heap leach facility and the connection to the Chilean national power grid.", "Barrick president and chief executive Mark Bristow says the turnaround achieved by the new Latin America management team after the merger is extraordinary.", "Veladero is poised to come in at the top of its production guidance range for this year, the Phase 6 heap leach project has been commissioned successfully and stakeholder relations have improved to the extent that Barrick is now the preferred mining partner in the country’s San Juan province.", "Mine life has increased to more than 10 years on the back of successful resource conversions in the Cuatro Esquinas pushback and a new life of mine strategy designed to optimize the orebody.", "Exploration has resumed in the Veladero area and drilling at Lama — the Argentinian half of the border-straddling the Pascua-Lama project — has confirmed the existence of a large copper-gold porphyry system at depth.", "Bristow says over the past two years Barrick has invested $219 million14 in its goal of making Veladero another of its Tier One mines.", "Going forward, work has already started on a Phase 7 leach pad and on increasing efficiencies, among other things by re-establishing the conveyor system from the crusher to the leach pads to reduce haul distances and greenhouse (GHG) emissions.", "In October, construction was completed on the powerline from Chile, which is expected to reduce costs and GHG emissions, cutting diesel consumption by 23 million litres and CO2 equivalent emissions by 100,000 tonnes.", "To mark the completion of the Phase 6 project, Veladero established a community development fund, in partnership with San Juan, which will dedicate 1.5% of the mine’s gold sales to the improvement of the infrastructure in the province.", "Its commitment to the surrounding communities has also been demonstrated by the launch of a mining school and the use of local contractors for the Phase 6 and Phase 7 projects.", "“Our support for local suppliers and contractors provides the community not only with the opportunity to develop their skills but also to partner with the mine in creating shared value,” says Marcelo Alvarez, executive director Argentina and Chile.", "Veladero has also been successful in recruiting women in what has traditionally been a male-dominated industry.", "Fifteen of the 24 participants in its current technical training program are women and a further 17 are being trained as truck drivers.", "On another front, its staff have been leading the charge in the fight against Covid-19. Veladero is closing in on being fully vaccinated, with 99.7% having received their first dose and 74% the second.", "“It all starts with people,” says Mark Bristow. “And at this mine, 15,000 feet above sea level high in the Andes, a remarkable recovery in the face of adversity has been driven by its leadership and its workforce.”", "Mining Industry Needs Strong Collective Action on Climate Change", "Reducing emissions to counter the causes of climate change requires strong collective action by the mining industry, Barrick president and chief executive Mark Bristow says.", "Bristow hailed the collective commitment by the International Council on Mining and Metals (ICMM) to a goal of net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050 in line with the recommendations of the Paris Agreement and said it represented an integrated approach that struck the right balance between environmental, social and economic needs.", "Barrick is a member of the ICMM and its Climate Change Advisory Group.", "“Barrick already has a clear scientifically based emissions reduction roadmap which targets a 30% cut by 2030 against our 2018 baseline and a net zero outcome by 2050, in line with ICMM’s goal,” Bristow said.", "The company’s group sustainability executive, Grant Beringer, said a series of carbon-reducing initiatives was already being implemented across Barrick’s global operations.", "At NGM, the world’s largest gold producing complex, which is operated and majority-owned by Barrick, these included projects such as the construction of a new solar power plant and the conversion of the TS power plant from coal to natural gas.", "These projects will support NGM’s transition from coal power to a dual energy solution which will reduce the complex’s carbon emissions by as much as 50%.", "Barrick Commissions Africa’s First PhotonAssay Labratory", "Barrick, in partnership with MSALABS Ltd, has successfully installed a Chrysos PhotonAssayTM laboratory at its Bulyanhulu mine in Tanzania — the first in Africa and in its global operations.", "This new technique delivers faster, safer and more accurate analysis of gold, silver and complementary elements by non-destructive measurement of larger and more representative samples in as little as two minutes, enabling rapid turnaround of critical operational information that drives optimization throughout the mining value chain.", "The system provides an environmentally friendly, chemical-free, more sustainable replacement for traditional fire assay methods, significantly reducing CO2 emissions and hazardous waste.", "Introducing the new system to media at the mine, Barrick president and chief executive Mark Bristow said it was part of the group’s continuing drive to harness technological innovation in the service of operational excellence, occupational safety and environmental care.", "Loulo-Gounkoto’s New Underground Mine Ramps Up as Exploration Continues to Extend Complex’s Life", "The Loulo-Gounkoto gold complex is set to remain a major contributor to the Malian economy well into the future as it continues to replace the ore depleted by mining, says Barrick president and chief executive Mark Bristow.", "Mines operated in Mali by Barrick and its predecessor Randgold have spent some $8 billion14 in the country in the form of taxes, royalties, salaries and payments to local suppliers over the past 24 years.", "To date this year, it has paid $318 million14 to the government in taxes, royalties and dividends and invested more than $13 million14 in community wellbeing projects ranging from health and education to economic development initiatives such as its Business Accelerator program, designed to equip budding entrepreneurs with management skills.", "Bristow says Loulo-Gounkoto was on track to meet its annual production guidance, with its new underground mine at Gounkoto — the complex’s third underground operation — ramping up production.", "Through successful exploration it is on track to increase mineral reserves net of depletion for the third successive year and promising results from the Yalea Ridge and Gounkoto-Faraba targets reaffirm the potential for further life-of-mine extensions.", "“Loulo-Gounkoto is one of the world’s greatest gold mining operations and it continues to confirm its status as a member of the industry’s elite Tier One club as well as the largest private sector contributor to Mali’s GDP,” Bristow says.", "“In addition to the enormous value it creates for its stakeholders, Loulo-Gounkoto also aspires to a high level of social responsibility.", "Almost 40% of employees have been vaccinated against Covid-19 and 335 people have been vaccinated in the surrounding community.", "Security staff and other employees who come into contact with the community have undergone rigorous training in human rights.", "Work is also under way to secure the new certification standardized by the International Cyanide Management Institute.”", "Loulo-Gounkoto is maintaining its commitment to the employment and advancement of host country nationals, in line with Barrick’s global policy, and people from the nearby Kenieba village have been successfully trained to operate key equipment at the new Gounkoto underground mine.", "The complex is almost entirely staffed and managed by Malian citizens.", "Barrick’s Pueblo Viejo mine is continuing to advance a plant expansion and tailings storage facility project designed to extend its life to 2040 and beyond.", "President and chief executive Mark Bristow says that so far this year the Tier One mine has paid $522 million in direct and indirect taxes, which brings its total tax payments since it went into commercial production in 2013 to just under $3 billion.14 The extension of its life means that it would continue to be a major creator of value for the Dominican Republic and its people far into the future.", "“Of the mine’s 2,500 employees, 97% are Dominicans, many drawn from its surrounding communities which have all benefited substantially from its investment in upliftment programs.", "At present, the mine is involved in such programs in 58 surrounding communities. These include an agribusiness project intended to improve cacao cultivation in the area.", "In line with Barrick’s global policy of favoring local contractors and suppliers, Pueblo Viejo has also promoted the development of the local economy, spending more than $160 million with them over the past eight years14,” he says.", "Bristow says that Pueblo Viejo’s management had been very successful in addressing the environmental liabilities left by the mine’s former operator, significantly improving the water quality of the two nearby rivers.", "The drive for gender diversity was also paying dividends, with women now accounting for 16% of the workforce.", "“Our goal in the Dominican Republic, as elsewhere in the world, is to create long-term value for our stakeholders through our strategy of sustainable development.", "Pueblo Viejo’s expansion project has the potential to double the enormous contribution it has already made to the Dominican Republic’s economy.", "Without this project, however, that contribution could end soon,” he says.", "Industry Leader Kibali Continues to Advance Automated Mining", "The Kibali gold mine remains on track to achieve its production guidance for the year and grow its mineral reserves net of depletion, securing its future as a Tier One operation for at least another 10 years.", "Barrick president and CEO Mark Bristow says at the same time continuing investment in technological innovation is keeping Kibali at the forefront of developments in automated mining.", "Machine learning has been implemented at the mine’s three hydropower stations and reactive control of the enlarged battery installation will further reduce the need for back-up diesel generation, shrinking Kibali’s already relatively small carbon footprint.", "New automation software for the underground haulage loaders has been installed and the commissioning of a system for remote stope bogging now enables operators to control loaders from surface.", "“Surface control is safer and more efficient, and it also creates employment opportunities for women in an industry where these are not abundant.", "It’s worth noting that all these operators are Congolese, as Kibali continues to employ and upskill locals in line with Barrick’s global policy of giving preference to host country nationals.", "Congolese citizens currently make up 94% of Kibali’s workforce including its leadership,” Bristow says.", "“Five thousand of our employees and contractors go home to surrounding villages at the end of their shifts and the wellbeing of these communities is consequently a prime concern.", "This is exemplified by the effectiveness of Kibali’s anti-Covid-19 campaign which included the construction of a community treatment facility.", "With the support of the Congolese health authorities, we secured a supply of the AstraZeneca vaccine and to date 21% of employees and contractors have been vaccinated compared with the DRC’s countrywide average of 0.15%.”", "Bristow says the growth of Kibali had catalyzed and supported the emergence of a thriving local economy in a region previously largely reliant on subsistence farming.", "In the year to date, the mine has spent $95 million14 with local contractors and suppliers, many of whom were nurtured by the mine through skills transfer and capacity building.", "“To date Kibali has contributed $3.7 billion14 to the Congolese economy in the form of payments to contractors and suppliers, infrastructure community and support, salaries and royalties, taxes and permits.", "The success of our continuing exploration program around the mine confirms the potential for reserve growth from new open pittable resources and extensions to the high-grade underground orebodies, indicating that Kibali will materially benefit the DRC and its people for years to come.”", "Tanzanian Mines on Track for Production Guidance, Well-Placed to Extend Lives", "Barrick’s Tanzanian mines, North Mara and Bulyanhulu, are both set to meet their 2021 production targets as well as to replace depleted reserves through brownfields exploration.", "President and chief executive Mark Bristow says the production ramp-up at Bulyanhulu is gaining momentum with plant performance ahead of expectations and recoveries at a consistent rate of 93%.", "An 11% increase in tonnage was driven partly by an investment in three new fully automated loaders and three additional drills.", "Successful conversion and optimization of mineral resources in the upper portion of Deep West has been completed and is expected to add significant mineral reserves to the asset base, unlocking further value in the mine plan.", "In line with its long-term commitment to Tanzania, Barrick has also secured exploration

The high-grade underground orebody at Turquoise Ridge, then a Barrick property, was mined for years without a full understanding of its geology and was also constrained by the lack of its own processing plant.", "At the same time, Newmont’s neighboring Twin Creeks was facing the decline of production from its open pits and its processing facilities had never been pushed to deliver.", "The ramp-up of underground production at Turquoise Ridge, based on a completely new geological model, will pick up speed when its third shaft is completed next year, more than offsetting the drop in production from the now-integrated Twin Creeks.", "The integration of the two assets has also delivered new exploration opportunities in the gap between the two.", "During the past quarter, the Goldrush project’s official Notice of Intent was published, putting NGM well on the way to permitting its next major orebody.", "The updated feasibility study and the successful processing of the first ore samples has strengthened confidence that additional resources will be converted to reserves later this year.", "NGM continued to optimize its portfolio through the South Arturo/Lone Tree asset swap, which removed a closure liability from its balance sheet while securing additional ounces and geological upside by bringing the other 40% of South Arturo under its control.", "In the meantime, brownfields exploration is confirming a significant upside through prospects such as a major deposit in North Leeville and the promising Phoenix gold and copper satellite.", "Bristow said NGM was continuing to invest in infrastructure capable of supporting mining far into the future.", "This includes advancing data analysis capabilities and reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. An example of the latter is the second phase of the TS solar power facility which will increase its solar capacity to 200MW and is the cornerstone of NGM’s commitment to cutting GHG emissions by 20% by 2025.", "Reviewing the past quarter, Bristow said improved run times at all of NGM’s major processing facilities had lifted NGM’s performance while the restoration of the Carlin mill operations had set it up for a strong end to the year.", "Exploration Veteran Passes the Baton to Experienced Geologist and Team Leader", "Joel Holliday, senior vice president for Global Exploration, has been promoted to executive vice president for Exploration, effective November this year.", "He takes up the position of veteran Rob Krcmarov, who will assume a part-time non-executive role as Technical Adviser to Barrick.", "Prior to the merger, Joel managed Randgold’s exploration teams for 15 years with discoveries including Gounkoto and Loulo 3.", "Rob’s career spans 33 years, 13 of which he spent leading Barrick’s global exploration teams.

So, we see that over definitely through 2021.", "Only -- I'm only giving guidance through Q1 right now, and we are still working -- through some of the plans as we do this time of year.", "And then infrastructure will remain a healthy part of our investment as well. We're supporting aid of U.S. business that is growing at a rapid clip both in usage and in revenue.", "We're expanding regions globally and have a lot of upside in that area talking with customers on their transition plants to the cloud.", "So, we definitely do not want to run out of capacity, and we work to not do that. So there could be a risk of forwarding spend in 2021 due to uncertainty, but we'll see them, as we move through the year.", "Our next question comes from Doug Anmuth with JP Morgan. Please, proceed with your question. Doug, your line is open.", "Sorry. I muted. I apologize. Brian, I hope you could talk more about the importance of AMC Yellow Amazon logistics during the holiday season.", "If you could talk more about the percentage of packages, perhaps shipped from your fulfillment centers, and then where this can go in the coming years.", "And then also a quick comment on the COVID costs, you mentioned $2 billion in 1Q. Just curious how you think about it more on a full-year basis with some of the puts and takes that can be there.", "Yeah. So, yeah for the full year were again $11.5 billion was our gross cost for 2020, $4 billion of that in Q4.", "We see a step down to closer to $2 billion in Q1 that compares with a $600 million spent last Q1 as the pandemic just started and we start reacting in March and, obviously, this cost escalated in Q2 and Q3.", "So, if we look at the core components of that right you know there's productivity that a lot of productivity drags from hiring, so many new employees, and also having a physical separation.", "That gets better all the time. It was exasperated a bit in Q4 because of all the new hires that we brought on over 170,000 new people that should moderate.", "That's why one of the reasons that we were -- we see a step down in Q1 versus Q4 volume related and also mix of employees.", "After that we're going to see again, hopefully, the vaccine gets going.", "Everyone gets vaccinated and we return it to normalcy that would be very helpful on a lot of fronts for everybody.", "And if not, there'll be a continuation of some of these costs. I will say that while we are very transparent, I try to be on the costs that we're seeing specifically around COVID.", "There are some positive things happening that counteract a bit of that.", "That's the least of which is the top line volume. In 2020, we grew 37% and an FX-Neutral basis versus growing 22% in 2019.", "And the fact that we've been running pretty full out since arguably in April but definitely into May has created operating efficiencies of its own as a counterbalance to the physical separation and the training of new employees.", "We're able to save about a billion dollars in transportation costs this year, excuse me in 2020 as virtually all travel was shut down and our sales teams found new ways to reach customers.", "We'll see how that develops over time. Marketing although it got back to probably more healthy levels in Q3 and Q4, definitely was lower in Q2 as we work through some capacity issues and it wasn't fruitful to invest in marketing when you're having trouble hitting existing customer demand.", "So, there are a lot of moving parts that you know I'll try and be transparent on as I can be during the quarter.", "And this again, Q1 is, we're seeing about $2 billion of absolute dollar COVID costs. And then, David real quick.", "Yeah. And just as we talked about AMC or Amazon logistics right. That's we think about that in terms of the facilities.", "It's a lot of the middle mile in the last mile elements that are under our management control.", "And so you're talking about sort centers at the middle mile delivery stations with the last mile. We talked about it on square footage basis, 2020 was a big-build year for us.", "Our footprint grew around 50%, about half of that incremental square footage fit into that sort of AMCL transportation side of the equation which is the higher mix and what you've seen of any incremental add in a year.", "It's a higher mix being 50/50 than what you've seen from us in the past.", "So a lot of focus on that. They're both because of the desire to pre-pandemic increase the One-Day delivery capabilities for Prime members, but also you know as we've moved through this year, it gets us a little bit more -- much more certainty on being able to get items from point A to Point B.", "So, we finished the year where you know now more than half our packages both the U.S. and worldwide are handled through AMCL, and a lot of work going into that.", "And so, we'll -- we'll look to expand and continue to build on that with our AMCL offerings. But as we said in the past, our delivery partners, independent delivery partners that are out there that the USPS is certainly you know overseas carriers as well are an important part of that, and they'll continue to help us scale that up and build up that offering and make it better.", "Our next question comes from John Blackledge with Cowen. Please, proceed with your question.", "Great. Thank you. Two questions. First, the other revenue line saw a significant acceleration in force.", "Just curious if you can talk about or providing further color on the advertiser demand that you saw in the fourth quarter.", "And then second on grocery, it was a big driver for Amazon in 2020. Just general thoughts on the grocery.", "And I think you mentioned in the release of seven communities rolled out Amazon Fresh grocery stores.", "How are they performing and should we expect a broader rollout.", "Sure. John, let me start with the other revenue question. Yes, we saw strength in other revenue grew 64% in Q4 versus 49% in Q, and 41% in Q2.", "That is primarily advertising that's the majority of it.", "I would say that there's been a recovery in advertising spend as the year progressed. The fact that we moved Prime Day into Q4 has an impact here because again, it carried a lot of clicks and eyeballs into Q4 for that -- for this time period.", "But I want to highlight a lot of great work being done by the advertising team. Their main principle is to help sellers vendors authors publishers and partners.", "Use our tools navigate them as fluidly as possible, and add value both for them and for our cause, and customers get to see and find and discover new and different products.", "There are some things that are adding to the efficiency of advertising. We're now using a deep learning model to show more relevant sponsored products and had success with that.", "We're improving the relevancy of ads shown on the product detail pages all the time, and we've seen rapid adoption of video creative format for sponsor brands, all these things help check out the conversion and the productivity of the advertising both for the seller or vendor involved and also for Amazon it makes it a more productive experience for the customer as well.", "John, on the grocery point. Yeah, we've got a couple of different formats. I think there's you know the go-grocery has a couple of locations open and off to a good start.", "A lot of interest in those in the technology that those offer as well as the Amazon Fresh locations sort about eight locations open and I think in the neighborhood of about a half dozen locations are confirmed at open.", "So more to come on those. And there are others that are kind of tangent of footprints on that. You know the go-stores there's around 25 of those that are out there that also an important part of that is food.", "So you see, it's -- we've talked about this a bit in the past is we're doing.", "With online grocery and branching out from whole foods and so many other physical footprint locations, and being able to offer that convenience but we also think that you know being able to offer some innovative physical store grocery offerings like these go in fresh, some of which have some pretty cool self-checkout capabilities and implement some of that just walk out the technical qualities are really some interesting areas that are resonating with customers.", "I think that they appreciate that not just in times of maybe not when physical contact with everyone in the store but just even beyond that the general convenience of being able to move throughout the store and check out more efficiently than you otherwise would in a traditional retail environment.", "Our next question comes from Brian Nowak with Morgan Stanley. Please, proceed with your question.", "Thanks for taking my questions. I have two. The first one to be curious to hear about any of the learnings you had from the strength of the international business in 2020, and how you think about the right types of investments to make in that business in '21 and beyond to ensure you retain as many of these users and wallets as you've gained throughout 2020.", "And the second one, understanding the comments Brian earlier about the sort of investments going forward, maybe just talk to us a little bit about one day.", "Are these investments you're making, could they get you back to a one-day product in the later part this year or in '22 when the world normalizes, or are these assets you're putting in place now not able to be deployed from a one-day perspective when overall e-commerce slows down a little bit.", "Sure, Brian. Let me start with your international question. I think the biggest learning is that if we can move 2021 volume into 2020, it creates good leverage for us and that's kind of what we saw.", "There was essentially a doubling of the growth rate versus probably the going rate for 2020.", "Now again that was a very hard volume because of the COVID restrictions and issues with our workforce keeping our workforce safe and everything else.", "But I think what you saw was some very high leverage on that model that overcame, some of the more fixed costs that we're seeing and the Prime benefits.", "So you know pre invested as we've discussed in the past in things like video and devices and other elements of the Prime offering now grocery you'll see you're starting to see, and we've added those Prime benefits ahead of probably the curve that you would have seen in North America.", "So that is always created a bit of a drag on operating income.", "That as well as investments in new geographies the investment in India. The investment that we've made over the last two or three years that are in places like the Middle East, Turkey, Brazil, Australia most recently Sweden, and the Netherlands in 2020.", "So there's a lot of moving parts under the International segment, but you're starting to see the benefit of the higher volumes.", "And with its higher advertising as well that we expected and we expect over time and we'll see the growth rate is gonna have the same challenges year over year that perhaps we'll see in North America.", "We're going to have a race between lapping things that may have been onetime in nature in 2020 versus accelerating Prime membership and Prime members purchases, purchase frequency, and adoption of digital benefits.", "So we'll see what that looks like in 2021. Very happy with the performance in 2020, and really, hats off to the teams in many countries around the world who are all dealing with the same issues that we were in North America.", "Another is a bit of an offshore but I just think you know it's worth mentioning it fits in the AWS business", "but you know we're continuing to see strong growth made AWS around the world as well and there's a number of international located customers out there like Mako Libre, Solando and others that we've lost in there that our great customers for us.", "So we're working on that and really looking to support that just globally. And I mentioned this before, but you know reInvent was a great way to bring a lot of those folks from around the world together virtually and free.", "And typically, we've recorded the revenue for reInvents from ticket sales and sponsorships.", "If your account for this COVID and not only this year of being virtual and free, AWS year-over-year revenue growth you'll get it actually accelerated adjusting for that from the third quarter to the fourth quarter.", "So a lot of fun innovation good innovation coming out of that event that we're excited to talk, talk more with customers about.", "And your question on One Day, I believe it was you know our investments will be consistent with establishing higher and higher levels of One Day.", "Yes, definitely. And we've been doing that throughout the year and it's been getting better. In fact, we had a lot of examples of deliveries right up to the last minute on December 24, in the United States for holiday gifts.", "So the One Day has been getting better, and it's the issue in 2020 was essentially around capacity and volume and getting things out the door and being able to then hit a shorten time period.", "So it wasn't that we were delaying or slowing down the shipment itself, it was the time taken to get through the warehouse and handle the backlog of demand.", "So as the year progressed, we did see that get better and better. We do forecast that it will get better.", "They are not quantifying this, right. I realize that, but I think you can generally notice wherever you particularly are wherever geography is some cities are back you know probably to One Day levels that they saw are even better pre-pandemic.", "Other areas that may have other dynamic issues are still working their way out of backlog and volume issues.", "But you know when they -- the dust settles and as we open up more and more capacity, you'll see greater and greater One-Day percentages for our Prime shipments.", "Our next question comes from Justin Post with Bank of America. Please, proceed with your question.", "Justin Post -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst", "Right. Thank you. A couple. First, obviously that Jeff Bezos's announcement is quite important.", "I think Jeff Wilke is also retiring. Can you talk a little bit about if you expect any changes to Amazon, how we should think about that?", "And then maybe Dave Clark is taking over retail. Talk a little bit about that. And then secondly, obviously the backlog is really strong AWS is up 68% the margins did come down a little bit quarter over quarter to 28%.", "Can you talk about the deals how pricing is in the Cloud segment? Is it remaining robust? And for any reason, the margins came down a little bit quarter over quarter.", "Sure, Jeff. Let me start with your comments on the CEO transition and then the consumer CEO transition.", "I think they are both examples of what are highly effective succession planning processes at Amazon. The board of directors obviously takes that very seriously.", "It is an annual discussion and is more often on succession plans development of key executives expanding the number of key executives, etc.", "And you see the byproduct of that as we expand the team as we -- five years ago set up the two CEO structure where Jeff Bezos while he was CEO of consumer, and Andy Jassy was CEO of AWS.", "We have strong single-threaded leaders on devices, Amazon Video, including Amazon Studios advertising.", "Yes, so I think there's a lot of bench strength within Amazon.", "And generally, we do try and push through the decisions down in the organization as we scale especially internationally as we try and do things consistent globally but recognize local differences in our model.", "So having said all that, succession planning is super important. The example you saw with Jeff Wilke.", "Jeff announced in the fall that he was stepping down to pursue some other goals and interests that he has outside of Amazon.", "He had been here for over 20 years had you know and been super pivotal in the development of our consumer business, our culture, and the development of layers and layers of leaders.", "And one of them was Dave Clark who has over the last five-plus years really been charged with developing some very fundamental things for our company.", "The expansion of the film center network, the expansion and creation of our transportation capacity, grocery delivery, and Go grocery plan, and a lot of other things, but you know Dave has you know had been a great leader in his own right.", "So when Dave or when Jeff Wilke decided to retire in the fall it was a natural transition to Dave Clark, and that just occurred in January and they're wrapping things up in the next month.", "So that's a successful example of succession planning and a successful transition. It's the same thing for Jeff Bezos as well.", "And I will reiterate that Jeff is not leaving, he is getting a new job. He's going to be executive chair of the board.", "Super important role. The board is super active and important in Amazon's success story. And you know Andy has been here since 1997.", "He is not only a visionary leader, but he's also a strong operator as I said, and he's got a great track record of developing multiple things and businesses within Amazon.", "Not the least of which is AWS which is arguably the most profitable important technical technology company in the world.", "So that's just a flavor on the insight on how it works. We're very happy to see both Jeff and Andy get a new perspective.", "He is certainly going to carry through culture and the vision and the invention factory that Amazon is, and we'll take that to the next level.", "Jeff will be the executive chair on the board. He will be involved in many large one-way door issues, which as we say one-way doors meaning the more important decisions things like acquisitions things like strategies, and going into grocery and other things.", "So Jeff's always been involved with that, and that's where you know we'll keep his time focused on, he'll keep his time focused on his new role.", "So very excited. they are all around to see the ability to have a strong transition to Andy in Q3. You know we'll be working on backfilling the AWS role, and we'll talk more about that in the future.", "And Justin about the AWS point. I mean, like I've mentioned before it's obvious growth rates strong. The factors we've talked about in the past continue to be in play and we're improving infrastructure planning to meet the capacity needs given the growth.", "We're seeing more broadly our results reflect that balance between the investing the price reductions, driving cost efficiencies and the margins are going to fluctuate quarter to quarter depending on those factors to the extent we are investing in the regions and some other elements.", "A few discrete things that aren't you know probably knew. But just to call out the driver of the produced impact from the change in the useful life of the servers you will call we amended the server useful life at the beginning of the year from three to four years., and so we saw some benefit to the AWS margins and the broader margins in total.", "When we look at that, the impact does diminish throughout this year. So, when we increased it beginning in January to benefit from this change in Q4 was about $538 million, which's down from $634 million in Q3, so that gives you some sense of it's it's coming down.", "That's the total amount it's allocated among the segments but the majority of those figures I just gave do relate to AWS because the significance of the server assets going in that segment and that impacts can continue to taper down over time.", "For example, into Q1 of 2021. One other element is just fx impact that's always going to get us to some degree but AWS customer billings are probably primarily denominated in U.S. dollars.", "The cost, so if you think about it many of the costs are going to be for buildout in local currency for data centers and the people that work there and power and what have you.", "So there's a bit of a foreign exchange difference there and that happens to be this time around a little bit bigger.", "We saw an unfavorable impact of about $96 million to the database margin this time around for fx. So just another point too to call out there.", "You mentioned the backlog to it. Yeah, look I think that's one data point. You know among many as you look at AWS, but I think we're really encouraged by just general large enterprise business adoptions continuing to do well as they're choosing AWS provider and speeding up innovations.", "You saw a long list of the many companies that we've announced arrangements with in the past 90-days, so really excited to continue to build on that.", "Our final question comes from Ross Sandler with Barclays. Please, proceed with your question.", "Hey guys, yeah just going back to the topic of shipping cost inflation, this is one of the few lines that's kind of variable and kind of increasing a little bit faster than the other fixed costs.", "Indeed, he mentioned that over half the orders are now going through Amazon logistics worldwide. When do you expect that rate of inflation per order to level out a little bit because of these efforts?", "And if you look at the cost curve in places like the U.K. where in London where you have you know well over half on your own last-mile delivery.", "Are you starting to see leverage there? Any comments on that. Thanks a lot.", "Yeah on that. This is Dave. I think it's not -- I won't give a forward kind of guidance next or what that level as well as off like some of the step-up in costs in disparity or the bigger gap I should say versus the unit growth rates that you're seeing there.", "This is Q4, we did add on a lot of new capacity. As I said, it came on later in the year into Q4 more of it was in kind of transportation arm, and so the cost associated with that would be going in that trans cost piece.", "So that's one of the factors as you know along with the fact that you know we're continuing to try where we can to focus on improving One Day.", "I mean that varies from region to region with all that kind of challenges of COVID that have gone on this year, but that's a goal of ours is to get back to where we were in terms of the One Day unit mix and continue to build on to that.", "So that'll be something to keep an eye on as we move into 2021. Thanks for joining us on the call today and for your questions.", "The replay will be available on our Investor Relations website for at least three months. We appreciate your interest in Amazon, and we look forward to talking with you again next quarter.", "Justin Post -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst"]}
