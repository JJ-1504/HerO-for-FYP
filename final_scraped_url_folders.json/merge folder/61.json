Significantly, Facebook also continued to grow its MAU base, reporting 2.8 billion monthly active users for the quarter, also ahead of consensus estimates.", "These strong results could position Facebook well as the company expects to face ad targeting headwinds due to platform changes and shifting regulations in 2021.", "(Below is Investopedia's original earnings preview, published January 26th, 2021.)", "Despite major headwinds, Facebook Inc.

That's because Facebook already has deeply saturated most global consumer markets and has an estimated 2.7 billion MAU.", "As a result, fast growth is becoming more difficult to achieve off of such a large base.", "Facebook's MAU has grown every quarter for at least three years. Overall, though, there has been a gradual slowing down in the rate of MAU growth over this period.", "YOY MAU growth in Q4 periods has slowed from 14.5% in Q4 FY 2017 to 9.0% in Q4 FY 2018 to 7.6% in Q4 FY 2019.", "For Q4 FY 2020, analysts predict a slight uptick in MAU growth to 9.1%.

the company's performance.", "The primary purpose of using non-GAAP measures is to provide supplemental information that may prove useful to investors and to enable investors to evaluate the company's results in the same way management does.", "Management believes that supplementing GAAP disclosure with non-GAAP disclosure provides investors with a more complete view of the company's operational performance and allows for meaningful period-to-period comparisons and analysis of trends in the company's business.", "Further, to the extent that other companies use similar methods in calculating non-GAAP measures, the provision of supplemental non-GAAP information can allow for a comparison of the company's relative performance against other companies that also report non-GAAP operating results.", "Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share excludes, to the extent applicable, the impact of the following items: stock-based compensation, amortization of acquisition-related intangibles, and previously the net amortization of debt discount on the company's convertible senior notes, as well as income tax adjustments.", "These items are excluded because the decisions that give rise to them are not made to increase revenue in a particular period, but instead for the company's long-term benefit over multiple periods.", "Specifically, management is excluding the following items from its non-GAAP earnings per share, as applicable, for the periods presented in the Q4 FY20 financial statements and for its non-GAAP estimates for Q1 and FY21:", "- Stock-Based Expenses: The company's compensation strategy includes the use of stock-based compensation to attract and retain employees and executives.", "It is principally aimed at aligning their interests with those of our stockholders and at long-term employee retention, rather than to motivate or reward operational performance for any particular period.", "Thus, stock-based compensation expense varies for reasons that are generally unrelated to operational decisions and performance in any particular period.", "- Amortization of Purchased Intangibles: The company views amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets, such as the amortization of the cost associated with an acquired company's research and development efforts, trade names, customer lists and customer relationships, and in some cases, acquired lease intangibles, as items arising from pre-acquisition activities determined at the time of an acquisition.", "While these intangible assets are continually evaluated for impairment, amortization of the cost of purchased intangibles is a static expense, which is not typically affected by operations during any particular period.", "Although we exclude the amortization of purchased intangibles from these non-GAAP measures, management believes that it is important for investors to understand that such intangible assets were recorded as part of purchase accounting and contribute to revenue generation.", "- Gains on Strategic Investments, net: Upon the adoption of Accounting Standards Update 2016-01 on February 1, 2018, the company is required to record all fair value adjustments to its equity securities held within the strategic investment portfolio through the statement of operations.", "As it is not possible to forecast future gains and losses, the company assumes no change to the value of its strategic investment portfolio in its GAAP and non-GAAP estimates for future periods.", "- Income Tax Effects and Adjustments: The company utilizes a fixed long-term projected non-GAAP tax rate in order to provide better consistency across the interim reporting periods by eliminating the effects of items such as changes in the tax valuation allowance and tax effects of acquisition-related costs, since each of these can vary in size and frequency.", "When projecting this long-term rate, the company evaluated a three-year financial projection that excludes the direct impact of the following non-cash items: stock-based expenses and the amortization of purchased intangibles.", "The projected rate also assumes no new acquisitions in the three-year period, and considers other factors including the company's expected tax structure, its tax positions in various jurisdictions and key legislation in major jurisdictions where the company operates.", "For fiscal 2020, the company used a projected non-GAAP tax rate of 22.5%. For fiscal 2021, the company uses a projected non-GAAP tax rate of 22.0%, which reflects currently available information, as well as other factors and assumptions.", "The non-GAAP tax rate could be subject to change for a variety of reasons, including the rapidly evolving global tax environment, significant changes in the company's geographic earnings mix due to acquisition activity, or other changes to the company's strategy or business operations.", "The company will re-evaluate its long-term rate as the rate as appropriate.", "The company defines the non-GAAP measure free cash flow as GAAP net cash provided by operating activities, less capital expenditures.", "For this purpose, capital expenditures does not include our strategic investments.", "View original content to download multimedia:http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/salesforce-announces-record-fourth-quarter-and-full-year-fiscal-2020-results-301011143.html"]}

Among other things, the 2012 order prohibited Facebook from making misrepresentations about the privacy or security of consumers’ personal information, and the extent to which it shares personal information, such as names and dates of birth, with third parties.", "It also required Facebook to maintain a reasonable privacy program that safeguards the privacy and confidentiality of user information.", "The FTC alleges that Facebook violated the 2012 order by deceiving its users when the company shared the data of users’ Facebook friends with third-party app developers, even when those friends had set more restrictive privacy settings.", "In May 2012, Facebook added a disclosure to its central “Privacy Settings” page that information shared with a user’s Facebook friends could also be shared with the apps used by those friends.", "The FTC alleges that four months after the 2012 order was finalized in August 2012, Facebook removed this disclosure from the central “Privacy Settings” page, even though it was still sharing data from an app user’s Facebook friends with third-party developers.", "Additionally, Facebook launched various services such as “Privacy Shortcuts” in late 2012 and “Privacy Checkup” in 2014 that claimed to help users better manage their privacy settings.", "These services, however, allegedly failed to disclose that even when users chose the most restrictive sharing settings, Facebook could still share user information with the apps of the user’s Facebook friends—unless they also went to the “Apps Settings Page” and opted out of such sharing.", "The FTC alleges the company did not disclose anywhere on the Privacy Settings page or the “About” section of the profile page that Facebook could still share information with third-party developers on the Facebook platform about an app users Facebook friends.", "Facebook announced in April 2014 that it would stop allowing third-party developers to collect data about the friends of app users (“affected friend data”).", "Despite this promise, the company separately told developers that they could collect this data until April 2015 if they already had an existing app on the platform.", "The FTC alleges that Facebook waited until at least June 2018 to stop sharing user information with third-party apps used by their Facebook friends.", "In addition, the complaint alleges that Facebook improperly policed app developers on its platform. The FTC alleges that, as a general practice, Facebook did not screen the developers or their apps before granting them access to vast amounts of user data.", "Instead, Facebook allegedly only required developers to agree to Facebook’s policies and terms when they registered their app with the Facebook Platform.", "The company claimed to rely on administering consequences for policy violations that subsequently came to its attention after developers had already received data about Facebook users.", "The complaint alleges, however, that Facebook did not enforce such policies consistently and often based enforcement of its policies on whether Facebook benefited financially from its arrangements with the developer, and that this practice violated the 2012 order’s requirement to maintain a reasonable privacy program.", "The FTC also alleges that Facebook misrepresented users’ ability to control the use of facial recognition technology with their accounts.", "According to the complaint, Facebook’s data policy, updated in April 2018, was deceptive to tens of millions of users who have Facebook’s facial recognition setting called “Tag Suggestions” because that setting was turned on by default, and the updated data policy suggested that users would need to opt-in to having facial recognition enabled for their accounts.", "In addition to these violations of its 2012 order, the FTC alleges that Facebook violated the FTC Act’s prohibition against deceptive practices when it told users it would collect their phone numbers to enable a security feature, but did not disclose that it also used those numbers for advertising purposes.", "The Commission vote to refer the complaint and stipulated final order to the Department of Justice for filing was 3-2.", "The Department will file the complaint and stipulated final order in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia.", "Chairman Simons along with Commissioners Noah Joshua Phillips and Christine S.

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Facebook First Quarter 2020 Earnings Conference Call.", "Ms. Deborah Crawford, Facebook's Vice President of Investor Relations, you may begin.", "Deborah Crawford -- Vice President, Investor Relations", "Thank you. Good afternoon and welcome to Facebook's first quarter 2020 earnings conference call. Joining me today to discuss our results are Mark Zuckerberg, CEO; Sheryl Sandberg, COO; and Dave Wehner, CFO.", "Before we get started, I would like to take this opportunity to remind you that our remarks today will include forward-looking statements.", "Actual results may differ materially from those contemplated by these forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause these results to differ materially are set forth in today's press release and in our annual report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC.", "Any forward-looking statements that we make on this call are based on assumptions as of today and we undertake no obligation to update these statements as a result of new information or future events.", "During this call, we may present both GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP measures is included in today's earnings press release.", "The press release and an accompanying investor presentation are available on our website at investor.fb.com.", "Finally, we hope that everyone listening today is staying safe. The vast majority of us at Facebook our working productively from home and everyone on this call this afternoon has dialed in remotely.", "Mark Zuckerberg -- Founder, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "All right. Thanks everyone for joining us today. Before we get started, I also just want to say that I know this is a very hard time for a lot of people.", "I know a lot of you are calling in from New York, where this has been particularly tough, although, almost everyone has been affected by what's going on in some way.", "So just want to start by acknowledging that and taking a moment to thank everyone working on the front lines to help all of us get through this.", "There is a lot of uncertainty now about the world and what it will look like over the coming months. And Sheryl and Dave are going to give some more context on what that means for our business.", "The impacts on our business has been significant and I remain very concerned that this health emergency and therefore the economic fallout will last longer than people are currently anticipating.", "And while there are massive societal costs from the current shelter-in-place restrictions, I worry the reopening in certain places to quickly before infection rates have been reduced to very minimal levels, will almost guarantee future outbreaks and worse, longer-term health and economic outcomes.", "So with that said, I want to use this time today to discuss how we're responding to COVID, what we're seeing across our services and some reflections on how we plan to run the company going forward.", "So responses has been focused on three areas. Helping people stay connected while we're all apart; assisting the public health response and working on the economic recovery, especially for small businesses.", "And I'll start with how we are assisting the public health response. The first step here is connecting people with authoritative health information.", "And we built a COVID-19 information center with authoritative information from health officials and governments and messages encouraging people to stay home that are coming from public figures they trust.", "And we put this COVID-19 Information Center at the top of everyone's Facebook app, and so far we've directed more than 2 billion people to it.", "Equally important is also limiting the spread of misinformation. We don't allow content that puts people at imminent risk of physical harm.", "So when people share hoaxes like that inhaling water, curious COVID, which is both false and will be physically harmful if anyone does that, we take that down.", "For other types of misinformation, we partner with independent fact checkers who have marked more than 4,000 pieces of content related to COVID as false, which has resulted in more than 40 million warning labels being seen across our services, and we know that these work because 95% of the time when someone sees a warning label, they don't click through to view that content.", "Now beyond helping people broadly access high quality informationm, we're also focused on helping governments and health authorities get better data in a privacy protective way to inform key policy decisions that they need to make as well.", "So we partnered with Carnegie Mellon to run a widespread symptom survey on Facebook, and we're using their findings to produce daily county-by-county maps of the symptoms that people are experiencing across the country, and soon globally as well.", "And since people experiencing symptoms is a precursor to them going to the hospital or getting more seriously ill, this tool can help local governments and health officials plan how to allocate scarce resources like PPE and ventilators as well as determine when it's safe to start reopening an area or when an area will need to have tighter shelter orders if symptoms reemerge.", "And just this morning we announced that we were working to connect these symptom surveys to ground truth infection rate data from large serology in PCR studies that are funded separately by the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative in order to more accurately determine the true infection and exposure levels globally on a local-region basis as well.", "So this is work that we're uniquely positioned to do, because Facebook is a global community and people use their authentic identities on our service.", "So that means that we can make sure that the data is meaningful. But we're very focused on doing this in ways that we know are going to be helpful to the health response and that protect people's privacy and human rights, which is why we've primarily focused on how aggregate data can help.", "Now outside of Facebook, Priscilla and my work at the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative with alongside leading experts in science and health continues to inform my views on the best ways for us to assist in this health response.", "And also what we should expect going forward with this disease.", "All right so, next I want to discuss how we're helping people stay connected with the people they care about, even while we can't be together during this period.", "So this is our core mission. And I'm proud of how we've supported people around the world during this time.", "We know that people especially rely on social apps in times of crisis and in times when we can't be together in person.", "And right now we are experiencing both of those all around the world at the same time. So we're seeing major increases and use of our services.", "For the first time ever, there are now more than 3 billion people actively using Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp or Messenger each month.", "That includes 2.6 billion people using Facebook alone and more than 2.3 billion people using at least one of our services every day.", "In many of the places that have been hardest hit by the virus, messaging volume has increased more than 50% and voice and video calling has more than doubled across Messenger and WhatsApp.", "In Italy, for example, we've seen up to 70% more time spent across our apps. Instagram and Facebook Live views doubled in one week.", "And we've also seen time and Group video calling increase by more than a 1000% over March. Making sure that our services are stable and reliable during this period is a top priority.", "We're monitoring usage closely and adding capacity in our data centers where we can. The investments we've made in shared infrastructure that cover all of our different services over the years, has helped us manage through this, but it has been a challenge while all our teams have been working remotely.", "And I'm showing these numbers to give you a sense of the surge in people relying on these services that we're seeing.", "Obviously, I wish the circumstances were different. And I don't expect that this exact spike in usage will sustain over a longer period of time.", "But in some areas, I think we are seeing an acceleration in pre-existing long-term trends like the dramatic increase in online private social communication that is likely to continue.", "And if nothing else, this usage shows that for a lot of people around the world, these services are part of the social infrastructure that brings us together.", "Now even before COVID-19, our product strategy is already focused on building out private social platforms and enabling online commerce.", "So it's well aligned with what people need now. Last week, we announced a number of new product improvements on video presence, which has emerged as in especially critical part of the private social platform during this time.", "Our view is that video presence includes three categories. Video calling, Video rooms and live video.", "And we plan to lead and offer the best services for social uses in each of those different categories.", "Video calling, is when you actually ring a person's phone or computer and it's by far the most used type of video chat.", "Between WhatsApp and Messenger, there are more than 700 million daily actives participating in calls.", "We are doubling the size of WhatsApp video calls from four to eight. This is important because WhatsApp is the most popular end-to-end encrypted calling service.", "So if you care about privacy and encryption and you want to be able to reach anyone, you're probably using WhatsApp.", "And now you can get your whole family or a larger group together on calls.", "For video rooms we announced a completely new product called Messenger Rooms. And the idea here is that you can create a room for any active event you want, send the link to your friends or have them discover your room on Facebook", "and then they can just drop in and hang out for a bit. And this is different from any other video presence experience because it is serendipitous.", "You don't have to plan on an event and schedule in advance if you don't want. But it could be much more spontaneous and fun and I've really enjoyed getting to use this as we've been building out Messenger Rooms internally, and I'm looking forward to getting it in more people's hands around the world soon.", "Live video is also particularly important right now. People used to primarily live stream physical events, but it's almost known as planning physical events right now livestreaming has become the primary venue for many events, whether that's the Pope's weekly mass on Facebook Live or DJs hosting dance parties on Instagram, every day more than 800 million daily actives are engaging with live streams, across workout classes, concerts and more.", "We pivoted the Facebook events team to help people create online events including enabling people and small businesses to charge people who have joined their events in order to support small businesses that rely on in-person services before.", "The last area of our response that I want to discuss is how we're helping with the economic recovery, especially for small businesses.", "Sheryl, will talk about this more, but with so many businesses forced to close their physical storefronts, more are looking to build their digital presences and those which already invested in their digital presences are increasingly viewing them as the primary storefronts.", "So we're working on a number of ways to deepen this experience, helping people buy items and services directly within our apps.", "I mean we're going to a lot more to share on this soon.", "Overall, though, our business, depends on the success of small businesses. So this is a moment where we feel that we're well positioned to be champions for small businesses interests and supporters of important infrastructure that they're going to need in order to move online.", "One aspect of online commerce that I want to mention is the partnership that we just announced with Jio platforms in India.", "The largest Facebook and WhatsApp communities in the world are in India, and we think that there is an especially important opportunity to serve small businesses and enable commerce there over the long-term.", "By bringing together JioMart, which is Jio's small business initiative to connect millions of shops across India with WhatsApp, we think that we're going to able to create a much better shopping and commerce experience.", "And there's a lot more that we can do here, and I'm looking forward to making progress with the team at Jio.", "Now beyond our immediate plans to help respond to the pandemic. I also want to share some reflections on how we're planning to run the company during this period.", "I have always believed that in times of economic downturn, the right thing to do is to keep investing in building the future, and I believe this for a few reasons.", "First, when the world changes quickly, people have new needs and that means that there are more new segments to build.", "Second, since many big companies will pull back on their investments, there are a lot of things that wouldn't otherwise get built, but that we can help deliver.", "And the third, I believe that there is a sense of responsibility and duty to invest in the economic recovery and to provide stability for your community and stakeholders if you have the ability to do so.", "And we're in a fortunate position to be able to do this. Along with our strong financial position and the important social value our services provide, we're planning to hire at least 10,000 more people in product and engineering roles this year, so we can continue building and making progress.", "Now that said, with advertiser spending less than our business performance below expectations, we do plan to moderate some areas of our expense growth especially in business functions.", "We accepted our profit margins will decrease this year as we continue investing. And Dave will share more on our financial outlook in a few minutes.", "But this economic pullback has certainly reinforced for me the importance of maintaining high margins.", "Our financial position has allowed us to continue investing in building products and making investments like our partnership with Jio, even when the underlying economic conditions are challenging.", "As always, I am grateful to everyone on this journey with us and that's especially true during this period.", "As our services play in an especially important role right now, in helping people stay connected and assisting the public health response and working on the economic recovery, I really want to thank all of our employees who are working hard to deliver these services and everyone who has believed in us and supported our company over the years to help us get to the point where we can deliver these services for people around the world.", "So, thank you. And with that, here is, Sheryl to talk more about our business.", "Thanks, Mark, and hi everyone. As Mark said, this is an extraordinarily challenging time. It's a public health emergency, a global economic crisis and a time of great anxiety and personal tragedy for so many.", "My heart goes out to everyone on this call who has lost someone they love, and to everyone for the many ways so many are suffering.", "Mark talked about how our company has responded during this emergency to keep people safe and informed.", "How we see our responsibilities and how we are thinking about the future. I'm going to talk more about the impact we have seen in our business and what we are doing to help other businesses survive and recover in this changing landscape.", "Our total ad revenue for Q1 was $17.4 billion, which is a 17% year-over-year increase. After a strong start to the quarter, we saw a significant impact on our business as a consequence of the pandemic from the second week of March onwards.", "This impact has not been felt evenly. We've seen strong growth in gaming and relative stability in technology and e-commerce, which is one of our largest sectors.", "There are few contributing factors here. First, as people stay at home, these sectors are seeing more use of their products and services.", "Second, advertisers in these sectors tend to optimize for measurable objectives and we are generating sales at lower prices due to the overall reduction in ad demand.", "On the other hand, we've seen significant declines in travel and auto as these industries have been hit particularly hard.", "These trends are continuing in the first two weeks of Q2, and Dave will share more on this shortly. Companies of all types are adapting to a world where people aren't walking into their stores or seeing their brand on billboards.", "With more people spending time on our products and services than ever before, we are focused on continuing to deliver free and paid tools to help businesses reach the right people at the right time.", "And on finding new ways to support those struggling to keep the lights on and pay their employees.", "People are looking for businesses on Facebook and Instagram more than usual during this crisis. So our free products are particularly important to the many brick-and-mortar businesses pivoting quickly online.", "Even in the United States, before the crisis, one in three companies didn't have a website, because they can be expensive and difficult to set up even in the best of times.", "Our Facebook page or Instagram business profile is free and in a matter of minutes established as a digital storefront.", "Many are finding creative ways to engage their customers using our free products. From Jim's offering workouts on Facebook Live to stores and restaurants using WhatsApp and Messenger to reach customers with delivery options.", "In Thailand, when Penguin Eat Shabu closed the doors of its nine restaurants, they started selling to go boxes.", "They promoted them with Facebook posts and customers could order through Messenger and they got 350 sales in one minute.", "A second offer led to 2,500 hot pot sales. After initially putting their employees on unpaid leave, these sales increased their revenue and helped restore employees to full pay.", "Marketers of all sizes have more limited budgets. So they need to make every dollar work as hard as possible.", "That means measuring as hard as possible. That means measuring the value of their advertising is more important than ever, which is something our personalized ads provide.", "For years we have made major investments in systems and tools that enable businesses to easily understand their return on investment.", "In the current environment these investments are paying off.", "We are also launching new products to help businesses adapt to changing circumstances. Our teams moved quickly to make gift cards available on both Facebook and Instagram giving customers the option to support businesses by paying upfront for products and services they can use later.", "We also made it possible for people to create fundraisers for local businesses with a few simple click.", "Fundraisers have been available to support non-profits and people since 2015, but given the overwhelming interest in helping small businesses, weather the storm, we made these tools available for businesses as well, something we never expected to do.", "We also launched temporary service changes to make it easier for businesses to share critical information like inventory updates, shipment details, or new ways to buy.", "For example, if a restaurant needs to shift to a delivery model, they can now add food delivery links to their Facebook page or Instagram business profile.", "Trading these products quickly in the current environment wasn't easy and I am grateful to our product and engineering teams who are executing so well working from home.", "The business resource hub we launched in early May is a one-stop shop where businesses of all sizes can find support in virtual training that can help them migrate online.", "People can take courses on everything from how to connect with customers via messaging in Facebook Live, how to increase online sales.", "We are fortunate to be in a strong financial position. We can continue to pay all of our employees and contractors during this difficult time, which is why we believe we have a real responsibility to help others, especially small businesses around the world.", "In mid-March, we announced a $100 million grant program to help 30,000 small businesses across more than 30 countries we call home.", "Applications open this month and we are focused on getting cash into their hands as soon as possible.", "Economic crisis hit vulnerable communities the hardest, especially woman and women of color and the families who depend on them.", "That's why, half of the grants available in the US are earmarked for women minority and veteran owned businesses.", "We have also worked closely with the US government Small Business Administration to spread the word to small businesses about how to apply for relief loans reaching 30 million accounts across Facebook and Instagram with this information.", "Businesses aren't the only ones facing hardship, newsrooms are too. At a time when critical information is needed to keep community safe, news organizations are seeing steep declines in ad revenue.", "In late March, we announced a $100 million investment to support the news industry, with $25 million in grant funding for local news organizations and $75 million in marketing spend to get money to publishers.", "We have a responsibility to help during this uncertain time by connecting billions of people when they are separated physically, getting vital health information on a -- to people on a dramatic scale and helping small businesses survive.", "I want to close by saying how grateful I am to our partners and teams around the world. During this unprecedented time we are trying to stay closer than ever to businesses large and small as they adapt to these significant challenges.", "I also want to thank our teams for ensuring our services keep running and working so hard to launch new products, so we can continue making a real difference in people's lives.", "This is such a difficult period for everyone and we are grateful for the important work that is being accomplished by so many.", "Thanks Sheryl and good afternoon everyone. Echoing Mark and Sheryl's comments, my thoughts are with everyone facing challenges during this difficult and unprecedented time.", "Before turning to results, I wanted to comment briefly on Facebook's operating posture during the crisis.", "We took early action to ensure that all employee -- our employees were safe and moved to a global work from home stance on March 6 in the week prior to the WHO declaring COVID-19 a global pandemic.", "We are currently operating with over 95% of our full-time employees working from home with safety being the number one priority for those essential workers who need to come into our data centers and other facilities.", "We have been able to support our existing employees and on board new employees throughout this period.", "While we are by no means operating at 100% of capacity across every dimension of our operations, we have continued to ship new product releases, maintain service availability, review content and stay connected with our business customers.", "Given the circumstances, we have been pleased with the dedication and professionalism with which the Facebook team is tackling the challenges presented by this crisis.", "Now turning to the results. The COVID-19 pandemic is having a broad impact on our community metrics, revenue, expenses and business operations.", "Our community metrics reflected increased -- reflect increased engagement as people around the world of shelter-in-place.", "It's gratifying that people are using our family of apps to stay informed and connect with people and organizations that they care about.", "In March, we estimate that on average 2.3 billion people used at least one of our services on a daily basis and that approximately 3 billion people were active on a monthly basis.", "We have seen increased usage across all of our services, particularly in markets that have been most impacted by the virus, including a surge in video and voice calling on Messenger and WhatsApp.", "People around the world have increasingly turned to Facebook as well. Daily active users reached 1.73 billion, up 11% compared to last year.", "DAUs represented approximately 67% of the 2.6 billion monthly active users in March. MAUs grew 228 million or 10% compared to last year.", "We expect that we will lose some of this increased engagement when shelter-in-place restrictions are relaxed and life returns to a more normal cadence, which we all look forward to.", "Turning now to the financials. Q1 total revenue was $17.7 billion, up 18% or 19% on a constant currency basis.", "Had foreign exchange rates remained constant with Q1 of last year, total revenue would have been $275 million higher.", "Q1 ad revenue was $17.4 billion, up 17% or 19% on a constant currency basis. Again, the COVID-19 pandemic had an meaningful impact on our revenue.", "Revenue was strong from the beginning of the quarter through the first week of March, when we began to see a steep slowdown in our ads business, particularly in countries that implemented shelter-in-place measures to reduce the spread of the virus.", "As Sheryl mentioned there was a great deal of variability by vertical. During the last three weeks of March, travel and auto were our weakest verticals and we saw relative strength in gaming technology and e-commerce.", "These trends have continued into Q2. We've seen relatively comparable pullbacks among large and small advertisers.", "COVID-19 had an impact across the globe in Q1. On a regional basis ad revenue growth was strongest in Asia Pacific at 21%, followed by US, Canada, Europe and Rest of World at 16% each.", "Turning now to our price and volume metrics. In Q1, the total number of ad impressions served across our services increased 39% and the average price per ad decreased 16%.", "The growth of impressions was primarily driven by Facebook Mobile newsfeed, due to product optimizations we made prior to the pandemic as well as from increased engagement that I talked about earlier.", "The decline in average price per ad was largely attributed -- attributable to the reduction in advertiser demand during the last three weeks of March.", "Other revenue, was $297 million, up 80% driven primarily by sales of Oculus products. As a reminder, we launched Quest in May 2019.", "Turning now to expenses. Q1 total expenses were $11.8 billion, up 1% on a reported basis. Excluding the $3 billion expense we recorded in Q1 related to our settlement with the FTC, Q1 of last year that is, related to our settlement with the FTC, total expenses were up 35% year-over-year.", "Cost of revenue increased 23% driven primarily by depreciation related to our infrastructure spend. R&D grew 40% and was driven primarily by investments in core product as well as our innovation efforts particularly in AR/VR.", "Marketing and sales grew 38% and was driven by consumer and growth marketing. Finally, excluding the FTC expense from Q1 of 2019, G&A grew 49%, driven partially by an increase in estimated credit losses related to COVID-19.", "We had over 3,300 net new hires in Q1, primarily in technical functions and ended the quarter with over 48,000 full-time employees, up 28% compared to last year.", "As I mentioned earlier, we continue to recruit and onboard new employees successfully while in a work-from-home environment.", "Operating income was $5.9 billion representing a 33% operating margin and our tax rate was 16%.

With the COVID-19 crisis like all companies we are facing a period of unprecedented uncertainty in our business outlook, certainly in the nearly eight years I've been with Facebook.", "We expect our business performance will be impacted by issues beyond our control, including the duration and efficacy of shelter-in-place orders, the effectiveness of economic stimuli around the world and the fluctuation of currencies relative to the US dollar.", "On the latter point alone, since the WHO declared COVID-19 as a pandemic, we have seen in the US dollar appreciate 5% relative to the foreign currencies we do business in.", "Given the increasing uncertainty in our business outlook, we are not providing specific revenue guidance for the second quarter or full year 2020, rather, I would like to provide a snapshot of revenue performance in the second quarter thus far.", "There is a tremendous amount of macro uncertainty.

Our significant investments in infrastructure over the past four years have served us well during this period of high user engagement.", "We plan to continue to grow our capex investments to enhance and expand our global infrastructure footprint over the long-term.", "In 2020, we now expect capital expenditures to be approximately $14 billion to $16 billion, down from our prior range of $17 billion to $19 billion.", "This reduction reflects a significant decrease in our construction efforts related to shelter-in-place orders.", "Given the strong engagement growth and related demands on our infrastructure, this year's capex reduction should be viewed as a deferral into 2021 rather than savings.", "Turning now to tax. We expect our full year 2020 tax rate will be in the high teens, although we may see fluctuations in our quarterly rate depending on our financial results.", "Our thoughts are with those in the community who are facing health challenges during this crisis and with those healthcare workers on the front lines.", "We are also mindful of the challenges many businesses are facing in this crisis, including the 140 million small businesses who use our platform.", "Our focus is first and foremost on helping our broad community navigate these challenges.", "We will now open the lines for a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Brian Nowak from Morgan Stanley.", "Thanks for taking my questions. Hope everyone is safe. I have two. Just the -- the first one for Sheryl or Dave.", "I appreciate all the color on the different ad verticals between gaming, e-commerce, travel and autos, etc.", "I guess I'd be curious to hear about sort of what happened in the decline in the ad business you saw in March compared to the stability in April, sort of what changed in those verticals?", "And then understanding you're not giving guidance, but talk to us about some of the key verticals that would be needed to sort of bring the business back to growth as we go throughout the year?", "And then the second question for Mark, you talkied a little bit about SMBs, I'm curious to hear about some of the key investment areas and initiatives you really think you need to execute on to make the SMB offering more comprehensive in '21 and beyond?", "Yes, sure. Sorry. We're doing our coordination. So, Brian, yes, the trends that we saw in the end of Q1, we saw a pull back pretty broad based pulled back, especially concentrated in some of the areas to be talked about things like travel and auto.", "But really kind of broad-based, large and small advertisers. We saw a relative strength even then in a few categories like gaming, where you have always on campaigns that we're able to pick up some supply, because the lower pricing kind of cleared at the levels that those advertisers were trying to acquire users at so that is one of the benefits of the auction.", "And then e-commerce, we've seen -- it was not a strong as gaming. But we've seen that show signs of stability as well.", "And all of those trends sort of continued into -- in the Q2, so I don't think there's a lot of vertical shifts, but I think we see an e-commerce sort of do reasonably well.", "What we're seeing is really I think pretty straightforward. We're seeing people who are driving toward online conversion events do well, because they're able to kind of bid in the auction and get those users and get those results that they're looking for.", "And people who are like looking for offline or more top of funnel brand, there we've seen more pullback in stance.", "To your second question on SMBs. There's really two parts to this. One is, what are we doing now to help SMBs weather the storm and come back to business and be able to pay their employees.", "And the second is the ongoing ad work we do. On the first, I think we've been really focused. We came out early with our $100 million grants program and we're rolling it out very aggressively around the world, trying to get money to people very quickly.", "And we're building specialized products, we never would have thought of before. Fundraisers were something that we did for non-profits or people not small businesses.", "So in this very difficult time for SMBs, we're really focused on doing everything we can to help them survive and even thrive as they help transition online.", "SMBs are also a major part of our business going forward. And on there, it's really the execution we do quarter-after-quarter to make our ads perform.", "We offer very personalized ads that can be directly targeted at small groups. We do that in a very privacy protective way and those ads are often most important for small businesses who can't afford to buy broad based media.", "And so all of the work we do to continue to allow targeting, all of the work we do to make the ads more personalized, all of the work we do to make free tools available, which is important for all the online businesses who use our free tools.", "There are 140 million of them, as well as the 8 million, who are our advertisers, and the funnel between those.", "That's the nuts and bolts of our business. We work on it every day. We're continuing to work on it every day through this crisis and we'll continue beyond that.", "Your next question comes from the line of Doug Anmuth from JP Morgan.", "Great. Thanks for taking the question. I have two, I think probably both for Mark. First, I was hoping you could talk more about the functionality of WhatsApp and perhaps other platforms as you expand in India with the Jio platforms partnership.", "There are other markets where you could see something similar or is this strategy here unique to India?", "And then second, just given the increased engagement with communication tools and voice and video in particular, how is that translating into increased activity in the feed and within stories?", "Mark Zuckerberg -- Founder, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Sure, I can speak to the first one and David can see if there are any stats in particular to share on the second one.", "I mean for commerce on WhatsApp more broadly, we're very focused on making it, so that small businesses can have a presence on all of the apps, right, Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp and Messenger and can communicate organically with people and then increasingly can do things that can help them drive transactions.", "So we started rolling out things like catalogs in WhatsApp, we're working on payments to be able to complete transactions and we've rolled out a new ad format, click to messaging ads, where basically a lot of small businesses and different businesses are finding that their message threads with people perform better for driving sales than their websites or other presences, they basically buy ads inside Facebook or Instagram and send people through chat threads.", "And then as we build out all these tools around that around making those threads more valuable. We think that those ads will only increase in value, which is the way we're currently thinking about that business.", "In India with Jio. Jio has had this vision for a while, I want to be careful not to put words in their mouth, but just from what they've basically described both to us and publicly, about their JioMart vision is there are millions of small businesses and shops across India and they want to try to help get them on to a single network that you'll be able to communicate with through WhatsApp and do payments online through WhatsApp.", "So I think of that is a great, very large example of how we can wire up and help small businesses in the country where we have the largest WhatsApp community.", "But certainly all the products and technology that we're building to enable that partnership are going to be things that we want to do around the world.", "So we're very excited about working with them to drive this vision forward and then extending it everywhere over the coming months and years.", "Dave, I don't know if you want to say anything about the second point. I think it's at a high level, I mean you may have stats that you want to share.", "But I think it's, we have seen a broad-based increase in use of the products. It's hard to know what is just correlated with the pandemic versus people are doing more video chat or messaging, so therefore they also connect more in other parts of the products, but I do think, overall, we believe that providing a broad set of social tools for people is -- and just providing more value for people does include all of the different services which is important because as you know, some of the services for our business we include ads in and some we don't.", "Yes. And the only thing I'd add there is, we talked about 39% increase in ad impressions and that's really driven by engagement increases on our feed products and stories products as well as the search that we've seen in the video and messaging.", "So it really wasn't limited to video and messaging, it was broad-based as Mark said, and that's creating supply on the ad impression side as well.", "Your next question comes from Justin Post from Bank of America Merrill Lynch.", "Justin Post -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst", "Great, thanks. Sheryl maybe you could talk a little bit about the ad auction dynamics. Are you seeing e-commerce and digital replace auto and other categories and how efficiently is that auction working?", "And secondly, can you give us any color on percent of ads that come from direct response versus brand or maybe CPC bidding versus CPM?", "I can take that Justin. In terms of the ad auction dynamics, yes, I mean, we are seeing, when verticals doing better than the other or people fall out of the auction we have very dynamic content, it's --", "and so we're able to backfill that with other bids from other clients. So we're seeing a lot of bidding into the system from gaming and e-commerce as prices come down it's also more economic and they can get the ROIs that they want.", "So it's a natural way in which those -- that happens and you see a replacement effect there. So that's working well.", "Far more -- by far the majority of our revenue we haven't given a specific number on what is direct response.", "But it's really for many years driven our business. It continues to drive our business and I would say if anything COVID is accentuated the importance of people who are bidding for online conversions and so I think we've seen a fall-off in some of the more sort of broad-based brand advertising right now and really a focus on those things that are driving direct results today, which isn't really surprising given the economic climate.", "Your next question comes from the line of Ross Sandler from Barclays.", "Hey guys. Just a follow-up to the last question. I think about four years ago, you mentioned that the top 100 advertisers were just under 25% of revenue and coming down.", "So I guess, how does that mix look today? And Dave, I think you mentioned, large and small advertisers were kind of pulling back in March and into April at about the same rate, but any more pronounced desal from large versus small.", "Any color there? And then second question is Mark, you mentioned in your opening remarks that something along the lines of high margins are important to the company, especially given the economic environment.", "So how do you think about balancing levels of investment with revenue over the long-term. As you're thinking around that changed versus I think you mentioned that comment maybe two years ago, has anything changed in the way you're thinking about margins?", "Hey, Ross, it's Dave. I'll take that first one. Yes, we've seen sort of a pullback of advertising from both large and small advertisers.", "And I would say, given the uncertain economic climate, we know SMBs are getting hit hard, but our business is quite diversified and there is no one size fits all for SMBs.", "We've got some businesses that are obviously suffering greatly from the shelter-in-place orders and then we have SMBs, who are also digital natives and have online objectives and those are doing relatively better.", "So we've got SMBs, who are in gaming and e-commerce and the like. So we are seeing I think a fairly diverse range of SMBs.", "And I would say in terms of the diversity of our business that's, that remains very high. We're not concentrated.", "But we haven't updated that specific stat that we gave back four years ago. We remain very diversified from an advertiser perspective.", "Mark Zuckerberg -- Founder, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "And I can talk to the margins a bit. Overall, I think during a period like this there are a lot of new things that need to get built.", "And I think it's important that rather than slamming on the brakes now, as I think a lot of companies may, that it's important to keep on building and keep on investing in building for the new need that people have and especially to make up for some of the stuffs that that other companies would pullback on, and I think that's in some ways that's an opportunity, in other ways, I think it's responsibility to keep on investing in the economic recovery.", "But the other reflection that I've had is that, I think if you're going to have a business, which is primarily advertising, which is our plan for the long-term, then I think you have to recognize that advertising is more volatile and sensitive to the macro economy, and therefore if you're going to have this kind of a business, I think you really want to maintain high margins.", "So that way when we go through periods like this, you can make sure that we remain stable and healthy and able to keep on building the things that are important for the long term.", "So what I guess I'd want to just be clear on is that, we are willing to accept a reduction in margins in the near term, but we understand and I personally have an appreciation for the importance of maintaining high margins over time.", "So it's not that we're going to kind of take things down this year and then continue taking things down a lot in the future.", "I think over the coming years if we invest a lot more now, I think we are going to look for ways to manage expenses to make sure that we can maintain high margins over time.", "Your next question comes from the line of Youssef Squali from SunTrust.", "Youssef Squali -- SunTrust Robinson Humphrey -- Analyst", "Great. Thank you very much. Two questions. Mark, can you discuss the performance of your gaming platform including Oculus so far.", "How satisfied are you with the traction there? And what are you doing to better position the company to take advantage of the increased engagement we're seeing on other platforms, continuing platforms", "and maybe Dave or Sheryl, can you speak to the trend you're seeing in markets where COVID-19 hit earlier say may be January and February, and how they are performing today and any learnings from these markets?", "Mark Zuckerberg -- Founder, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Sure. So I can talk a bit about games. We have a few big areas of investment here. One is just in our mobile apps, massive amount of growth in live streaming.", "That's -- I talked about live video in my opening remarks and people live streaming gaming content is certainly one big category that's growing quickly and that we're investing a lot in.", "So that I think is going quite well. We recently had some pretty big launches of an app in that area, and we're going to keep on investing there.", "Then on the virtual reality side, this has always been a long-term vision. Quest has has surpassed our expectations.", "I wish we can make more of them faster during this period. I do think that it's one of those areas where as people can't go out into the world as much, the ability to have technology that allows us to be physically present or feel present even when we can be physically together, whether that's Quest or Portal or any of the software that we're building around video presence that stuff is certainly seen especially large spikes in usage and it's possible that this brings accelerate some of the trends around adoption of things like virtual or augmented reality.", "But I'm not sure what will happen there long-term? But in the near term, I'm quite pleased with how Quest is doing and I wish we could make more of them.", "Youssef, I'll take the second part of that question. So I think it's probably the market that would be most instructive would be a market like China, but I think for us China is a bit different, because we don't have users in China.", "So the business there is China-based advertisers reaching people outside of China. So it's hard to extrapolate too much from that.", "We did see a pullback of revenue in China earlier in the quarter, and we have seen a recovery there, and a recovery -- but one thing that's hard to know is part of that is really kind of mixed up in the vertical -- verticals as well.", "China tends to for us index pretty highly with gaming and e-commerce and those segments that are driven toward online outcomes, where we're seeing relative strength.", "So it's hard to really read too much into the experience.", "Your next question comes from the line of Eric Sheridan from UBS.", "Thanks for taking the question. Maybe two if I can. One bigger picture one dovetailing all the comments around e-commerce.", "I'm curious if there's anything you're seeing in terms of the behavior of users on the platform that would make you want to accelerate or change the path of product development to capture some of the supply and demand you might be seeing as people want to sell in an omnichannel world and some of the demand that might be there on the buyer side to connect e-commerce broadly across Facebook's properties as an output of the current environment?", "And then Dave, maybe if I could just ask one quickly, I don't think you called it out, but I am curious if you could identify the credit loss assumption in the quarter and what the number might have been or is that something we might have to wait for the 10-Q for?", "Mark do you want to take the e-commerce or you want me to do both.", "Mark Zuckerberg -- Founder, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "I mean I can talk to it briefly and then you can add to it if you think that there is more. We are seeing increases in some of the consumer behavior around this, but I think the bigger thing is just that for all the small businesses that we serve and a lot of small businesses that are out there that are still primarily physical, there is a -- there has been a big push to get online and to do more selling online.", "And I think there are lots of opportunities for us to support them in building the tools that they need to do this.", "We're seeing a lot of businesses that work primarily physical.", "Now moving toward selling stuff online for the first time, and we're seeing a lot of businesses that already had a digital presence, now really transitioned to having their digital presence be primarily -- be their primary presence.", "And that, I think that that trend, while there may be some short-term spike, I do think plays into a pre-existing long-term trend.", "And we'll certainly want to accelerate that aspect of our product road map to make sure that we can serve a lot of those businesses during this period when it can help them with the recovery and get through this.", "So we're working on a lot of work streams there. We'll hopefully have more to share over the coming weeks.", "Yes. Eric, on the bad debt expense that increased by $193 million. So that will be the number that's in the Q and the majority of that relates to charges.", "Obviously that we're taking related to the COVID-19 pandemic in our views on collectability of certain accounts in that environment.", "Your next question comes from the line of Mark Mahaney from RBC.", "Thanks. Two questions. Mark at the very beginning, you talked about the economic fallout possibly lasting longer than people think.", "Just any detail behind that. Is there something you're seeing in the datas that you've got reaction? And then following up a little bit on Eric Sheridan's question, these kind of events, crises can create new, I don't know paths or whatever.", "So you talked about shopping. What about WhatsApp there's a surge in usage of WhatsApp. Is there something that's happened that makes it more interesting more -- for long-term more interesting as a monetization vehicle because of the surge and usage of WhatsApp.", "Mark Zuckerberg -- Founder, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Yes, I can take those two. I think that we'll see a meaningful economic hit if I had to predict for the period of the health emergency.", "And so I think that as Dave said in his comments, the efficacy of the shelter-in-place orders and how well that's going, I think will be a big determinant of how long and how painful the economic fallout is from this.", "So there is certainly a range of outcomes that I don't think I have any particular insight that that's not public or that you don't have.", "But I worry that this could be worse than at least some people are predicting.", "The other question was monetization on WhatsApp. I think that there is a huge opportunity on WhatsApp if for no other reason than that it has 2 billion people using it and we haven't done significant work on building out the business yet.", "I mean we have some tools there, but we're still early in the phase of -- we've built out WhatsApp Business.", "There is tens of millions of businesses that are signed up and that are using that. So it's -- there is tremendous demand people want to communicate with businesses and we've been in the process of building out the infrastructure to do payments and more commerce, ad units like what I mentioned around quick to messaging ads are performing well.", "So I think all the indicators are positive. But it's just a generally untapped opportunity so far, and one that we are that I think it's very exciting to build out over the coming years.", "I think Deborah is trying to say that there is one last question.", "Deborah Crawford -- Vice President, Investor Relations", "Your last question comes from the line of Colin Sebastian from Baird.", "Great. Thanks for taking my question. I guess first, Dave, I was hoping, I know this is not a key focus right now but any updated thoughts or timeline on some of the targeting and measurement headline -- headwinds that you spoke about on the last call?", "And then with respect to both the ongoing investment priorities as well as the slower growth in headcount, is there any way you could articulate which areas are seeing that slowdown versus those that are getting full support?", "Sure, Colin, I can take both of those. Yes, I mean the targeting headwinds are having an impact on the business, but obviously that's dwarfed by the impact that COVID-19 is having right now.", "We continue to see the three factors around targeting, and this hasn't changed the regulatory pressures with GDPR and CPPA and similar regulations.", "The moves by platforms that make third-party targeting and measurement more difficult, and then our own moves on launching privacy controls.", "So, these are impacting the whole industry, and we believe we're relatively well positioned. We've got a lot of first-party signal.", "That said, I think this will have a broad impact on return on investment and could affect what advertisers are able to find and acquire customers effectively for their businesses, may not be able to grow as quickly as they otherwise could and that could have a negative impact on their growth in the economy and obviously revenue for us.", "So certainly, it's a challenging time to make it tougher for businesses to grow, but we're certainly -- continue to have that headwind in the longer term.", "Deborah Crawford -- Vice President, Investor Relations", "And I'm sorry, I forgot investment priorities. We're continuing to focus on recruiting on the tax side.", "So product and engineering. So we're sort of fully going down that path. That's was our core product and innovation efforts.", "And we are slowing down headcount in business function. So some of the functions related to things like advertising sales is slower in those departments, given the overall economic climate.", "And then there are certain areas that we're just finding efficiencies, there's less travel, there's less entertainment.", "And I think that may persist for quite some time. So we're seeing savings there and we're going to be looking at getting marketing efficiencies, because obviously prices are coming down on the marketing front, so that we can get the same impact for less dollars and also look for efficiencies on marketing spend.", "Deborah Crawford -- Vice President, Investor Relations", "Right. Thank you for joining us today. We appreciate your time. Stay safe everybody and we look forward to speaking with you again.", "Deborah Crawford -- Vice President, Investor Relations", "Mark Zuckerberg -- Founder, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Justin Post -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst", "Youssef Squali -- SunTrust Robinson Humphrey -- Analyst"]}

past year, with more than 366 million new users coming online since we published our Digital 2018 reports.", "Our latest internet data – collected and synthesised from a wide variety of reputable sources – shows that internet users are growing at a rate of more than 11 new users per second, which results in that impressive total of one million new users each day.", "It’s worth noting that some of this growth may be attributable to more up-to-date reporting of user numbers, but that doesn’t detract from the implications of this growth.", "We’re particularly encouraged to see that a significant proportion of this year’s growth has come from developing economies, with countries that previously suffered from lacklustre internet penetration posting some strong gains as we start 2019.", "The standout story here is India, which has seen internet users jump by almost 100 million in the past 12 months, representing annual growth of more than 20 percent.", "Internet penetration in the South Asian country now stands at roughly 41 percent – a considerable improvement over the 31 percent that we reported this time last year.", "These big numbers mean that India is responsible

is also more than double the figure of 2.08 billion that we reported in our first Global Digital report back in January 2012.", "For context, it’s worth noting that the World Wide Web turns 30 this year. Although many people’s connected activities now rely on recent innovations like native mobile apps, the Web still represents ‘the internet’ for most users around the world.", "Data from the ITU suggest that it took roughly 16 years for the internet to reach its first billion users, but just another six years for it to reach two billion.", "However, the data in our Digital 2019 reports suggest that the internet is now growing at a rate of one billion new users every 2.7 years.", "That rate isn’t sustainable of course – at some point, everyone in the world who wants to connect to the internet will do so – but I wonder if Tim Berners-Lee could even have dreamt of the fact that his handy little tool for sharing research findings would reach almost 4½ billion people by its thirtieth birthday.", "The ways in which people use the internet are evolving quickly too, with mobile accounting for an ever-increasing share of our online activities.", "We’ll dig into the specifics of mobile and app use in the dedicated mobile section below, but it’s worth noting here that mobile phones now account for almost half the time that people spend on the internet.", "On average, the world’s internet users spend 6 hours and 42 minutes online each day. That’s down slightly on last year’s figure of 6 hours and 49 minutes, but our suspicion is that this drop may be in part due to the large number of new users who are still learning how to use the internet, and who use the internet less than those more seasoned users who turn to their connected devices hundreds of times each day.", "Despite the year-on-year drop, our online time quickly adds up. An average of more than 6½ hours a day equates to a total of more than 100 days of online time each year for every internet user.", "If we extend that average across the total internet user base of almost 4.4 billion users, we find that humanity will spend a collective total of more than 1.2 billion years online in 2019.", "The good news is that faster connections mean we’re achieving more in our online time.

Data from SimilarWeb suggest that, in 2019 alone, people will spend more than 1 billion days of collective human time on just the top 5 adult sites.", "Oh, and in case you’re wondering, the average visit lasts just over 10 minutes…", "More broadly, video is becoming an increasingly important part of our internet activities. Google searches for the word ‘video’ increased by 30 percent over the past year, and the query now ranks fourth amongst all global queries, behind Facebook, YouTube, and Google.", "[As an aside, if you’re wondering why people search for Google on Google, it’s all to do with using the address bar as a search input].", "GlobalWebIndex reports that 92 percent of internet users now watch videos online each month, meaning that more than 4 billion people around the world are consuming online video content in early 2019.", "For context, roughly 6 billion people around the world have a television set at home, based on data reported by the ITU.", "Games have become a huge part of the internet too, from simple mobile games to complex MMORPGs. GlobalWebIndex’s data also indicates that more than 1 billion people around the world now stream games over the internet each month, with games like Fortnite becoming global phenomena.", "People are spending an increasing amount of time watching other people play games online, too. The latest numbers indicate that almost a quarter of all internet users – more than 1 billion people – watch livestreams of other people playing games each month.", "Meanwhile, more than 700 million people will watch e-sports in 2019 – that’s double the number of people who watched Formula 1 in 2017.", "The ways in which people ‘interface’ with the internet are changing too. The use of voice control tools increased significantly during 2018, with roughly four in every ten internet users now using voice commands or voice search every month.", "Crucially, roughly half of all internet users in China and India now use voice control, and with these two markets being top priorities for developers, we can expect to see even stronger growth in the use of voice tech during 2019.", "Our full suite of Digital 2019 reports includes extensive insights into people’s use of the world’s top social platforms in more than 230 countries and territories around the world.", "These in-depth numbers tell a mixed story though, with some platforms showing impressive growth over the past 12 months, and others starting to lose ground.", "Worldwide social media user numbers have grown to almost 3.5 billion at the start of 2019, with 288 million new users in the past 12 months pushing the global penetration figure to 45 percent.", "Social media use is still far from evenly distributed across the globe though, and penetration rates in parts of Africa are still in the single digits.", "Countries in the Middle East top the social media penetration rankings again this year, with the United Arab Emirates and Qatar tied for top spot.", "In some cases, the individual platform figures reported in these countries actually exceed the total population figures published by the United Nations, but this is likely because both countries have significant expat communities that are not included in ‘official’ local population figures.", "At the other end of the scale, North Korea continues to languish in last place in the global social media rankings, with a penetration figure of less than 0.1 percent.", "This is perhaps unsurprising though, considering that the internet – or at least the internet as the rest of the world knows it – remains blocked throughout the country.", "We also suspect that the figures for Turkmenistan may actually be higher than those reported here, but we have been unable to source data from the county’s top platform (imo).", "African nations make up the remainder of the bottom 10 countries by social media penetration, and a number of countries across the region actually registered declines in social media use over the past 12 months.", "However, comparisons to total population are less representative when it comes to social media, because most platforms prohibit use by children.", "As a result, this year’s reports also include analysis of what we’re terming ‘eligible penetration’ – i.e. social media use amongst adults aged 13 and above.", "Considering that almost 40 percent of the total population in some parts of Africa is below the age of 13, this has a meaningful impact on the overall social media picture.", "The number of social media users around the world at the start of 2019 equates to roughly 58 percent of the total ‘eligible population’, but this figure rises to more than 70 percent in almost 100 countries around the world.", "In a number of countries, the total number of social media ‘users’ actually exceeds the total eligible population by a considerable margin.", "We’ve capped our eligible penetration figures at 99 percent though, because it’s unrealistic to expect that everybody in a country uses social media, and it’s also likely that some of these ‘users’ will represent duplicate accounts.", "Even when adjusted for age, however, social media penetration in many parts of the developing world still lags below 30 percent, and 16 countries around the world still register less than 10 percent eligible penetration.", "The good news is that many countries have shown strong growth in social media use over the past 12 months.", "Just as in the internet growth rankings above, Western Sahara posted the fastest social media growth during 2018, with the number of active users in the country increasing by more than 4½ times", "[note: in the absence of other data, we use active social media user numbers as a proxy for internet users in Western Sahara, which is why the numbers are the same].", "Ethiopia has also seen impressive growth this year, with an additional 2.3 million new users translating to annual growth of more than 60 percent.", "Encouragingly, Cuba has also witnessed strong social media growth this year, despite internet access remaining a challenge across the country.", "China added the greatest number of new social media users over the past 12 months, with the country’s total rising by close to 100 million new users since this time last year.", "The latest data suggest that more than 1 billion people in China now use social media, although we suspect that this figure is somewhat inflated by duplicate accounts.", "India also saw strong growth, with more than 60 million users signing up to social media for the first time during 2018.", "Meanwhile, despite a flurry of restrictions on social media platforms in recent months, the number of people using social media in Iran has also grown considerably in the past year.", "The team at Techrasa and local social media expert Niki Aghaei both concurred that annual user growth is well into double digits, and even official government sources have reported strong growth.", "The five-year growth figures for social media users are even more striking than those for internet use, with the global social media user total almost doubling since our Digital 2014 reports.", "This year’s total of 3.49 billion is also just over 2 billion higher than the 1.48 billion we reported in our first Global Digital report back in January 2012.", "The global social media audience has also matured considerably during that time, with people around the age of 30 now accounting for the largest share of the world’s social media users.", "Senior audiences are now better represented too, and Facebook’s various platforms report a greater number of users over the age of 55 than users below the age of 18.", "There’s still a meaningful gender imbalance across overall social media audiences too, but – as we’ll see below – this varies markedly at the individual platform level.", "In general, countries with the lowest overall social media penetration are also those countries with the greatest male skew.", "While these figures are specific to social media users, they’re likely representative of broader internet use too, which suggests that women suffer from poor levels of internet access in many parts of the developing world.", "As an essential resource for education, financial inclusion, employment and empowerment, ensuring more equal internet access for women must be a priority for the next phase of internet development.", "The amount of time that people spend on social media has increased again this year, albeit very slightly.", "GlobalWebIndex reports that the average social media user now spends 2 hours and 16 minutes each day on social platforms – up from 2 hours and 15 minutes last year – which equates to roughly one-third of their total internet time, and one-seventh of their waking lives.", "As with internet use, this time quickly adds up: if we extend this average daily time across all 3.484 billion people using social media today, we get a combined total of almost 330 million years of human time spent on social platforms during the course of 2019.", "It’s worth noting that the time spent on social media varies considerably across cultures though, with internet users in Japan spending an average of just 36 minutes on social media each day.", "At the other end of the scale, Filipinos continue to spend the most time on social media, with this year’s average of 4 hours and 12 minutes reflecting an increase of 15 minutes per day (6 percent)

The platform has lost one in every seven of its US advertising audience since October 2018, and Snapchat’s total advertising audience in the country has now dropped below 100 million.", "My assessment of these numbers is that what previously made Snapchat appealing may also be contributing to its present declines.", "The platform has consistently appeared to focus on younger users – particularly those in the 13 to 24 year-old age bracket.", "However, people in these age groups tend to be more fickle in their social media behaviours, and while this targeted approach may have served Snapchat well in previous years, the platform seems to be struggling to maintain its appeal amongst its core audiences.", "Crucially, Instagram now boasts almost twice as many users as Snapchat in the same age bracket – and Instagram’s numbers are still growing.", "Furthermore, unlike Twitter, there’s little evidence in other data to hint at a remedy for Snapchat’s ails.", "The focused functionality of Snapchat’s platform was part of its initial success, but that focus leaves the company with fewer options now that the strategy seems to be delivering less favourable returns.", "So, once again, I’ll concur with the predictions of Prof Galloway: there’s a good chance that Snapchat will rethink its prior aversion to acquisition over the coming months.", "Fortunately, we return to good news in our analysis of LinkedIn. The world’s favourite professional social network delivered strong results over the past year, with the platform’s total addressable advertising audience growing by more than 3 percent in the last quarter of 2018 alone.", "It’s important to note that LinkedIn’s advertising audience numbers are based on total registered users, and not the monthly active users reported in other platform’s tools.", "However, the company’s latest data show that advertisers can now reach more than 600 million users around the world on LinkedIn, which tells a compelling story for brands hoping to connect with working professionals across the globe.", "LinkedIn has also seen strong growth across individual countries in recent months. The largest percentage change is in Myanmar, where the platform added roughly 80,000 new users in the past three months.", "LinkedIn has also delivered strong growth across many parts of developing Africa, but it’s worth noting that the overall audience sizes in many of these countries is still relatively small.", "LinkedIn is also growing in many developed markets, despite starting from a strong base. The company’s latest advertising data show that users grew by 14 percent in Japan in the past quarter, and by 13 percent in both South Korea and Singapore, despite the latter already ranking in LinkedIn’s top 20 countries by eligible penetration (note that we’re using adults aged 18+ for LinkedIn’s eligible audience, rather than the 13+ we’ve used for the other platforms).", "The world’s favourite video platform doesn’t share in-depth insights into its advertising audiences, but this year’s reports include some other YouTube data points that marketers will find useful.", "Much of this data points to the fact that music is the top draw for YouTube audiences, especially in the platform’s high-growth markets.", "Music-related topics accounted for half of the top 20 search queries for on YouTube during 2018, with users in Thailand searching so frequently for music-related content that the local word for ‘song’ – เพลง – appears at number 13 in the global top 20 rankings.", "Movies and ‘TV content’ accounted for much of the rest of the list, but it’s worth noting that the games Fortnite and Minecraft both attracted huge volumes of interest on YouTube throughout 2018.", "Music videos account for nine out of YouTube’s ten all-time most-watched videos, with Despacito amassing close to 6 billion total views by the time of writing.", "PewDiePie retains top spot in the global YouTube account rankings, but – as has been reported widely in the media, and to the alarm of legions of PewDiePie fans – he’s at risk of losing this mantle to T-Series, an Indian music label and movie studio.", "Unfortunately, WeChat, LINE, and VKontakte all declined our requests for more detailed insights into their worldwide audiences, so we’re unable to provide any richer insights for these platforms beyond headline user numbers.", "As always though, we’re hopeful that this situation may change, so if anyone from those companies is reading this and would like to share data for future reports, please get in touch.", "The number of people around the world who use a mobile phone increased by 100 million in 2018, with the global total reaching more than 5.1 billion users by January 2019.", "This figure brings worldwide mobile penetration to 67 percent – more than two-thirds of the total global population.", "Sadly, Google hasn’t published an update to its Consumer Barometer study in the past year, so we’re unable to report new data for unique mobile users by country.", "However, we do have all the latest numbers for mobile connections around the world, thanks to GSMA Intelligence.", "It’s worth noting that GSMA Intelligence has revised its figures since last year though, so the numbers in this year’s report won’t be directly comparable to those we reported in our Digital 2018 reports.", "In particular, the figure for unique mobile users we’re quoting this year is lower than the number we published last year, but – based on GSMA Intelligence’s revised dataset – this year’s figure actually represents growth of 100 million new users versus January 2018.", "The number of mobile connections around the world has grown by more than 4 percent in the past twelve months, reaching more than 8.8 billion at the start of 2019.", "However, the typical mobile user around the world now has an average of 1.73 mobile connections, so we must be careful not to misinterpret connections as unique users.", "The latest data from Ericsson suggest that smartphones now account for two-thirds of global mobile connections, indicating that almost 5.5 billion smartphones are in use around the world today.", "That’s a considerable change versus this time last year, with the latest data suggesting annual growth of nine percent.", "Compared to the same data for 2018, this equates to an additional 450 million smartphones in use today versus this time last year.", "Close to 2.5 billion ‘feature phone’ handsets are still in use around the world though, while connections associated with PCs, tablets, and mobile routers have reached 270 million.", "The percentage of mobile connections that can be classed as ‘broadband’ – i.e. 3G and above – has increased significantly since early 2018, with a relative year-on-year increase of more than 16 percent.", "Almost half of all mobile connections around the world are now 4G (LTE), according to reports from the Global Mobile Suppliers Association (GSMA), and the number of LTE subscriptions jumped by almost 50 percent in the year to July 2018.", "Three-quarters of the world’s mobile users pay for their connections via top-ups rather than paying by monthly instalments, down slightly from the 76 percent we reported this time last year.", "However, the picture varies from one extreme to the other across the globe.", "Total mobile connections have continued to grow steadily over the past 5 years, with operators activating more than 2.2 billion new connections during that time.", "However, with the rollout of new 5G networks over the next few years, industry experts predict that connection growth will start to accelerate as the demand for IoT connections increases.", "With roughly 5.5 billion smartphones in use across the world today, it’s little surprise that the mobile app market is booming.", "The latest data from App Annie show that app downloads increased by 9 percent over the past 12 months, reaching close to 200 billion total downloads for full-year 2018.", "What’s more, people are spending considerably more on apps too. App Annie reports that the world’s smartphone users spent more than US$100 billion on apps in 2018 alone.", "Comparing this against the number of smartphones in use around the world that Ericsson reports for 2018, this would mean that the average smartphone user now spends more than US$20 on apps each year, and this figure is even higher in more developed economies.", "Mobile games continue to dominate app stores, with the category achieving top spot for both downloads and revenues across both the Google Play and iOS stores in 2018.", "Many of the local reports in our broader Digital 2019 suite offer detailed insights into top apps by country, but here are the top global apps and games by monthly active users for full-year 2018:", "Perhaps unsurprisingly, this surge in app usage has contributed to a significant increase in the amount of mobile data we consume, too.", "Ericsson’s latest Mobility Report shows that the world now consumes more than 20 billion gigabytes of mobile data each month, while data in the company’s Mobility Visualizer tool indicates that the average smartphone device now consumes almost 7GB of mobile data every month.", "Still with me? Phew. I warned you this would be a long one.", "We’ll finish this year’s analysis on another high point. The latest data from Statista’s Digital Market Outlook studies show that e-commerce spend has grown by 14 percent year-on year, with the company estimating that full-year 2018 spend on consumer goods alone topped US$1.78 trillion.", "It’s important to note that Statista has revised all of its e-commerce data since our Digital 2018 reports, so – once again – these numbers will not be directly comparable to the figures in last year’s reports.", "However, the good news is that Statista has also shared updated data on annual growth, so we can still report detailed insights into annual growth.", "At 17 percent, Fashion & Beauty posted the strongest growth over the past year, with annual global spend in the category now topping half a trillion US dollars.", "However, online travel and accommodation bookings accounted for the largest share of consumer e-commerce spending in 2018, with users around the world spending a combined US$750 billion on online travel over the course of the full year.", "The number of e-commerce users has also grown considerably since last year, with Statista reporting that more than 2.8 billion people around the world now shop online.", "These shoppers are spending more money too, with the latest global average revenue per user figures (ARPU) up by more than 10 percent year-on-year to reach US$634.", "E-commerce penetration is still quite varied around the world though, and there is still plenty of room for growth in some of the world’s biggest economies.", "GlobalWebIndex reports that 74 percent of Indian internet users say they have purchased something online in the past month, but with internet penetration in the country hovering just above 40 percent, there are still hundreds of millions of people across the country who have yet to join the e-commerce revolution.", "Digging a bit deeper into the e-commerce data, we’ve compared the latest ARPU figures to GDP per capita, making it easier to get a sense of how important e-commerce is across different countries.", "The standout story in this comparison is China, where people spend more than 7 percent of GDP per capita online.", "Meanwhile, data from Worldpay’s recent Global Payments Report allow us to look at e-commerce spend in the context of broader retail spend.", "We’ve combined the figures Worldpay have reported for both e-commerce and offline point-of-sale spends to create a proxy for ‘total retail spend’, which we can use to understand e-commerce’s overall share.", "As you might expect, the figures vary considerably from one country to another, but those individual numbers make for insightful reading.", "It’s particularly interesting to note that – despite the strength of e-commerce in China – the country isn’t even in the top 10 in this list.", "Just before I conclude with some key forecasts for the coming year, I thought you’d like to know that the full Digital 2019 suite includes individual reports for more than 230 countries and territories around the world.", "To whet your appetite for those local reports, here’s a summary of the key headlines for each geography in our dataset.", "Don’t forget to read on below for those forecasts, though.", "Hopefully that extensive (!) roundup of key data points has given you a thorough grasp of digital today, but let’s finish up by taking a look at the year ahead.", "But this isn’t a predictions piece; rather, it’s an extension of the trends that I’ve been seeing in this year’s data.", "1. Voice control will increase in importance: the next phase of internet growth will come almost entirely from developing markets.", "However, as you can see in the chart below, many of these countries suffer from lower levels of literacy compared to the countries that dominate the internet today.", "As a result, global platforms like Google, Facebook and Amazon will look for more user-friendly interfaces to serve these new users, and voice looks set to dominate these efforts, at least in the near term.", "For clarity though, this isn’t a story about the rise of smart speakers in Africa; rather, it’s about a complete and revolutionary change in the way people interact with connected content and devices.", "2. The social landscape will evolve: with some of the world’s top social platforms losing users over extended periods, it’s likely that we’ll see some attrition and consolidation in the social media industry over the coming months.", "If current downward trends continue, we can expect investors in both Twitter and Snapchat to increase pressure on those companies’ boards to accept an offer of acquisition.", "At the same time, it feels like ‘the next big innovation’ is already overdue. However, this isn’t about the move to the ‘stories’ format, much as that will inevitably be one of the biggest stories in social media in 2019.", "Rather, my sense is that privacy concerns, changes in people’s social media preferences and behaviours, and broader fatigue with existing platforms will all combine to inspire a series of new social platforms in 2019, perhaps making use of new innovations like Tim Berners-Lee’s SOLID.", "This would fundamentally change the very fabric of business on the internet though, so expect to see plenty of resistance from the ‘Four Horsemen’.", "3. Marketing as a service: looking behind the scenes of the brands that achieve the greatest success on the internet, it becomes apparent that many of them share something in common: they treat marketing as a service.", "Rather than pumping out endless corporate propaganda and trite advertising, these brands use their marketing budgets to create things of value for their audiences.", "Whether it’s something as simple as a valuable how-to video on YouTube, or a large scale event that puts the audience at the heart of the action, this ‘marketing as a service’ is the only antidote to ongoing media inflation and the audience shift from newsfeeds to stories.", "If you’d like to dig deeper into the full collection of Digital 2019 reports, you’ll find every one of them for free in our library here on DataReportal.com, together with all of our previous reports from the past 8 years.", "And if this ridiculously long post hasn’t put you off the idea of discussing these themes with me in more detail, please feel free to get in touch with me on LinkedIn or Twitter.", "That’s it for this year, though; I wish you all the best for your own year of impressive digital growth in 2019, and I look forward to seeing you again, same time, same place, next year."]}

James Simons of Renaissance Technologies and Ray Dalio of Bridgewater Associates each made more than $1 billion in 2016, even though, as Institutional Investor’s Alpha reported, the top-25 hedge-fund earners took in the least as a group since 2005, largely because of the industry’s overall poor investment performance.", "“Technology allows a hedge fund to be able to manage $20 billion and invest it,” says Steve Kaplan. “I don’t think people had the systems and information to do that 20 to 30 years ago.", "Now they have the systems and the information to do that. That technological change is here and is not going away.", "The question of what, if anything, should be done in response to the spectacular rise of the 0.01 percent is a thorny one, as Mankiw acknowledged.", "“At the outset, it is worth noting that addressing the issue of rising inequality necessarily involves not just economics but a healthy dose of political philosophy,” he wrote.", "When policy makers want to address the concentration of income and wealth, the first place some have looked is the top marginal tax rate, which slid in the US and other developed countries after the Reagan and Thatcher revolutions.", "The US and UK had tax rates as high as 80 percent, wrote Saez and Piketty in the Guardian in 2013. “The job of economists should be to make a top rate tax level of 80 percent at least ‘thinkable’ again.”", "But on this, Steve Kaplan disagrees. Raising the top marginal rate could send people and their money scurrying for tax havens, he says, pointing to France as an example.", "Raising the top tax rates in the US could also send people to take advantage of more favorable tax rules within the code itself.", "And closing perceived loopholes can be controversial. For example, some people working in finance benefit from the code’s treatment of carried interest, where income flowing to the general partner of an investment fund is typically treated as capital gains and therefore taxed at a lower rate.", "“This tax preference is viewed as an unfair, market-distorting loophole by some but consistent with the tax treatment of other entrepreneurial income by others,” writes the Tax Policy Center.", "Then there’s the issue of whether raising the top marginal rate could discourage business activity. The marginal rate is intended to tax individuals on their earnings, and it rises with income.", "But a lot of business income is being taxed at that marginal rate rather than a corporate rate. Because the top US marginal personal tax rate was lower than the corporate rate for some time, business owners had an incentive to change their form of corporate organization from the traditional C corporation, which has profits taxed at the higher, corporate rate, to a partnership, limited liability corporation, or S corporation, taxed at the lower, individual rate.", "By 2011, these pass-through entities accounted for most of the business income earned in the US. (For more, see “The $100 billion tax dodge,” Summer 2016.)", "Policy makers should design an income-tax system that takes into account the nature of the income, and design a system that harmonizes taxes to discourage people from shopping the code for the best tax rates, Zwick suggests—recognizing this is a tall order.", "And despite his research interest, Greg Kaplan says we should be careful about populist reactions that lead us to focus too much on the super-rich: “We are better off concentrating on how to improve the lives of those in the bottom 50 percent.”", "In this group, many workers are in desperate need of a skills upgrade. As these workers fall behind, many economists say, policy makers need to focus on better preparing them for the workforce, perhaps by investing in education, working more closely with local companies to determine what skills their workers need, and removing barriers such as onerous regulations preventing people from entering certain professions.", "(For more, see “How to create middle-class jobs,” Summer 2017.)", "In short, there’s a split among economists. Some argue that income needs to be distributed more equitably, while others say governments should focus less on taking actions that could inhibit top earners and more on addressing the reasons others aren’t as successful.", "Do we slow the 0.01 percent or lift the 99.99 percent, which could be a heavier and more complex assignment?", "As the debate continues, members of the 0.01 percent continue on their course.", "Stanford’s Marietje Schaake discusses the threats technology poses to democracy.", "Capitalisn’t: Can Democracy Coexist with Big Tech?Chicago Booth’s Matthew Notowidigdo discusses the high price tags many people face for medical care.", "Why Is US Healthcare So Expensive?Monetary policy decisions can have meaningful long-term effects.", "How High Interest Rates Harm InnovationYour Privacy", "We want to demonstrate our commitment to your privacy.

In Italy – one of the first Western countries to experience a complete lockdown – the number of group calls on Facebook Messenger involving three or more users increased by more than 1,000 percent in March alone, while people across the country have also increased the time they spend using Facebook-owned apps by more than 70 percent since the lockdown began.", "App Annie also reports that the amount of time people spend using Snapchat and TikTok has grown considerably over recent weeks, while Reddit has also reported increases of 20-50% in traffic to subreddits related to business, finance, news, education, travel, and sports.", "Social media platforms see solid growth in active users", "In addition to these increases in time spent, the latest data suggest that all of the key social platforms that we track in our ongoing Global Digital Reports grew their active user bases over the first three months of 2020 as well.", "Twitter saw the biggest quarterly jump amongst these platforms. Numbers published in the company’s self-service advertising tools show that advertisers can now reach 47 million more people on Twitter compared to January 2020, equating to a quarter-on-quarter increase of 14 percent.", "Interestingly, Russia accounted for roughly 30 percent of Twitter’s global growth this quarter. The company’s data show that the number of people in the country that advertisers can reach using Twitter ads increased by 149 percent over the past three months, from 9.5 million in January 2020, to more than 23.5 million by the start of April.", "Facebook’s advertising audience also grew in the first three months of 2020, and is up by almost 4 percent since January (more on this below).", "Instagram’s audience is growing even faster, registering an uplift of 4.5 percent since the start of the year, while Snapchat’s tools indicate that the platforms’ advertising audience grew by 4.2 percent during the same period.", "Sadly, TikTok remains tight-lipped on active user numbers, so we’re unable to provide any new insights that would enable us to compare the platform’s growth directly to other platforms.", "However, the latest data from App Annie show that TikTok still trails Instagram when it comes to monthly active users of each platform’s mobile app.", "In addition to their usual ‘portfolio’ of social apps, people have also been turning to new platforms and solutions to help with the unique challenges that the pandemic has created.", "In particular, video conferencing apps have quickly moved to the centre of many people’s work lives, and many users have been using these platforms to stay in touch with friends and family too.", "Despite lingering concerns about privacy, teleconferencing service Zoom has been a clear winner, with the company revealing that it’s had as many as 200 million daily active users in recent weeks – 20 times more than pre-pandemic levels.", "The latest reports from App Annie also reveal that Zoom was one of the ten most-downloaded apps around the world in March 2020, with the app generating a greater number of downloads than Netflix.", "Zoom isn’t the only video calling app that’s seen adoption accelerate in recent weeks though. App Annie reports that Google’s Meet app (until recently known as Hangouts Meet) saw 30 times as many downloads in the USA in the week of March 15th to 21st compared to pre-pandemic levels.", "Downloads of the app also increased dramatically in Europe, with Italy registering 140 times as many downloads, Spain 64 times as many, and the UK 24 times as many.", "Houseparty has been another big winner, especially amongst younger users who’ve been unable to meet up with friends during the lockdown.", "App Annie reports that downloads of the Houseparty app in Spain jumped by a factor of 2,360x in the week of March 15th to 21st.", "Italy saw an increase of 423x, while the UK, which started from a higher base of existing users, still saw downloads jump by 17x.", "It’s unclear to what extent these new behaviours will continue once lockdowns have been lifted and people are able to socialise in person again, but with many people now using these platforms multiple times each day, it’s likely that significant numbers of people have already overcome key barriers to trial and adoption.", "As a result, there’s a real likelihood that many of the social media habits that people have formed in recent weeks will outlast the pandemic, and a move to more ‘face-to-face’ digital interactions may be an important legacy of coronavirus lockdowns on the world’s social media behaviours.", "Advertisers can now reach more than 2 billion people on Facebook", "The latest numbers published in Facebook’s self-service advertising tools reveal that advertisers can now reach more than 2 billion people around the world on the company’s core platform – the first time we’ve seen audience numbers reach this milestone during our ongoing tracking.", "If we assume that all of these users are at least 13 years old – as required by the platform’s terms of service – these figures would mean that advertisers can now reach more than one-third of the world’s total population aged 13 and above using adverts on Facebook.", "Compared to the advertising audience numbers that we reported in our Digital 2020 Global Digital Overview report in January, an additional 76 million people saw adverts on Facebook in March 2020 compared to December 2019.", "Much of this growth was fuelled by strong gains in the platform’s two largest countries. Advertisers can now reach 280 million people on Facebook in India, up by 20 million since January this year.", "The platforms’ US audience also grew by 10 million over the past three months, reaching a total addressable audience of 190 million people.", "It’s not just the platform’s audience numbers that have grown either; as we’ll explore in more detail in the next sections, the platform’s users are clicking on a greater number of adverts too.", "However, the latest numbers also suggest that just 80 percent of Facebook’s active users saw an advert in the past 30 days, which means that the platform was unable to monetise roughly 500 million of its 2.5 billion monthly active users during that time.", "There may be many reasons for a disparity between advertising audience numbers and total monthly active users.", "One important consideration is the impact of American sanctions on countries such as Iran, Cuba, and Sudan, which prevents US companies from selling advertising in these locations.", "However, user behaviours may also play a role, especially if people bypass the platform’s main feed by only checking their notifications, or heading straight to Groups.", "Various reports over recent weeks have highlighted significant downward pressure on the cost of digital advertising as economies struggle.", "Both the Wall Street Journal and Digiday cite various sources who report that the cost of advertising impressions on Facebook, Instagram, and YouTube have all declined by 15 to 20 percent between February and March 2020.", "Meanwhile, an article in the New York Times suggests that drops may have been even more precipitous, with one source reporting a fall of between 35 and 50 percent in the cost of Facebook ad impressions.", "Facebook itself has already announced that its business will be adversely affected by the coronavirus pandemic too.", "In particular, the company advised investors that recent increases in user activity may not translate into equivalent increases in ad revenue, stating:", "“Facebook doesn’t monetize many of the services where we’re seeing increased engagement, and we’ve seen a weakening in our ads business in countries taking aggressive actions to reduce the spread of COVID-19.”", "Analysts Cowen & Co have offered their analysis on this “weakening”, forecasting Facebook ad revenue for 2020 to be US$68 billion – almost US$16 billion (19 percent) lower than their previous forecast.", "They offered similarly pessimistic changes to their forecasts for Google’s performance too, predicting that the company’s net revenues in 2020 will be US$127.5 billion – 18 percent lower than their previous estimate.", "Facebook’s ad planning tools indicate that users have been clicking on more adverts on the platform in recent weeks compared to the end of 2019, both relatively and absolutely.", "The platform’s latest data show that the typical global Facebook user clicked on a median of 13 adverts in March 2020, up from December 2019’s median of 12.", "While that may not sound like much of an increase, our analysis of country-level data suggests that this may have translated into more than 3.5 billion additional clicks on Facebook ads in March 2020 compared to December 2019 activity.", "Furthermore, because this calculation is based on medians (as opposed to averages), the actual increase may be even higher.", "Overall, women are significantly more likely to click or tap on Facebook adverts compared to men, while people between the ages of 35 and 65 also show greater propensity to engage with commercial messages on the platform.", "Younger users are the least likely to interact with ads, with Facebook’s own data showing that users aged 18 to 24 click or tap on a median of just 10 adverts per month, compared to an overall median of 13 ad clicks per month across the platform’s total user base.", "However, the latest data suggest that – across all age groups – ad engagement has increased in recent weeks, potentially because people have been spending longer using social media.", "Data published in Facebook’s ad planning tools show that the median number of monthly ad clicks has increased in 194 countries out of 219 countries we’ve been able to analyse.", "Furthermore, the latest data from Locowise show that overall engagement levels for posts made by Pages on Facebook have increased over the past three months, although this is not true of all post format types.", "Critically, photo and video posts – formats that are particularly popular for paid media campaigns on Facebook – have seen average engagement rates increase by at least 1 percent over the past three months.", "So, while most marketers are likely battling with downward pressure on their ad budgets as a result of ongoing economic woes, the good news is that the cost of digital advertising appears to have gone down, while the likelihood that audiences will engage with those adverts has simultaneously gone up.", "These trends suggest that – if you’re able to secure budget – the current opportunities offered by digital advertising may be particularly compelling, especially compared to pre-pandemic performance.", "But should brands even be thinking about advertising at this time?", "Research from GlobalWebIndex shows that more than half of internet users (51 percent) approve of brands continuing to advertise as normal despite the Coronavirus outbreak, compared to less than one in five (18 percent) who say they disapprove.", "Just under a third (31 percent) say they neither approve nor disapprove.", "These findings are supported by research from Kantar, which found that only 8 percent of people believe that companies should stop advertising, compared to 64 percent of respondents who said they think it’s acceptable for brands to continue with commercial messaging.", "GlobalWebIndex’s data suggests that men have a more favourable attitude towards companies continuing to advertise as normal, but men and women in older age groups are more likely to disapprove.", "Perceptions also vary considerably by country, although it’s interesting to note that respondents in Italy and Spain – two countries that have been particularly hard-hit by the current crisis – appear to be more supportive of brands continuing to advertise.", "However, brands need to be careful how they approach advertising during the crisis, and research from Edelman found that one in three consumers have already “punished” brands that they perceived to have responded badly.", "Above all, brands need to demonstrate empathy, compassion, and sensitivity. This is a time to think about how your company and its products can genuinely help others in their time of need.", "The emphasis should be solving problems, not selling products.", "This could be about producing products and services that actively help to address current issues, such as Burberry making personal protective equipment for frontline medical practitioners, or LVMH converting its fragrance factories to produce hand sanitiser for French hospitals.", "However, something as simple as creating content that helps everyday people to achieve their own objectives can also add meaningful value.", "Indeed, GlobalWebIndex finds that tutorials and how-to videos are amongst the top kinds of content that consumers want more of during the COVID-19 crisis, and these may represent a particularly compelling opportunity for B2B brands.", "However, brands should be very careful when it comes to the use of humour. While GlobalWebIndex finds that people are craving more ‘funny’ content, this finding likely focuses on dedicated entertainment formats such as TV shows, and Edelman finds that 57 percent of consumers think brands should stop marketing activities that might be considered as “humorous or too lighthearted in tone” while the pandemic continues.", "Paid media don’t represent the only opportunities for brands, however, and the latest data offer a selection of good news for marketers who have seen budgets slashed in recent weeks.", "For starters, new numbers from Locowise show that organic reach on Facebook has actually increased over the past 3 months – the first time we’ve seen this metric improve in the time that we’ve been tracking it.", "The increase was admittedly quite modest (just 0.5 percent), but – as the saying goes – every little helps.", "Facebook’s own data also suggests that people have been more active on its core platform in recent weeks.", "One of the key changes has come in Page Likes, which have remained stubbornly low for most users since the platform’s inception.", "For context, Facebook’s self-service advertising tools have long reported that the typical user around the world has only ever ‘Liked’ one page on Facebook.", "As you might expect, this median varies from country to country, but no country registers more than 3 median Page Likes per users, and just 10 countries around the world have reached this level", "[for reference, these countries include Botswana, Tunisia, and Mongolia; you can find the full local story in our individual country reports].", "However, data published in these tools over recent weeks have shown a sudden increase in the number of countries in which users have liked a median of 2 or more pages – up from 41 countries in January, to 91 countries today.", "It’s unclear from the data which kinds of pages have benefited from this increase, but there is a chance that at least some of these pages will be related to the coronavirus pandemic, rather than being brand pages.", "Interestingly though, the number of post likes appears to have fallen during the same period, down from a median of 13 post likes per month in December 2019, to a median of 12 per month in March 2020.", "The picture varies by age and gender though, with women in their 30s and 40s more likely to click ‘like’ compared to users in other groups.", "But – in contrast to declining post likes – commenting activity appears to have increased over recent weeks, with Facebook’s tools reporting that the typical global user made a median of 6 comments during March 2020, compared to a median of 5 in December 2019.", "Once again, the level of comments varies meaningfully by age and gender, and women between the ages of 35 and 64 are considerably more likely to post a comment than users in any other demographic group.", "And while we’re on the subject of organic content, it’s worth noting that email marketing also appears to be enjoying improved performance in recent weeks.", "Data from BounceX shows that global email open rates have increased by roughly 30 percent since the start of March, while email click rates have also seen increases of between 5 and 10 percent (albeit with meaningful daily fluctuations).", "Marketing mix considerations: social platform overlaps", "Updates to platform user numbers seem to be a constant source of anxiety for marketers, who worry that they need to jump on every new platform in order to remain relevant.", "Admittedly, new platforms can offer a wealth of new opportunities, from exciting content formats, to reduced cost per impression, or even a ‘halo effect’ of being the first to try something new.", "However, if reach is one of your key considerations, the chart below should help you to make some more informed decisions when it comes to your channel mix, by helping you to identify what proportion of each social media platform’s users are ‘unique’.", "First, a bit of guidance on how to read the chart.

The latest data from Ookla shows that many countries saw meaningful drops in average download speeds for both mobile and fixed internet connections between February and March 2020.", "However, most countries still registered year-on-year increases in average connection speeds, so it’s likely that these month-on-month drops are a direct result of the increased network demands of people’s lockdown-specific behaviours.", "For example, the sudden increase in video streaming – both for video conferencing apps like Zoom, and content streaming services like Netflix – will have resulted in a significant increase in demand for bandwidth, and given the unexpected nature of these increases, it’s little surprise that networks have been affected.", "However, some of the larger streaming platforms have taken active measures to reduce the load that their services impose on networks, with Netflix being one of the first to publicly announce temporary reductions in streaming rates in order to reduce bandwidth demands.", "The latest data from Ericsson show that the world’s mobile users already consumed almost 40 billion gigabytes of mobile data every month during Q4 2019, but all the evidence suggests that this figure will jump considerably in Q1 2020.", "However – despite a slew of lurid headlines – it doesn’t appear that adult content has contributed to increased bandwidth consumption, at least at a global level.", "The latest data from SimilarWeb suggest that there hasn’t been a significant change in traffic to the world’s most popular adult content websites in recent weeks, nor have visitors been spending any longer on these sites than they did prior to coronavirus lockdowns.", "Nearly half of the internet users surveyed by GlobalWebIndex at the start of April said that they’ve been spending more time shopping online in recent weeks, but there are some interesting differences between the behaviours of different genders and age groups.", "More than half of internet users aged 25 to 44 in the 17 countries covered in the survey say they have been spending more time shopping online in recent weeks, with men in particular saying that they’ve increased the amount of time they’re spending on ecommerce activities.", "At a country level, China has seen the greatest increase in the amount of time that people have been spending shopping online, which is all the more impressive when we consider that China already has some of the highest rates of ecommerce adoption in the world.", "The Food & Grocery category has seen the greatest increases in ecommerce interest, with GlobalWebIndex finding that a third of internet users have been shopping more for these items online as a result of their country’s COVID-19 lockdowns.", "This has translated into a significant increase in traffic to supermarket websites too. ContentSquare reported a 251 percent increase in visits to supermarket websites in the seven days from April 8th to April 15th, compared to average weekly traffic at the start of 2020.", "The company also reported a 76 percent rise in transactions on supermarket websites during the same period, compared to pre-lockdown levels.", "These findings are echoed by Alexa’s latest ranking of the world’s top websites, which shows that ecommerce websites currently account for 6 out of the top 20 places.", "Interestingly, 5 of these are Chinese ecommerce sites, with Alibaba’s Tmall accounting for two distinct domains in the top 10.", "While this is perhaps unsurprising given the extent of China’s coronavirus lockdown, it suggests that the shift in the internet’s centre of gravity that we covered in our October 2019 and January 2020 reports continues, and that trend may even be accelerating.", "Sadly, a very different story has been unfolding in the travel category. ContentSquare reports that traffic to tourism-related websites is down by 72 percent in recent weeks compared to pre-COVID levels.", "Worse still, the company reports that transactions on tourism-related websites have almost completely dried up, registering a 92 percent drop in the week to April 15th compared to the weekly average at the start of 2020.", "However, despite these grim statistics, GlobalWebIndex’s research offers a small ray of hope: some people have been using their lockdown time to explore and plan vacations – albeit ones to take in the future.", "As a result, travel marketers who have any remaining marketing budget may want to shift their focus from the usual short-term focus of direct-response advertising, to activities designed for longer-term inspiration and branding.", "Key considerations here will be platforms like Instagram and Pinterest, which travellers often turn to when they’re in the ‘dreaming’ phase of planning.", "A return to normality may still seem like a dream for travel brands, but where resources permit, now is an ideal time to start planting seeds for the future.", "It will also be interesting to see how many of these ecommerce trends will continue in the post-COVID world.", "While it’s almost certain that people will return to physical stores once the current phase of lockdowns comes to an end, there’s also a good chance that some of our new behaviours will endure.", "In particular, in countries that experience lockdowns lasting longer than a month, there’s a real chance that new behaviours will start to become actual habits.", "Research suggests that it takes roughly two months for a new behaviour to become an ‘automatic’ habit, although the frequency of action is also an important consideration.", "As a result, regular activities such as grocery shopping are more likely to see enduring changes in behaviour, compared to categories that have enjoyed a spike in one-off purchases over recent weeks.", "Consumers also seem open to continuing with some of their new habits.

offline shopping once the lockdown had been lifted.", "Perhaps unsurprisingly, Google has seen a huge increase in coronavirus-related searches in recent weeks.", "“Coronavirus” was the third most frequently entered search query across the whole of Q1, but the query topped the rankings in March, generating more than twice as many searches as the perennial top term, “Google.”", "[For context, “Google” is usually the top search query because people type the word into the address bar of their browser, but then fail to complete the URL with the subsequent “.com”, so when they hit enter, Google treats the word as a search term instead of as a web address].", "Meanwhile, searches for “corona” placed third in March’s top search rankings – ahead of Facebook – while a total of four coronavirus-related queries appeared in the top 20.", "The ranking of queries by their month-on-month increases in search volume is even more telling, with 16 of the top 20 ‘rising’ terms in March 2020 directly related to coronavirus, and another three closely linked to the pandemic and its consequences.", "The only term in Google’s ‘rising’ list for March that is not associated with the COVID-19 outbreak is “hantavirus”.", "It seems that searches for this query surged in recent weeks after a man in China died after being infected with the virus, but – despite an ensuing social media panic – guidance from America’s CDC suggests that the disease is likely to remain rare amongst humans.", "The trends we’ve identified in this quarter’s report have clearly been dominated by changes in behaviour that can be directly attributed to the coronavirus pandemic.", "However, there are some other stories we’ve been tracking that – under other circumstances – would have gained a lot more of

internet populations in the world, accounting for more than 40 percent of total global users.", "Despite a persistent myth that Millennials and Gen Z don’t use email, the latest data from GlobalWebIndex shows that email use remains consistently high across all age groups.", "Critically, roughly three-quarters of internet users between the ages of 16 and 24 say they used a webmail service to read or send emails in the past month.", "Concerns about misuse of data continue to rise around the world. 65 percent of internet users between the ages of 16 and 64 surveyed by GlobalWebIndex say they worry about how companies use their personal data, up from the 64 percent figure that we reported in January.", "Younger users are the biggest users of ad-blocking tools,

steps.", "However, here are some of the things I’d expect to see:", "- Use of video calling and teleconferencing services is likely to remain at higher levels than those we saw before the pandemic, even once lockdowns have been lifted.", "In particular, now that many companies have overcome the initial barriers to trial and implementation of these tools, it’s reasonable to expect that they will become a more integrated part of ongoing work routines, especially for replacing phone-based “conference calls”.", "However, I suspect that the novelty of ‘online socialising’ may wane once people are able to socialise in the ‘real world’ again, especially during the initial phases of the recovery as people make the most of being able to leave their homes.", "- With many people relying more heavily on online grocery shopping in recent weeks, I’d expect to see this new behaviour persist at higher levels than those we saw before COVID-19 lockdowns, albeit as part of a combination of online and offline shopping.", "This will have particular relevance for brands in the fresh produce category, which has seen some of the greatest increases in ecommerce relevance over recent weeks.", "- As companies continue to battle with the economic impact of lockdowns, advertising budgets may take many months to return to pre-pandemic levels.", "As a result, brands and their agency partners will need to experiment with more cost-efficient activities, with particular emphasis on organic distribution, as well as advertising channels and formats that can deliver more tangible returns to a brand’s bottom line.", "Creativity will also play a particularly important role, especially as the global mood fluctuates during recoveries and potential recurrences of the outbreak.", "- If conventional sports and sporting events continue to be suspended beyond the middle of the year, esports may attract increased interest from both sponsors and gambling companies.", "While it’s unlikely that esports will ever replace more ‘physical’ sports, brands that experiment with esports-related activities now will likely be better placed should that opportunity endure.", "Amongst all the other growth trends we’ve been tracking over the past few weeks, there’s one that we can’t seem to escape.", "Specifically, an unprecedented increase in journalists’ use of the word “unprecedented” has led to unprecedented growth in the number of people searching for the word “unprecedented.”"]}

However, this is something that robust branded content and inspiration can change.”", "The key takeaway here is that there is no silver bullet when it comes to “closing a sale”, and marketers would do well to consider the full scope of the consumer purchase cycle – from initial discovery through to purchase, and even post-purchase activities – when devising their plans.", "Moreover, marketers would do well to stop thinking in terms of ‘online’ and ‘offline’. With most shoppers demonstrating that they’re equally happy to engage with connected devices and physical-world properties in equal measure – often simultaneously – it’s increasingly clear that these ‘lines’ only exist in marketers’ heads and budgets.", "Every year when we’re producing these reports, we spot something fun in the data.

feelings may lead to a sense of self-inferiority and depression over time.[45]", "It is also possible that the feeling of “time wasted” by engaging in activities of little meaning on social media

of “Internet addiction” as a distinct psychiatric condition that is closely associated with depression.[46,47] Finally, it is possible that increased social media exposure may increase the risk of cyber-bullying, which may also increase feelings of depression.[48,49]", "Regardless of the direction of association between social media use and depression, these findings should be of interest to clinicians and public health practitioners.", "For example, it may be valuable for clinicians to assess social media use among depressed individuals to probe for maladaptive patterns of use, which may be contributing to mood dysregulation.", "Additionally, there may be useful ways of leveraging social media to decrease stigma of depression and identify individuals at risk, such as detecting self-disclosures of depression on social media.[50] Because social media has become an integrated component of human interaction, it is important for clinicians interacting with young adults to recognize the important balance to be struck in encouraging potential positive use but redirecting from problematic use.", "With regard to public health practitioners, these findings suggest that social media may provide valuable venues to screen for depression or to disseminate targeted educational messages regarding depression.", "Such messages could promote awareness regarding maladaptive use and its association with mood disorders.", "The teams behind some social media sites have already begun to reach out to users who show signs of serious depression.", "When one searches blog site Tumblr for tags indicative of a mental health crisis such as “depressed,” “suicidal,” or “hopeless,” the search function redirects to a message which begins with “Everything okay?” and provides links to pertinent resources.[51] Similarly, in early 2015, Facebook tested a feature by which users’ friends could easily and anonymously report worrisome posts.[52] Authors of problematic content received pop-up messages on their next visit to the site voicing concern and encouraging them to speak with a friend or helpline worker.", "Although this button has since been removed, Facebook still accepts reports of suicidal content via an online form.", "Continued research into the factors that relate SM and depression will allow sites to refine their procedures and reach out to those with greatest need.", "It is important to note that there are many different types of interactions that can occur over social media, and our study assessed only overall time spent and frequency of visits to social media sites.", "Moreover, because previous work in this area has tended to focus on one specific platform, most commonly Facebook, we aimed to look at the relationship between total social media use and depression,[16,21] as opposed to focusing on specific platforms.", "Our fine-grained assessment of multiple platforms likely improved our measurement of overall frequency of social media use.", "However, given the unique features of each platform, it may be valuable for future work to assess associations between specific social media sites and depression.", "Furthermore, it will be an important task of future qualitative and quantitative research to comprehensively assess content and contextual elements related to social media use.", "For example, time on social media may be primarily spent viewing profiles, or it may be spent as an active participant, and these distinct patterns of use may have differential associations with mood conditions.", "Thus, it may be that those who are more active users feel more engaged and derive more sense of social capital from social media interactions.[19,53]", "However, it may also be that active users are more prone to having negative exposures, which can affect self-cognitions.", "Therefore, active vs. passive character of social media interaction and its effect on mood may be valuable to assess in the future.", "Additionally, it will be important to assess the overall emotional valence of social media interactions.", "Some individuals may primarily spend time “liking” others’ posts, wishing friends happy birthday, and making positive comments.", "Others, however, may be prone to posting negative status updates or engaging in contentious interactions, which may be detrimental to relationship-building and lead to depression.[54]", "Given the rapid proliferation of social media platforms, we attempted to capture broad and representative use of social media by young adults by including multiple social media platforms and creating three complementary methods of assessing social media use based on self-report.", "However, it was a limitation of our work that we were unable to use “gold standard” measures of social media exposure such as ecological momentary assessment or empirical data from social media sites due to the large sample size.", "Additionally, our frequency measure, although it was adapted from a validated scale,[14] may not have been sufficient for modern users.", "In particular, the highest exposure level we assessed for each platform was “5 or more times per day,” while other scales include options such as use “several times an hour” and “all the time.", "”[55] It may be valuable for future studies to use more fine-grained measures such as these. It is also a limitation that we were unable to conduct a complete diagnostic interview to determine if participants met clinical diagnosis of depression.", "Further longitudinal studies involving ecological momentary assessment or empirical data from multiple social media platforms may help identify the directionality of the association between social media and depression and guide anticipatory guidance around social media use for patients with depression in particular.", "In conclusion, this study assessed depression and social media use across multiple social media platforms in a large, nationally representative sample of young adults.", "Given the increasing prevalence of social media and the substantial morbidity and mortality associated with depression worldwide, the positive association we found between social media use and depression has important implications for future research and intervention.", "For example, longitudinal evaluation and finer-grained assessment of content and contextual factors will ultimately improve our understanding of these associations and our ability to intervene.", "Additionally, social media platforms may be a useful tool to identify individuals at risk for depression and to provide intervention.", "Funding and Role of Sponsors: Liu yi Lin is supported by a grant from the National Institute of Mental Health (R25-MH054318).", "Dr. Primack is supported by a grant from the National Cancer Institute (R01-CA140150).

The percentages in the table identify the share of users of each platform in the left-hand column that are also users of each platform in the top row.", "For example, 35 percent of Instagram users also use Snapchat, while 86 percent of Snapchat users also use Instagram", "[note that this disparity is partly due to the fact that Instagram has roughly 3 times as many total users as Snapchat].", "But what does this great data from GlobalWebIndex actually tell us?", "The key takeaway is that very few social media users are ‘unique’ to just one platform. Being the largest platforms, Facebook and YouTube have the largest unique audiences, but even these platforms’ unique audiences only represent 6 percent and 7 percent (respectively) of their total user bases.", "More importantly, just 1 percent of the users of TikTok and Snapchat say they don’t use any other social platforms.", "Critically, this means that marketers can reach 99 percent of these platforms’ users via other social channels.", "Reach isn’t the only consideration when it comes to channel choices of course, but if big headlines about growing user bases have made you question whether you’ve adopted the right channel mix, these figures should help to allay many of your fears.", "My advice: fewer, bigger, better is still the simplest path to success when it comes to a social platform portfolio.", "Trying to manage presences on multiple platforms will likely stretch your resources, and you’ll quickly reach diminishing returns – especially if you’re not creating unique content for each platform.", "Video games have been a popular choice amongst people confined to their homes during the coronavirus pandemic.", "Data from GlobalWebIndex shows that – even before the current wave of lockdowns – 4 in 5 of the world’s internet users already played video games.", "However, new data from App Annie shows that weekly downloads of mobile games in March 2020 jumped by 30 percent compared to weekly averages for the final quarter of 2019, with people around the world downloading more than a billion games each week.", "In total, mobile users downloaded more than 13 billion games during the first three months of this year, and spent close to US$17 billion dollars on mobile games and in-game purchases during the same period – a 5 percent increase on spends in the last three months of 2019.", "GlobalWebIndex also finds that more than a third of internet users between the ages of 16 and 64 have been spending more time playing video games in recent weeks.", "This trend is particularly evident amongst younger users, with 43 percent of male internet users aged 16 to 24 saying they’re spending more time gaming.", "These evolving behaviours are visible in other kinds of data too. AT&T reports that gaming-related traffic in April 2020 was 50 percent higher than pre-lockdown levels.", "We’re not just spending more time playing games either; GlobalWebIndex’s research also finds that 10 percent of internet users around the world have been spending more time watching esports.", "Critically, however, this figure rises to more than 20 percent for internet users in India, which could point to a huge opportunity in one of the world’s biggest internet markets if this increased interest in esports continues in a post-lockdown world.", "The latest data from GlobalWebIndex show that mobile’s share of total internet time increased again in Q4 2019, and mobile devices now account for more than 51 percent of our connected lives.", "However, this data was collected prior to the current coronavirus outbreak, and the company’s more recent (unpublished) data indicate that people’s habits under lockdown will serve to extend mobile’s lead even further.", "This finding is supported by data from App Annie, which shows that the amount of time people spent using mobile devices during the first three months of 2020 increased by 20 percent compared to the same period last year.", "The company also reports that in China – the first country to impose a mass lockdown to contain the spread of coronavirus – mobile users spent an average of 5 hours per day using apps across the first three months of 2020, representing an increase of 30 percent compared to the levels seen at the start of 2019.", "Italy saw a similar pattern, with users spending more than 10 percent more time in apps across the whole of the first quarter.", "Meanwhile, data from Statcounter shows that mobile devices accounted for a greater share of global web traffic in March 2020 compared to the same time last year.", "The company’s latest data reveal that 52 percent of web page requests in March 2020 originated from mobile devices, representing a relative increase of more than 6 percent compared to the 48.9 percent that the company reported in March 2019.", "Computers’ share of web traffic dropped from 47 percent in March 2019 to 45.3 percent in March 2020, representing a relative drop of almost 4 percent, while tablets’ share of total traffic dropped by a third, from 4 percent in March 2019 to 2.7 percent in March 2020.", "These latest global figures are comparable with each device’s relative share throughout the second half of 2019 though, and early lockdown measures don’t appear to have had a dramatic impact on device preferences when it comes to the world’s web browsing activities.", "However, this may be because many countries only started lockdowns towards the end of March, so there’s a chance that the data for April will tell a different story.", "For example, Spain and South Korea – which both started lockdowns earlier in March – have seen a significant uptick in web traffic from laptops and desktops over recent weeks.", "Another interesting trend in mobile has been a marked increase in web traffic associated with iPhone devices.", "Data from Statcounter show that handsets powered by Apple’s iOS have steadily been gaining web traffic share over the past 6 months, up from 22 percent in October 2019, to 27 percent in March 2020.", "During the same period, the traffic shares attributable to handsets running operating systems other than Android or iOS have fallen considerably, highlighting the ongoing consolidation in the industry.", "However, it’s worth noting that people have also been spending more time using laptops and desktops as they find ways of dealing with life under lockdown, and people haven’t suddenly abandoned their computers.", "My sense is that we’ll also see device shares return to levels similar to those we saw before the pandemic once people are able to return to something resembling normal life.", "COVID-19 lockdowns have also had a clear impact on internet connection speeds. The latest data from Ookla shows that many countries saw meaningful drops in average download speeds for both mobile and fixed internet connections between February and March 2020.", "However, most countries still registered year-on-year increases in average connection speeds, so it’s likely that these month-on-month drops are a direct result of the increased network demands of people’s lockdown-specific behaviours.", "For example, the sudden increase in video streaming – both for video conferencing apps like Zoom, and content streaming services like Netflix – will have resulted in a significant increase in demand for bandwidth, and given the unexpected nature of these increases, it’s little surprise that networks have been affected.", "However, some of the larger streaming platforms have taken active measures to reduce the load that their services impose on networks, with Netflix being one of the first to publicly announce temporary reductions in streaming rates in order to reduce bandwidth demands.", "The latest data from Ericsson show that the world’s mobile users already consumed almost 40 billion gigabytes of mobile data every month during Q4 2019, but all the evidence suggests that this figure will jump considerably in Q1 2020.", "However – despite a slew of lurid headlines – it doesn’t appear that adult content has contributed to increased bandwidth consumption, at least at a global level.", "The latest data from SimilarWeb suggest that there hasn’t been a significant change in traffic to the world’s most popular adult content websites in recent weeks, nor have visitors been spending any longer on these sites than they did prior to coronavirus lockdowns.", "Nearly half of the internet users surveyed by GlobalWebIndex at the start of April said that they’ve been spending more time shopping online in recent weeks, but there are some interesting differences between the behaviours of different genders and age groups.", "More than half of internet users aged 25 to 44 in the 17 countries covered in the survey say they have been spending more time shopping online in recent weeks, with men in particular saying that they’ve increased the amount of time they’re spending on ecommerce activities.", "At a country level, China has seen the greatest increase in the amount of time that people have been spending shopping online, which is all the more impressive when we consider that China already has some of the highest rates of ecommerce adoption in the world.", "The Food & Grocery category has seen the greatest increases in ecommerce interest, with GlobalWebIndex finding that a third of internet users have been shopping more for these items online as a result of their country’s COVID-19 lockdowns.", "This has translated into a significant increase in traffic to supermarket websites too. ContentSquare reported a 251 percent increase in visits to supermarket websites in the seven days from April 8th to April 15th, compared to average weekly traffic at the start of 2020.", "The company also reported a 76 percent rise in transactions on supermarket websites during the same period, compared to pre-lockdown levels.", "These findings are echoed by Alexa’s latest ranking of the world’s top websites, which shows that ecommerce websites currently account for 6 out of the top 20 places.", "Interestingly, 5 of these are Chinese ecommerce sites, with Alibaba’s Tmall accounting for two distinct domains in the top 10.", "While this is perhaps unsurprising given the extent of China’s coronavirus lockdown, it suggests that the shift in the internet’s centre of gravity that we covered in our October 2019 and January 2020 reports continues, and that trend may even be accelerating.", "Sadly, a very different story has been unfolding in the travel category. ContentSquare reports that traffic to tourism-related websites is down by 72 percent in recent weeks compared to pre-COVID levels.", "Worse still, the company reports that transactions on tourism-related websites have almost completely dried up, registering a 92 percent drop in the week to April 15th compared to the weekly average at the start of 2020.", "However, despite these grim statistics, GlobalWebIndex’s research offers a small ray of hope: some people have been using their lockdown time to explore and plan vacations – albeit ones to take in the future.", "As a result, travel marketers who have any remaining marketing budget may want to shift their focus from the usual short-term focus of direct-response advertising, to activities designed for longer-term inspiration and branding.", "Key considerations here will be platforms like Instagram and Pinterest, which travellers often turn to when they’re in the ‘dreaming’ phase of planning.", "A return to normality may still seem like a dream for travel brands, but where resources permit, now is an ideal time to start planting seeds for the future.", "It will also be interesting to see how many of these ecommerce trends will continue in the post-COVID world.", "While it’s almost certain that people will return to physical stores once the current phase of lockdowns comes to an end, there’s also a good chance that some of our new behaviours will endure.", "In particular, in countries that experience lockdowns lasting longer than a month, there’s a real chance that new behaviours will start to become actual habits.", "Research suggests that it takes roughly two months for a new behaviour to become an ‘automatic’ habit, although the frequency of action is also an important consideration.", "As a result, regular activities such as grocery shopping are more likely to see enduring changes in behaviour, compared to categories that have enjoyed a spike in one-off purchases over recent weeks.", "Consumers also seem open to continuing with some of their new habits. Research from Kantar found that 42 percent of people in China who started shopping online for the first time during the country’s recent lockdown expected to continue with a combination of online and offline shopping once the lockdown had been lifted.", "Perhaps unsurprisingly, Google has seen a huge increase in coronavirus-related searches in recent weeks.", "“Coronavirus” was the third most frequently entered search query across the whole of Q1, but the query topped the rankings in March, generating more than twice as many searches as the perennial top term, “Google.”", "[For context, “Google” is usually the top search query because people type the word into the address bar of their browser, but then fail to complete the URL with the subsequent “.com”, so when they hit enter, Google treats the word as a search term instead of as a web address].", "Meanwhile, searches for “corona” placed third in March’s top search rankings – ahead of Facebook – while a total of four coronavirus-related queries appeared in the top 20.", "The ranking of queries by their month-on-month increases in search volume is even more telling, with 16 of the top 20 ‘rising’ terms in March 2020 directly related to coronavirus, and another three closely linked to the pandemic and its consequences.", "The only term in Google’s ‘rising’ list for March that is not associated with the COVID-19 outbreak is “hantavirus”.", "It seems that searches for this query surged in recent weeks after a man in China died after being infected with the virus, but – despite an ensuing social media panic – guidance from America’s CDC suggests that the disease is likely to remain rare amongst humans.", "The trends we’ve identified in this quarter’s report have clearly been dominated by changes in behaviour that can be directly attributed to the coronavirus pandemic.", "However, there are some other stories we’ve been tracking that – under other circumstances – would have gained a lot more of our attention.", "I’m guessing you’re probably suffering from a bit of data overload by now though, so I’ve distilled these stories down into the essential headlines.", "The use of voice interfaces continues to grow, especially on mobile devices. 45 percent of internet users now say they use voice search and voice commands each month, compared to the 43 percent that we reported in January.", "Furthermore, voice interface use now extends to more than half of internet users in India, China, Indonesia, Mexico, and Turkey.", "For context, these five countries represent some of the largest internet populations in the world, accounting for more than 40 percent of total global users.", "Despite a persistent myth that Millennials and Gen Z don’t use email, the latest data from GlobalWebIndex shows that email use remains consistently high across all age groups.", "Critically, roughly three-quarters of internet users between the ages of 16 and 24 say they used a webmail service to read or send emails in the past month.", "Concerns about misuse of data continue to rise around the world. 65 percent of internet users between the ages of 16 and 64 surveyed by GlobalWebIndex say they worry about how companies use their personal data, up from the 64 percent figure that we reported in January.", "Younger users are the biggest users of ad-blocking tools, although men are considerably more likely to use these tools than women.", "No one knows how long the COVID-19 pandemic will continue to affect our lives, so it’s difficult to offer advice on next steps.", "However, here are some of the things I’d expect to see:", "Use of video calling and teleconferencing services is likely to remain at higher levels than those we saw before the pandemic, even once lockdowns have been lifted.", "In particular, now that many companies have overcome the initial barriers to trial and implementation of these tools, it’s reasonable to expect that they will become a more integrated part of ongoing work routines, especially for replacing phone-based “conference calls”.", "However, I suspect that the novelty of ‘online socialising’ may wane once people are able to socialise in the ‘real world’ again, especially during the initial phases of the recovery as people make the most of being able to leave their homes.", "With many people relying more heavily on online grocery shopping in recent weeks, I’d expect to see this new behaviour persist at higher levels than those we saw before COVID-19 lockdowns, albeit as part of a combination of online and offline shopping.", "This will have particular relevance for brands in the fresh produce category, which has seen some of the greatest increases in ecommerce relevance over recent weeks.", "As companies continue to battle with the economic impact of lockdowns, advertising budgets may take many months to return to pre-pandemic levels.", "As a result, brands and their agency partners will need to experiment with more cost-efficient activities, with particular emphasis on organic distribution, as well as advertising channels and formats that can deliver more tangible returns to a brand’s bottom line.", "Creativity will also play a particularly important role, especially as the global mood fluctuates during recoveries and potential recurrences of the outbreak.", "If conventional sports and sporting events continue to be suspended beyond the middle of the year, esports may attract increased interest from both sponsors and gambling companies.", "While it’s unlikely that esports will ever replace more ‘physical’ sports, brands that experiment with esports-related activities now will likely be better placed should that opportunity endure.", "Amongst all the other growth trends we’ve been tracking over the past few weeks, there’s one that we can’t seem to escape.", "Specifically, an unprecedented increase in journalists’ use of the word “unprecedented” has led to unprecedented growth in the number of people searching for the word “unprecedented.”"]}

But soon, even that wasn’t enough.", "So in mid-2020, after mostly self-funding and taking in a bit from friends and family, Jared started looking for outside funding, and ultimately raised $200,000 Maryland’s TEDCO Seed Fund.", "The interesting thing about this fundraise, Jared told me, was that it came without a stated valuation - the $200K was awarded as a promissory note (a P Note), which is “a debt instrument that converts to equity in the company that issues it when certain conditions outlined in the promissory note are met.”", "In this case, those conditions were a subsequent fundraise within 18 months of receiving the $200K. I guess that’s why they say that startup fundraising is very much a hamster wheel.", "So what’s Jared going to use this first $200K for?", "“My technology was very difficult to execute,” Jared told me, “I couldn’t just build an MVP website and let it loose.”", "Indeed, Jared explained that YoTengo’s AI engine requires a lot of high-level engineering which, unfortunately, doesn’t come cheap.", "Aside from engineering, Jared shared that “it's also really about getting to the next level of sales.", "For me, it's about trying to get to 75, to 100 customers with this money.”", "If you want to learn more about YoTengo, or see if it can help out your immigration firm, check out their website or connect with Jared Jaskot directly.", "Also, if you want to hear Jared’s story, check out our conversation on my podcast.", "Nonprofit immigration tech startup ImmigrationHelp.

Elena told me that they’re also backed by 2 business advisers with deep marketplace know-how: Stefan Haney, a former Amazon exec who helped build Amazon’s marketplace, and Florin Filote, who built a large online marketplace in Eastern Europe.", "It’s incredibly exciting to see this much action in the immigration technology space, and not just in the US or Canada, but truly across the world.", "As the founder and CEO of an immigration tech company myself, I’d be remiss if I didn’t share a small update about where my company, LaborLess, is and what we’ve experienced over the course of 2020 as well.", "2020 was a boom year for electronic LCA posting and public access files management, too.", "2020 has been the huge year for LaborLess, our biggest yet.

In March 2018, the FTC challenged the merger of CDK Global and Auto/Mate, alleging that Auto/Mate was an innovative firm whose future competitive significance was belied by its small presence in the market.", "The companies abandoned the merger rather than litigate. In December 2019, the FTC challenged Illumina Inc.’s acquisition of Pacific Biosciences of California, Inc., a biotech innovator that the FTC alleged was a potential future competitor of Illumina.", "The FTC not only sued under Section 7 of the Clayton Act, the statute enacted in 1950 specifically to challenge mergers, but also under Section 2 of the Sherman Act, alleging a never-tried theory that the acquisition was the improper act of an alleged monopolist.", "The companies abandoned the deal after the complaint was filed.", "In August 2019, the DOJ tried, but failed, to block the merger of Sabre Corp. and Farelogix in United States v. Sabre, where the Antitrust Division argued the killer acquisition theory.", "More recently, in November 2020, the DOJ sued Visa Inc. to block its acquisition of Plaid Inc. The parties recently abandoned the deal, but the complaint acknowledged that the payments platform and the information technology software developer are not currently competitors.", "The complaint had alleged that Visa did the deal to prevent Plaid from becoming a competitor. The DOJ sued under both Section 7 of the Clayton Act and Section 2 of the Sherman Act, similar to the FTC’s approach in Illumina.", "The same theory echoes throughout the FTC’s challenge to Facebook’s consummated acquisitions of Instagram and WhatsApp brought under Section 2 of the Sherman Act.", "In addition to increased enforcement activity by the FTC and DOJ, Congress has shown bipartisan interest in targeting technology platforms through antitrust.", "In a 450-page report published in October 2020 following an investigation into digital markets, the Democratic majority on the House Judiciary Subcommittee on Antitrust, Commercial and Administrative Law called for legislation to break up large technology firms, overturn court decisions it perceived as barring plaintiffs from prevailing in antitrust suits, and classify certain mergers as presumptively unlawful.", "The subcommittee called out “dominant” technology firms for this special treatment, recommending that they be required to prove that any transaction, even a vertical merger, is necessary to serve the public interest and that the benefits from the deal could not alternatively be achieved through organic growth.", "Several members of the Republican minority signed a companion report that, among other things, similarly recommended shifting the burden of proof to favor the plaintiff.", "The Biden administration’s Antitrust Division and FTC are expected to continue to challenge technology deals under novel theories to accomplish through the courts what the subcommittee has recommended.", "With Democrats controlling the House and the Senate, legislative action is not out of the question, but a statute codifying the subcommittee’s recommendation would diverge from decades of legal precedent, which makes it unlikely.", "In addition to increased enforcement activity by the FTC and DOJ, Congress has shown bipartisan interest in targeting technology platforms through antitrust.", "The approach to enforcement by the two current Democratic FTC commissioners perhaps gives the best glimpse into the next four years.", "Since they were sworn in on May 2, 2018, Commissioners Rebecca Kelly Slaughter and Rohit Chopra have consistently called on the commission to increase its scrutiny of vertical mergers.", "In dissenting statements, both criticized the June 2020 updated Vertical Merger Guidelines jointly published by the Antitrust Division and the FTC.", "The guidelines, which had not been updated since 1984, summarize the types of competitive harm the agencies consider when evaluating vertical mergers and describe the types of pro-competitive benefits that lead the agencies to conclude that vertical mergers should not be blocked.", "The 2020 updates did not break meaningfully from the agencies’ historical approach, and the two Democratic commissioners made clear they would have done so.", "Commissioner Slaughter sought to “disavow the false assertion that vertical mergers are almost always procompetitive,” arguing that the guidelines are “inexplicably mute on the well-known and well-supported fact that the potential anticompetitive harms from raising rivals’ costs and foreclosure are also ‘distinct considerations’ in vertical-merger analysis.”", "In his dissent, Commissioner Chopra argued that lax vertical enforcement had stifled competition by creating incentives for startup firms to be purchased by dominant market participants rather than compete to supplant them.", "Commissioners Slaughter and Chopra previously dissented in two commission votes not to challenge vertical mergers.", "When the commission voted to allow Staples, Inc.’s acquisition of Essendant Inc. with behavioral remedies in January 2019, Commissioner Slaughter dissented on the ground that FTC staff had “identified significant evidence of likely harm” and the companies had not “provided evidence showing that the merger’s likely harm is offset by cognizable procompetitive benefits.”", "She called for “a requirement that the parties substantiate the magnitude and merger-specificity of the claimed benefits in the same way the Commission endeavors to substantiate theories of harm.”", "Commissioner Chopra noted in his dissent that “[i]ncreased buyer power exerted by the combined firm against its upstream trading partners in this matter would not be an efficiency at all if it stems from an increase in market power on the buy side of the market.”", "A month later, in In re Fresenius Medical Care, Commissioner Chopra argued that “vertical mergers in health care markets choke off entry by small startups and other firms” and ultimately hurt patients.", "Fresenius, one of only two major providers of hemodialysis services through a chain of clinics and related equipment, was buying a company that offered equipment for in-home hemodialysis.", "He asserted that the acquisition would severely limit the incentive for new entrants in the at-home dialysis market, because one of the two major manufacturers and customers would now have an in-house option.", "The more pro-enforcement positions by the Democratic commissioners in these cases, along with the more aggressive actions by the Trump-appointed Republicans at the DOJ and the FTC on vertical mergers and in technology markets, provide a good road map of the type of enforcement that we may see once the Biden administration appoints new leadership at the antitrust agencies.", "Because of the less conventional approach by the Trump enforcers, we may not see more substantial change from the Biden team than one might ordinarily anticipate when a Democratic administration replaces a Republican one.", "However, the enforcement posture of the new administration will depend in large part on whether President Biden appoints traditional Democratic enforcers or more aggressive, populist-minded personnel.", "Prior to his inauguration, the president identified many former officials from the Obama era to serve in his administration, but the approach of the two Democratic FTC commissioners has been more progressive than the Obama-era antitrust convention.", "With the recent announcements that Chairman Joseph J. Simons will step down on January 29, 2021, and that the new administration plans to nominate Commissioner Chopra to head up the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, President Biden will have at least two slots to fill at the FTC, in addition to the head of the DOJ’s Antitrust Division.", "In the meantime, Commissioner Slaughter will lead the agency as FTC chairman.", "This memorandum is provided by Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom LLP and its affiliates for educational and informational purposes only and is not intended and should not be construed as legal advice.", "This memorandum is considered advertising under applicable state laws."]}

users have no alternative to Facebook, fueling its unfettered growth without competition and further entrenching its position.", "The two most obvious examples of this successful strategy were Instagram and WhatsApp — both which posed a unique and dire threat to Facebook’s monopoly.", "Facebook and Zuckerberg saw Instagram as a direct threat quickly after the company launched. After initially trying to build its own version of Instagram that gained no traction, Zuckerberg admitted, in early 2012, that Facebook was “very behind” Instagram and a better strategy would be “to consider paying a lot of money” for the photo-sharing app in an effort to “neutralize a potential competitor.”", "A few months later, in April 2012, Facebook acquired Instagram for $1 billion, despite the company not having a single cent of revenue and valuing itself at only $500 million.", "Zuckerberg offered Instagram’s owners double the valuation that Instagram came up with even though Zuckerberg previously described the initial $500 million value as “crazy.”", "$100 Million Isn’t Cool. You Know What’s Cool?…$19 Billion – Purchase of WhatsApp", "The mobile messaging app WhatsApp also posed a unique threat to Facebook’s growth, giving users the ability to send messages on their mobile devices both one-to-one and to groups.", "While Facebook focused on several emerging mobile messaging services, WhatsApp was viewed as the “category leader” with over 400 million active users worldwide in 2014, and the one that could potentially provide the greatest threat.", "Facebook feared WhatsApp eroding its monopoly power, stating WhatsApp or similar products posed “the biggest competitive threat we face as a business.”", "Facebook was also concerned that WhatsApp could ultimately be bought by a competing behemoth that had previously shown interest in social networking — namely Google.", "This led Facebook, in February 2014, to acquire WhatsApp for nearly $19 billion — wildly more than the extravagant price Zuckerberg had recommended paying a few months earlier and the $100 million another competitor offered to buy the company two years earlier.", "Here Today, Gone Tomorrow – Cutting Competitors Off from Facebook Overnight", "As laid out in today’s complaint, Facebook targets competitors with a ‘buy or bury’ approach: if they refuse to be bought out, Facebook tries to squeeze every bit of oxygen out of the room for these companies.", "To facilitate this goal, Facebook has used an “open first–closed later” strategy to stop competitive threats, or deter them from competing, at the inception.", "Facebook opened its platform to apps created by third-party developers in an effort to increase functionality on the site and, subsequently, increase the number of users on Facebook.", "Facebook also drove traffic to third-party sites by making it easier for users to sign in, so that Facebook could capture valuable data about its users’ off-Facebook activity and enhance its ability to target advertising.", "Not only did Facebook benefit monetarily through the third-party developers’ revenue, but Facebook’s services were expanded, as Facebook did not have the capacity to create and develop all the useful social features offered through third-party developers.", "After years of promoting open access to its platform, in 2011, Facebook began to rescind and block access to the site to apps that Facebook viewed as actual or potential competitive threats.", "Facebook understands that an abrupt termination of established access to the site can be devastating to an app — especially one still relatively new to the market.", "An app that suddenly loses access to Facebook is hurt not only because its users can no longer bring their friend lists to the new app, but also because a sudden loss of functionality — which creates broken or buggy features — suggests to users that an app is unstable.", "In the past, some of these companies experienced almost overnight drop-off in user engagement and downloads, and their growth stalled.", "Facebook’s response to competitors also serves as a warning to other apps that if they encroach on Facebook’s territory, Facebook will end their access to crucial integrations.", "Additionally, Facebook’s actions deter venture capitalists from investing in companies that Facebook might in the future see as competitors.", "As a consequence of Facebook’s expansive user base and the vast trove of data it collects from its users and users’ connections, Facebook is able to sell highly targeted advertising that firms greatly value.", "The volume, velocity, and variety of Facebook’s user data give it an unprecedented, virtually 360-degree view of users and their contacts, interests, preferences, and activities.", "The more users Facebook can acquire and convince to spend additional time on its platforms, the more data Facebook can accumulate by surveilling the activities of its users and thereby increase its revenues through advertising — reaping the company billions every month.", "Facebook is specifically charged with violating Section 2 of the Sherman Act, in addition to multiple violations of Section 7 of the Clayton Act.", "Attorney General James and the coalition ask the court to halt Facebook’s illegal, anticompetitive conduct and block the company from continuing this behavior in the future.", "Additionally, the coalition asks the court to restrain Facebook from making further acquisitions valued at or in excess of $10 million without advance notice to the state of New York and other plaintiff states.", "Finally, the court is asked to provide any additional relief it determines is appropriate, including the divestiture or restructuring of illegally acquired companies, or current Facebook assets or business lines.", "The complaint was filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia.", "Separately, but in coordination with the coalition led by Attorney General James, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) also today filed a complaint against Facebook in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia.", "Attorney General James wishes to thank the FTC for its close working relationship and collaboration during this investigation.", "Attorney General James leads this lawsuit with an executive committee comprised of the attorneys general of California, Colorado, Florida, Iowa, Nebraska, North Carolina,

In exchange for joining Facebook, the company would give him enormous resources with which to build Instagram and let him run it as CEO.", "Systrom agreed, and among the reasons he shared with his board was “if Facebook took measures to copy Instagram or target the app directly, that would make it a lot more difficult to grow,” Frier reported.", "Facebook’s orientation guide for new employees contained the sentence, “If we don’t create the thing that kills Facebook, something else will.”", "Systrom famously sold the company for $1 billion, though the final purchase price was $715 million, as the deal closed in the aftermath of Facebook’s famously rocky IPO, when the company’s stock had lost much of its value.", "(It recovered!) The deal underwent a standard review by the Federal Trade Commission in which each company hired its own lawyers to look for any evidence that the deal was anti-competitive and should not be approved.", "Facebook argued that it did not compete with Instagram directly — but that Facebook Camera, a recently launched photo sharing app, did and was one of dozens of photo sharing apps on the market.", "This approach neatly set aside the true strategic value of Instagram, which lay in helping Facebook amass the largest user base in the world, around which it would go on to build a dominant advertising business.", "And that value was not widely apparent; when the deal was announced, CNN opined that Zuckerberg was “paying a steep price for a startup that has lots of buzz but no business model.”", "Zuckerberg’s emails suggest he knew better than regulators how valuable acquiring Instagram would be for Facebook", "The FTC declined to prosecute, in part because antitrust regulation since the 1960s has been based on the idea of consumer harm, measured largely through price increases.", "Because both Facebook and Instagram offered their services for free, the FTC believed it would have difficulty proving that the deal would harm consumers.", "One probable outcome of the congressional antitrust hearing is a refinement of that standard to more closely scrutinize deals like these.", "Both Facebook and Instagram were much smaller in 2012 than they are today, and it was then unclear that Instagram, in particular, would evolve to become something much bigger than a photo sharing app.", "In recent years, as it surged past 1 billion users, it effectively became a sequel to the original Facebook — an all-purpose social network with a much younger audience than its parent company.", "“I think the FTC had all of these documents ... and unanimously voted at the time not to challenge the acquisition,” Zuckerberg said on Wednesday.", "“In hindsight, it probably looks obvious that Instagram would have reached the scale that it has today.", "The FTC completed its review of the acquisition in the summer of 2012 without holding any open hearings or issuing a public report.", "The agency noted it might reopen the inquiry at an unspecified future date, “as the public interest may require.”", "The United Kingdom’s Office of Fair Trading also reviewed the deal, as did — in a rare move — the California Department of Corporations.", "Neither found any reason to block the deal. Within a few months of the acquisition, Instagram and its 80 million users belonged to Facebook.", "Still, Zuckerberg’s emails suggest he knew better than regulators how valuable acquiring Instagram — and other competitive startups — would be for Facebook.", "“Google+ is a red herring,” a senior engineer wrote in an internal Facebook thread in January 2012. “We are getting distracted by a shitty clone while guys like Instragram and Pinterest ramp up and create new markets that we should’ve seen coming.”", "After the Instagram deal closed, Zuckerberg emailed the engineer, referencing the post. “I remember your internal post about how Instagram was our threat and not Google+,” he said.", "“You were basically right. One thing about startups is you can often acquire them.”", "“One reason people underestimate the importance of watching Google is that we can likely just always buy any competitive startups,” Zuckerberg emailed another employee who wrote to congratulate him on the Instagram acquisition."]}

have completed, and are now making available to academic researchers, one of the largest social science datasets ever constructed.", "We processed approximately an exabyte (a quintillion bytes, or a billion gigabytes) of raw data from the platform.", "The dataset itself contains a total of more than 10 trillion numbers that summarize information about 38 million URLs shared worldwide more than 100 times publicly on Facebook (between 1/1/2017 and 7/31/2019).", "It also includes characteristics of the URLs (such as in which country they were shared and whether they were fact-checked or flagged by users as hate speech) and the aggregated data concerning the types of people who viewed, shared, liked, reacted to, shared without viewing, and otherwise interacted with these links.", "This dataset enables social scientists to study some of the most important questions of our time about the effects of social media on democracy and elections with information to which they have never before had access.", "When Facebook originally agreed to make data available to academics through a structure we developed (King and Persily, 2019, GaryKing.org/partnerships) and Mark Zuckerberg testified about our idea before Congress, we thought this day would take about two months of work; it has taken twenty.", "Since the original Request for Proposals was announced, we have been able to approve large numbers of researchers, and we continue to do so.", "When this project began, we thought the political and legal aspects of our job were over, and we merely needed to identify, prepare, and document data for researchers with our Facebook counterparts.", "In fact, most of the last twenty months has involved negotiating with Facebook over their increasingly conservative views of privacy and the law, trying to get different groups within the company on the same page, and watching Facebook build an information security and data privacy infrastructure adequate to share data with academics.", "The difficult lessons we learned in the production of this dataset may be useful for other platforms, governments, and academics going forward with many types of data sharing projects.", "It turned out that Facebook's legal, engineering, and data science infrastructures were not prepared for a data sharing initiative of the magnitude we jointly envisioned.", "It has taken dozens of employees countless hours, since then, to build all that is necessary for data sharing with independent academic researchers.", "Along the way, we also facilitated access to the Crowdtangle and Ad Library APIs, which researchers are finding useful.", "We have also begun to develop with Facebook a survey protocol in which respondents to several prominent academic surveys will have an opportunity to give consent to enable researchers to simultaneously analyze their survey responses with information about their activities on Facebook.", "The greatest barrier we have faced concerned Facebook’s interpretation of the relevant privacy restrictions contained in the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) from the European Union and the consent decree they operate under with the Federal Trade Commission.", "They sometimes take the position that those restrictions prevent researchers from analyzing individual level data, even if de-identified or aggregated.", "We disagree with these legal interpretations, and we think, in particular, that recent guidance from the European Data Protection Supervisor on research under GDPR, supports a more permissive interpretation with respect to academic data sharing for public good.", "However, we are not the ones who have had to pay a five billion dollar fine in the wake of the Cambridge Analytica scandal, and we would not be on the hook if our legal interpretation did not win the day in court or with regulators.", "So while we disagree with the hard line Facebook has taken on privacy and academic data sharing, we understand the legal context in which these arguments are made.", "At the same time, we encourage the European Commission and the FTC both to create clearly defined safe harbors specifically for research on social media data, and even to mandate that these companies share privacy-protected data with independent academics under a broad regulatory regime aimed at transparency.", "Only then will the legal equities shift in favor of independent analysis of the political phenomena taking place on the platforms that govern an unprecedented amount of the world’s political communication and social interaction.", "To facilitate data access while complying with Facebook’s interpretation of the applicable privacy laws, we agreed to move forward with a regime of “differential privacy” as applied to the URLs dataset.", "Differential privacy describes a suite of technologies that introduce statistical noise and censoring into datasets (or in results from those datasets) in order to prevent reidentification of any given individual who may be represented in the data.", "We had thought that aggregating data at the URL level instead of providing individual level data, vetting researchers through our process, and monitoring and auditing all analyses would provide the necessary privacy protection.", "But after over a year of discussion, it became clear that applying differential privacy would be a legally acceptable path forward for Facebook.", "We disagreed with Facebook’s legal view, but the technology is now being used by the U.S. Census Bureau and other leading technology companies, and regulators seem to find it acceptable for sharing data in ways they would not otherwise allow.", "We think of differential privacy as a technological solution to a political problem, just as the organizational structure we proposed for this project is an innovation in constitutional design that solved a different political problem.", "Recognizing that differential privacy represented a way to surmount the roadblocks to data access we had experienced, we undertook a substantial research program to build new methodologies that enable researchers to make discoveries with differentially private data, to fix the methodological challenges this technology poses for social scientists, and to reduce the risks it may pose to society at large.", "Differential privacy works by censoring certain values in the data and adding specially calibrated noise to statistical results or data cell values.", "This appropriately obscures any individual’s actions who may be in the data. However, from a statistical point of view, censoring and noise are the same as selection bias and measurement error bias -- both serious statistical issues.", "It makes no sense to go through all this effort to provide data to researchers only to have researchers (and society at large) being misled and drawing the wrong conclusions about the effects of social media on elections and democracy.", "We thus set out to solve these statistical problems and have now released two papers intended to help, along with open source software (see Evans and King, 2020, GaryKing.org/dp; Evans, King, Schwenzfeier, and Thakura, 2019, GaryKing.org/dpd).", "Facebook is now implementing these methods in ways that will scale to the massively sized datasets we are releasing today.", "This enables the release of the URLs dataset in ways that protect individual privacy along with methods and software that protect researchers and society from biased conclusions.", "And our organizational design continues to protect us all, because Facebook has abided by its promise to let us approve researchers for data access without any involvement from the company or any pre-publication approval of academic research findings.", "The privacy protective procedures instituted mean that researchers will not be able to learn about any individual or their actions, and small groups will also be obscured in the data which may make certain valid research questions impossible.", "Most conclusions drawn will be more uncertain than if researchers had access to the original data, but the original data is not on offer.", "In most situations, analyzing the data we are releasing with the methods we are making available will be statistically equivalent to having a large sample rather than the entire dataset, a situation to which researchers are already accustomed.", "We are hopeful that the dataset provided will enable the social science research community to gain unprecedented insights into behavior and communication on social media in ways that will benefit the public quite broadly.", "There are variables in this dataset -- such as URLs exposure data -- that have never been provided by an internet company for academic research.", "We are confident that the researchers who have already been awarded access through our process, as well as those who are now applying and gain access through our procedures at Social Science One, will publish important results, critical for understanding life, democracy, elections, and modern communication.", "We have recommended to Facebook that all research teams previously approved but delayed be given immediate access to this dataset.", "Others who have appllied will receive access too. If you have a great idea for the analysis of this dataset, please see our RFP and send us a proposal."]}

We talked about stuff that was important to Zuck, where I had useful experience.", "When I sent that email to Zuck and Sheryl, I assumed that Facebook was a victim. What I learned in the months that followed–about the 2016 election, about the spread of Brexit lies, about data on users being sold to other groups–shocked and disappointed me.", "It took me a very long time to accept that success had blinded Zuck and Sheryl to the consequences of their actions.", "I have never had a reason to bite Facebook’s hand. Even at this writing, I still own shares in Facebook.", "My criticism of the company is a matter of principle, and owning shares is a good way to make that point.", "I became an activist because I was among the first to see a catastrophe unfolding, and my history with the company made me a credible voice.", "This is a story of my journey. It is a story about power. About privilege. About trust, and how it can be abused.", "The massive success of Facebook eventually led to catastrophe. The business model depends on advertising, which in turn depends on manipulating the attention of users so they see more ads.", "One of the best ways to manipulate attention is to appeal to outrage and fear, emotions that increase engagement.", "Facebook’s algorithms give users what they want, so each person’s News Feed becomes a unique reality, a filter bubble that creates the illusion that most people the user knows believe the same things.", "Showing users only posts they agree with was good for Facebook’s bottom line, but some research showed it also increased polarization and, as we learned, harmed democracy.", "To feed its AI and algorithms, Facebook gathered data anywhere it could. Before long, Facebook was spying on everyone, including people who do not use Facebook.", "Unfortunately for users, Facebook failed to safeguard that data. Facebook sometimes traded the data to get better business deals.", "These things increased user count and time on-site, but it took another innovation to make Facebook’s advertising business a giant success.", "From late 2012 to 2017, Facebook perfected a new idea–growth hacking–where it experimented constantly with algorithms, new data types and small changes in design, measuring everything.", "Growth hacking enabled Facebook to monetize its oceans of data so effectively that growth-hacking metrics blocked out all other considerations.", "In the world of growth hacking, users are a metric, not people. Every action a user took gave Facebook a better understanding of that user–and of that user’s friends–enabling the company to make tiny “improvements” in the user experience every day, which is to say it got better at manipulating the attention of users.", "Any advertiser could buy access to that attention. The Russians took full advantage. If civic responsibility ever came up in Facebook’s internal conversations, I can see no evidence of it.", "The people at Facebook live in their own bubble. Zuck has always believed that connecting everyone on earth was a mission so important that it justified any action necessary to accomplish it.", "Convinced of the nobility of their mission, Zuck and his employees seem to listen to criticism without changing their behavior.", "They respond to nearly every problem with the same approach that created the problem in the first place: more AI, more code, more short-term fixes.", "They do not do this because they are bad people. They do this because success has warped their perception of reality.", "They cannot imagine that the recent problems could be in any way linked to their designs or business decisions.", "It would never occur to them to listen to critics–How many billion people have the critics connected?–much less to reconsider the way they do business.", "As a result, when confronted with evidence that disinformation and fake news had spread over Facebook and may have influenced a British referendum or an election in the U.S., Facebook followed a playbook it had run since its founding: deny, delay, deflect, dissemble.", "Facebook only came clean when forced to, and revealed as little information as possible. Then it went to Plan B: apologize, and promise to do better.", "Thanks to Facebook’s extraordinary success, Zuck’s brand in the tech world combines elements of rock star and cult leader.", "He is deeply committed to products and not as interested in the rest of the business, which he leaves to Sandberg.", "According to multiple reports, Zuck is known for micromanaging products and for being decisive. He is the undisputed boss.", "Zuck’s subordinates study him and have evolved techniques for influencing him. Sheryl Sandberg is brilliant, ambitious and supremely well organized.", "Given Zuck’s status as the founder, the team at Facebook rarely, if ever, challenged him on the way up and did not do so when bad times arrived.", "(A Facebook spokesperson replies: “People disagree with Mark all the time.”)", "You would think that Facebook’s users would be outraged by the way the platform has been used to undermine democracy, human rights, privacy, public health and innovation.", "Some are, but nearly 1.5 billion people use Facebook every day. They use it to stay in touch with distant relatives and friends.", "They like to share their photos and their thoughts. They do not want to believe that the same platform that has become a powerful habit is also responsible for so much harm.", "Facebook has leveraged our trust of family and friends to build one of the most valuable businesses in the world, but in the process, it has been careless with user data and aggravated the flaws in our democracy while leaving citizens ever less capable of thinking for themselves, knowing whom to trust or acting in their own interest.", "Bad actors have had a field day exploiting Facebook and Google, leveraging user trust to spread disinformation and hate speech, to suppress voting and to polarize citizens in many countries.", "They will continue to do so until we, in our role as citizens, reclaim our right to self-determination.", "We need to begin to reform Facebook and Big Tech in these key areas:", "Democracy depends on shared facts and values. It depends on deliberation and the rule of law. It depends on having a free press and other countervailing forces to hold the powerful accountable.", "Facebook (along with Google and Twitter) has undercut the free press from two directions: it has eroded the economics of journalism and then overwhelmed it with disinformation.", "On Facebook, information and disinformation look the same; the only difference is that disinformation generates more revenue, so it gets better treatment.", "To Facebook, facts are not an absolute; they are a choice to be left initially to users and their friends but then magnified by algorithms to promote engagement.", "In the same vein, Facebook’s algorithms promote extreme messages over neutral ones, which can elevate disinformation over information, conspiracy theories over facts.", "Like-minded people can share their views, but they can also block out any fact or perspective with which they disagree.", "At Facebook’s scale–or Google’s–there is no way to avoid influencing the lives of users and the future of nations.", "Recent history suggests that the threat to democracy is real. The efforts to date by Facebook, Google and Twitter to protect future elections may be sincere, but there is no reason to think they will do anything more than start a game of whack-a-mole with those who choose to interfere.", "Only fundamental changes to business models can reduce the risk to democracy. Facebook remains a threat to the powerless around the world.", "The company’s Free Basics service has brought Internet service to poor people in roughly 60 countries, but at the cost of massive social disruption.", "Lack of language skills and cultural insensitivity have blinded Facebook to the ways in which its platform can be used to harm defenseless minorities.", "This has already played out with deadly outcomes in Sri Lanka and Myanmar.", "Facebook remains a threat to privacy. The company’s commitment to surveillance would make an intelligence agency proud, but not so its handling of data.", "There need to be versions of Facebook News Feed and all search results that are free of manipulation.", "Users need to own their data and have absolute control over how it gets used. Users have a right to know the name of every organization and person who has their data.", "This would apply not just to the platforms but also to cellular carriers and the third parties that gain access to user data.", "Another important regulatory opportunity is data portability, such that users can move everything of value from one platform to another.", "This would help enable startups to overcome an otherwise insurmountable barrier to adoption. Platforms should also be transparent to users, advertisers and regulators.", "Users should always own all their own data and metadata–and they should be compensated much better for it.", "No one should be able to use a user’s data in any way without explicit, prior consent. Third-party audits of algorithms, comparable to what exists now for financial statements, would create the transparency necessary to limit undesirable consequences.", "There should be limits on what kind of data can be collected, such that users can limit data collection or choose privacy.", "This needs to be done immediately, before new products like Alexa and Google Home reach mass adoption.", "Smart home devices are currently an untamed frontier of data, with the potential for massive abuse. Lastly, I would like to prevent deployment of advanced technologies like artificial intelligence and automated bots without proof that they serve humans rather than exploit them.", "This could be accomplished through an equivalent to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for technology.", "If I consider Google, Amazon and Facebook purely in investment terms, I cannot help but be impressed by the brilliant way they have executed their business plans.", "The problem is unintended consequences, which are more numerous and severe than we can afford. Google and Facebook are artificially profitable because they do not pay for the damage they cause.", "The U.S. economy has historically depended on startups far more than other economies, especially in technology.", "If my hypothesis is correct, the country has begun a risky experiment in depending on monopolists for innovation, economic growth and job creation.", "Google, Amazon and Facebook have followed the monopolist’s playbook and built “no go” zones around their core operations.", "Their success has raised the bar for startups, narrowing the opportunities for outsize success and forcing entrepreneurs to sell out early or pursue opportunities with less potential.", "They have built additional walls through the acquisition of startups that might have posed a competitive threat.", "These companies do not need to choke off startup activities to be successful, but they cannot help themselves.", "In terms of economic policy, I want to set limits on the markets in which monopoly-class players like Facebook, Google and Amazon can operate.", "The economy would benefit from breaking them up. A first step would be to prevent acquisitions, as well as cross subsidies and data sharing among products within each platform.", "I favor regulation as a way to reduce harmful behavior. The most effective regulations will force changes in business models.", "Relative to today’s standards, these recommendations sound extreme, but there may be no other way to protect children, adults, democracy and the economy.", "Our parents and grandparents had a similar day of reckoning with tobacco. Now it’s our turn, this time with Internet platforms.", "From a technology perspective, the most promising path forward is through innovation, something over which the platforms have too much influence today.", "Antitrust enforcement can create space for innovation, but we need more. I propose that Silicon Valley embrace human-driven technology as the Next Big Thing.", "In America, if you want to solve a problem, it helps to incorporate the profit motive, which we can do by shifting the focus of technology from exploiting the weakest links in human psychology to a commitment to empowering users.", "What would human-driven technology look like? It would empower users rather than exploit them. Human-driven social networks would enable sharing with friends, but without massive surveillance, filter bubbles and data insecurity.", "In exchange for adopting a benign business model, perhaps based on subscriptions, startups would receive protection from the giants.", "Given that social media is practically a public utility, I think it is worth considering more aggressive strategies, including government subsidies.", "The government already subsidizes energy exploration, agriculture and other economic activities that the country considers to be a priority, and it is not crazy to imagine that civically responsible social media may be essential to the future of the country.", "The subsidies might come in the form of research funding, capital for startups, tax breaks and the like.", "The Next Big Thing offers opportunities to rethink the architecture of the Internet. For example, I would like to address privacy with a new model of authentication for website access that permits websites to gather only the minimum amount of data required for each transaction.", "It would work like a password manager, but with a couple of important distinctions: it would go beyond storing passwords to performing log-ins, and it would store private data on the device, not in the cloud.", "Apple has embraced this model, offering its customers valuable privacy and security advantages over Android.", "All the public-health threats of Internet platforms derive from design choices. Technology has the power to persuade, and the financial incentives of advertising business models guarantee that persuasion will always be the default goal of every design.", "Every pixel on every screen of every Internet app has been tuned to influence users’ behavior. Not every user can be influenced all the time, but nearly all users can be influenced some of the time.", "In the most extreme cases, users develop behavioral addictions that can lower their quality of life and that of family members, co-workers and close friends.", "We don’t know the prevalence of behavioral addictions to the Internet, but anecdotally they seem widespread.", "Millions of people check their phone first thing in the morning. For most, the big question is whether they do so before they pee or while they are peeing.", "Far too many people report difficulty sleeping because they cannot stop using their phone or tablet. It is possible that most of Facebook’s daily users have some level of behavioral addiction.", "The problem with addiction is that it deprives the victim of agency. Even when an addict understands the potential for harm, he or she cannot help but continue the activity.", "To change that will require more than regulation. It will require an investment in research and public-health services to counter Internet addiction.", "A growing percentage of children prefer the hyperstimulation of virtual experiences to the real world.", "Products like Instagram empower bullies. Texting has replaced conversation for many kids. It’s hard to know how this will turn out, but some medical researchers have raised alarms, noting that we have allowed unsupervised psychological experiments on millions of people.", "Medical research bolsters the case for regulation. In addition to limits on the ages at which children may use screens like smartphones and tablets, there is evidence that phones and computers can cause distraction in classrooms.", "The harm to public health, democracy, privacy and competition caused by Facebook and other platforms results from their business models, which must be changed.", "As users, we have more power to force change than we realize. We can alter our behavior. We can create a political movement.", "We can insist on government intervention to promote human-driven technology as an alternative to extractive technology.", "At the same time, the government must take steps to repair the damage from Internet platforms. We need to rebuild institutions, find common ground with those with whom we disagree, and start acting like one country again.", "The political and social power of Facebook and the other Internet platforms is unhealthy and inappropriate in a democracy like ours.", "We must hold them accountable and insist on real-world solutions, not more code.", "Editor’s note: Invited to respond, Facebook pointed to a 2018 post by Sheryl Sandberg detailing the company’s efforts on user privacy, democracy, security and other issues.", "McNamee has been a Silicon Valley investor for 35 years.

If I get through this speech, it’ll be the first time I actually finish something at Harvard.", "I’m an unlikely speaker, not just because I dropped out, but because we’re technically in the same generation.", "We walked this yard less than a decade apart, studied the same ideas and slept through the same Ec10 lectures.", "We may have taken different paths to get here, especially if you came all the way from the Quad, but today I want to share what I’ve learned about our generation and the world we’re building together.", "But first, the last couple of days have brought back a lot of good memories.", "How many of you remember exactly what you were doing when you got that email telling you that you got into Harvard?", "I was playing Civilization and I ran downstairs, got my dad, and for some reason, his reaction was to video me opening the email.", "That could have been a really sad video. I swear getting into Harvard is still the thing my parents are most proud of me for.", "What about your first lecture at Harvard? Mine was Computer Science 121 with the incredible Harry Lewis.", "I was late so I threw on a t-shirt and didn’t realize until afterwards it was inside out and backwards with my tag sticking out the front.", "I couldn’t figure out why no one would talk to me — except one guy, KX Jin, he just went with it. We ended up doing our problem sets together, and now he runs a big part of Facebook.", "And that, Class of 2017, is why you should be nice to people.", "But my best memory from Harvard was meeting Priscilla. I had just launched this prank website Facemash, and the ad board wanted to “see me”.", "Everyone thought I was going to get kicked out. My parents came to help me pack. My friends threw me a going away party.", "As luck would have it, Priscilla was at that party with her friend. We met in line for the bathroom in the Pfoho Belltower, and in what must be one of the all time romantic lines, I said: “I’m going to get kicked out in three days, so we need to go on a date quickly.”", "Actually, any of you graduating can use that line.", "I didn’t end up getting kicked out — I did that to myself. Priscilla and I started dating. And, you know, that movie made it seem like Facemash was so important to creating Facebook.", "It wasn’t. But without Facemash I wouldn’t have met Priscilla, and she’s the most important person in my life, so you could say it was the most important thing I built in my time here.", "We’ve all started lifelong friendships here, and some of us even families. That’s why I’m so grateful to this place.", "Today I want to talk about purpose. But I’m not here to give you the standard commencement about finding your purpose.", "We’re millennials. We’ll try to do that instinctively. Instead, I’m here to tell you finding your purpose isn’t enough.", "The challenge for our generation is creating a world where everyone has a sense of purpose.", "One of my favorite stories is when John F Kennedy visited the NASA space center, he saw a janitor carrying a broom and he walked over and asked what he was doing.", "The janitor responded: “Mr. President, I’m helping put a man on the moon”.", "Purpose is that sense that we are part of something bigger than ourselves, that we are needed, that we have something better ahead to work for.", "You’re graduating at a time when this is especially important. When our parents graduated, purpose reliably came from your job, your church, your community.", "But today, technology and automation are eliminating many jobs. Membership in communities is declining.", "Many people feel disconnected and depressed, and are trying to fill a void.", "As I’ve traveled around, I’ve sat with children in juvenile detention and opioid addicts, who told me their lives could have turned out differently if they just had something to do, an after school program or somewhere to go.", "I’ve met factory workers who know their old jobs aren’t coming back and are trying to find their place.", "To keep our society moving forward, we have a generational challenge — to not only create new jobs, but create a renewed sense of purpose.", "I remember the night I launched Facebook from my little dorm in Kirkland House. I went to Noch’s with my friend KX.", "I remember telling him I was excited to connect the Harvard community, but one day someone would connect the whole world.", "The thing is, it never even occurred to me that someone might be us. We were just college kids. We didn’t know anything about that.", "There were all these big technology companies with resources. I just assumed one of them would do it.", "But this idea was so clear to us — that all people want to connect. So we just kept moving forward, day by day.", "I know a lot of you will have your own stories just like this. A change in the world that seems so clear you’re sure someone else will do it.", "But it’s not enough to have purpose yourself. You have to create a sense of purpose for others.", "I found that out the hard way. You see, my hope was never to build a company, but to make an impact. And as all these people started joining us, I just assumed that’s what they cared about too, so I never explained what I hoped we’d build.", "A couple years in, some big companies wanted to buy us. I didn’t want to sell. I wanted to see if we could connect more people.", "We were building the first News Feed, and I thought if we could just launch this, it could change how we learn about the world.", "Nearly everyone else wanted to sell. Without a sense of higher purpose, this was the startup dream come true.", "It tore our company apart. After one tense argument, an advisor told me if I didn’t agree to sell, I would regret the decision for the rest of my life.", "Relationships were so frayed that within a year or so every single person on the management team was gone.", "That was my hardest time leading Facebook. I believed in what we were doing, but I felt alone. And worse, it was my fault.", "I wondered if I was just wrong, an imposter, a 22 year-old kid who had no idea how the world worked.", "Now, years later, I understand that *is* how things work with no sense of higher purpose. It’s up to us to create it so we can all keep moving forward together.", "Today I want to talk about three ways to create a world where everyone has a sense of purpose: by taking on big meaningful projects together, by redefining equality so everyone has the freedom to pursue purpose, and by building community across the world.", "Our generation will have to deal with tens of millions of jobs replaced by automation like self-driving cars and trucks.", "But we have the potential to do so much more together.", "Every generation has its defining works. More than 300,000 people worked to put a man on the moon – including that janitor.", "Millions of volunteers immunized children around the world against polio. Millions of more people built the Hoover dam and other great projects.", "These projects didn’t just provide purpose for the people doing those jobs, they gave our whole country a sense of pride that we could do great things.", "Now it’s our turn to do great things. I know, you’re probably thinking: I don’t know how to build a dam, or get a million people involved in anything.", "But let me tell you a secret: no one does when they begin. Ideas don’t come out fully formed. They only become clear as you work on them.", "If I had to understand everything about connecting people before I began, I never would have started Facebook.", "Movies and pop culture get this all wrong. The idea of a single eureka moment is a dangerous lie. It makes us feel inadequate since we haven’t had ours.", "It prevents people with seeds of good ideas from getting started. Oh, you know what else movies get wrong about innovation?", "No one writes math formulas on glass. That’s not a thing.", "It’s good to be idealistic. But be prepared to be misunderstood. Anyone working on a big vision will get called crazy, even if you end up right.", "Anyone working on a complex problem will get blamed for not fully understanding the challenge, even though it’s impossible to know everything upfront.", "Anyone taking initiative will get criticized for moving too fast, because there’s always someone who wants to slow you down.", "In our society, we often don’t do big things because we’re so afraid of making mistakes that we ignore all the things wrong today if we do nothing.", "The reality is, anything we do will have issues in the future. But that can’t keep us from starting.", "So what are we waiting for? It’s time for our generation-defining public works. How about stopping climate change before we destroy the planet and getting millions of people involved manufacturing and installing solar panels?", "How about curing all diseases and asking volunteers to track their health data and share their genomes?", "Today we spend 50x more treating people who are sick than we spend finding cures so people don’t get sick in the first place.", "That makes no sense. We can fix this. How about modernizing democracy so everyone can vote online, and personalizing education so everyone can learn?", "These achievements are within our reach. Let’s do them all in a way that gives everyone in our society a role.", "Let’s do big things, not only to create progress, but to create purpose.", "So taking on big meaningful projects is the first thing we can do to create a world where everyone has a sense of purpose.", "The second is redefining equality to give everyone the freedom they need to pursue purpose.", "Many of our parents had stable jobs throughout their careers. Now we’re all entrepreneurial, whether we’re starting projects or finding or role.", "And that’s great. Our culture of entrepreneurship is how we create so much progress.", "Now, an entrepreneurial culture thrives when it’s easy to try lots of new ideas. Facebook wasn’t the first thing I built.", "I also built games, chat systems, study tools and music players. I’m not alone. JK Rowling got rejected 12 times before publishing Harry Potter.", "Even Beyonce had to make hundreds of songs to get Halo. The greatest successes come from having the freedom to fail.", "But today, we have a level of wealth inequality that hurts everyone. When you don’t have the freedom to take your idea and turn it into a historic enterprise, we all lose.", "Right now our society is way over-indexed on rewarding success and we don’t do nearly enough to make it easy for everyone to take lots of shots.", "Let’s face it. There is something wrong with our system when I can leave here and make billions of dollars in 10 years while millions of students can’t afford to pay off their loans, let alone start a business.", "Look, I know a lot of entrepreneurs, and I don’t know a single person who gave up on starting a business because they might not make enough money.", "But I know lots of people who haven’t pursued dreams because they didn’t have a cushion to fall back on if they failed.", "We all know we don’t succeed just by having a good idea or working hard. We succeed by being lucky too.", "If I had to support my family growing up instead of having time to code, if I didn’t know I’d be fine if Facebook didn’t work out, I wouldn’t be standing here today.", "If we’re honest, we all know how much luck we’ve had.", "Every generation expands its definition of equality. Previous generations fought for the vote and civil rights.", "They had the New Deal and Great Society. Now it’s our time to define a new social contract for our generation.", "We should have a society that measures progress not just by economic metrics like GDP, but by how many of us have a role we find meaningful.", "We should explore ideas like universal basic income to give everyone a cushion to try new things. We’re going to change jobs many times, so we need affordable childcare to get to work and healthcare that aren’t tied to one company.", "We’re all going to make mistakes, so we need a society that focuses less on locking us up or stigmatizing us.", "And as technology keeps changing, we need to focus more on continuous education throughout our lives.", "And yes, giving everyone the freedom to pursue purpose isn’t free. People like me should pay for it. Many of you will do well and you should too.", "That’s why Priscilla and I started the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative and committed our wealth to promoting equal opportunity.", "These are the values of our generation. It was never a question of if we were going to do this. The only question was when.", "Millennials are already one of the most charitable generations in history. In one year, three of four US millennials made a donation and seven out of ten raised money for charity.", "But it’s not just about money. You can also give time. I promise you, if you take an hour or two a week — that’s all it takes to give someone a hand, to help them reach their potential.", "Maybe you think that’s too much time. I used to. When Priscilla graduated from Harvard she became a teacher, and before she’d do education work with me, she told me I needed to teach a class.", "I complained: “Well, I’m kind of busy. I’m running this company.” But she insisted, so I taught a middle school program on entrepreneurship at the local Boys and Girls Club.", "I taught them lessons on product development and marketing, and they taught me what it’s like feeling targeted for your race and having a family member in prison.", "I shared stories from my time in school, and they shared their hope of one day going to college too. For five years now, I’ve been having dinner with those kids every month.", "One of them threw me and Priscilla our first baby shower. And next year they’re going to college. Every one of them.", "We can all make time to give someone a hand. Let’s give everyone the freedom to pursue their purpose — not only because it’s the right thing to do, but because when more people can turn their dreams into something great, we’re all better for it.", "Purpose doesn’t only come from work. The third way we can create a sense of purpose for everyone is by building community.", "And when our generation says “everyone”, we mean everyone in the world.", "Quick show of hands: how many of you are from another country? Now, how many of you are friends with one of these folks?", "In a survey asking millennials around the world what defines our identity, the most popular answer wasn’t nationality, religion or ethnicity, it was “citizen of the world”.", "Every generation expands the circle of people we consider “one of us”. For us, it now encompasses the entire world.", "We understand the great arc of human history bends towards people coming together in ever greater numbers — from tribes to cities to nations — to achieve things we couldn’t on our own.", "We get that our greatest opportunities are now global — we can be the generation that ends poverty, that ends disease.", "We get that our greatest challenges need global responses too — no country can fight climate change alone or prevent pandemics.", "Progress now requires coming together not just as cities or nations, but also as a global community.", "But we live in an unstable time. There are people left behind by globalization across the world. It’s hard to care about people in other places if we don’t feel good about our lives here at home.", "This is the struggle of our time. The forces of freedom, openness and global community against the forces of authoritarianism, isolationism and nationalism.", "Forces for the flow of knowledge, trade and immigration against those who would slow them down. This is not a battle of nations, it’s a battle of ideas.", "There are people in every country for global connection and good people against it.", "This isn’t going to be decided at the UN either. It’s going to happen at the local level, when enough of us feel a sense of purpose and stability in our own lives that we can open up and start caring about everyone.", "The best way to do that is to start building local communities right now.", "We all get meaning from our communities. Whether our communities are houses or sports teams, churches or music groups, they give us that sense we are part of something bigger, that we are not alone; they give us the strength to expand our horizons.", "That’s why it’s so striking that for decades, membership in all kinds of groups has declined as much as one-quarter.", "That’s a lot of people who now need to find purpose somewhere else.", "But I know we can rebuild our communities and start new ones because many of you already are.", "I met Agnes Igoye, who’s graduating today. Where are you, Agnes? She spent her childhood navigating conflict zones in Uganda, and now she trains thousands of law enforcement officers to keep communities safe.", "I met Kayla Oakley and Niha Jain, graduating today, too. Stand up. Kayla and Niha started a non-profit that connects people suffering from illnesses with people in their communities willing to help.", "I met David Razu Aznar, graduating from the Kennedy School today. David, stand up. He’s a former city councilor who successfully led the battle to make Mexico City the first Latin American city to pass marriage equality — even before San Francisco.", "This is my story too. A student in a dorm room, connecting one community at a time, and keeping at it until one day we connect the whole world.", "Change starts local. Even global changes start small — with people like us. In our generation, the struggle of whether we connect more, whether we achieve our biggest opportunities, comes down to this — your ability to build communities and create a world where every single person has a sense of purpose.", "Class of 2017, you are graduating into a world that needs purpose. It’s up to you to create it.", "Remember when I told you about that class I taught at the Boys and Girls Club? One day after class I was talking to them about college, and one of my top students raised his hand and said he wasn’t sure he could go because he’s undocumented.", "Last year I took him out to breakfast for his birthday. I wanted to get him a present, so I asked him and he started talking about students he saw struggling and said “You know, I’d really just like a book on social justice.”", "I was blown away. Here’s a young guy who has every reason to be cynical.

Increased scrutiny and criticism of the social network Zuckerberg had built into a behemoth.", "It’s well deserved given the sloppy way the company has handled a range of issues of late, including not monitoring how user data was abused by Cambridge Analytica, not stopping the Russians from manipulating the platform in the 2016 elections and allowing false news from suspect publishers like Infowars to be distributed on the platform.", "The controversies have landed Zuckerberg and Facebook in hearings here and in Europe and have tarnished his nerd-god image.", "In this 90-minute interview we talked about a range of things, from news to data to privacy to China to his political ambitions.", "As you will hear, Zuckerberg can cling closely to talking points, but he also did reveal more than he has about this annus horribilis for him and, well, the rest of us.", "While many are justifiably angry at him and at Facebook, I decided to not strafe the billionaire entrepreneur.", "I tried instead to engage him in a conversation about how he has mishandled his growing power and responsibility and what he planned to do about it.", "I think the interview gives a picture of an earnest and canny tech leader who is also grappling with the darker side of his creation.", "At one point, I asked him who was to blame and who should pay the price for the Cambridge Analytica controversy and he rightly named himself, as the person who invented Facebook.", "“Do you want me to fire myself on this podcast?” Zuckerberg joked. Spoiler alert: He did not.", "Unfortunately, we did not get to every topic. We did not touch on the important issues of diversity, tech addiction and other issues that I hope to get to discuss with him in our next interview.", "You can listen to our entire conversation right now in the audio player below. If you prefer to listen on your phone, Recode Decode is available wherever you listen to podcasts — including Apple Podcasts, Spotify, Pocket Casts and Overcast.", "What follows is a condensed, lightly edited version of the conversation. You can read a full transcript of the interview here.", "Kara Swisher: I’m gonna start off with the news of the day. You saw the Putin/Trump press conference, essentially.", "Tell me what you think about his idea that there is no evidence that the Russians used social media and did different things during the election.", "Well, the evidence that we’ve seen is quite clear, that the Russians did try to interfere with the election.", "We’ve tried to cooperate with the government and the different investigations that are going on — they obviously have much more context than this.", "But what we saw, before the election, was this Russian hacking group, part of Russian military intelligence, that I guess our government calls APT28.", "They were trying to do more traditional methods of hacking: Phishing people’s accounts, just getting access to people’s accounts that way.", "We identified this, actually, in the middle of 2015 and notified the FBI. When we saw similar activity through the campaign in 2016, that they were trying to phish people’s accounts in both the DNC and RNC, we notified some of the people over there as well, [who] we thought were at risk.", "We, around the time of the election, had given this context to the FBI. They’ve clearly gone much further now, at this point, in terms of putting the whole story together.", "You could see that in the indictments that Mueller just issued over the last week or so. That’s the part that I actually think we got, and were on top of.", "Now, there’s a whole other area of election interference that we were slower to identify. That’s around the coordinated information operations that they were trying to run, and that was a different group.", "Instead of APT28, that was this group, IRA, the Internet Research Agency, which basically was just setting up a network of fake accounts, in order to spread divisive information.", "Once we became aware of this — which we think we were too slow to being on top of that, but once we became aware of this — we developed this whole roadmap and set of techniques to go and handle that type of security threat in addition to the type of phishing and more traditional cyber attacks that we had seen before.", "That takes us through all the elections that we have seen since then. There’s the French presidential election, the German election, the Alabama special election, the Mexican election recently, and there were elections all around the world.", "Now the playbook is: We build AI tools to go find these fake accounts, find coordinated networks of inauthentic activity and take them down; we make it much harder for anyone to advertise in ways that they shouldn’t be.", "A lot of tools around ad transparency, to make it so that anyone who is advertising, especially around political issue ads, will have a lot of the information, a very high standard of transparency.", "Higher than what you have in TV or print, or other kinds of ads there.", "What took you so long? I think, as you know, many people feel disappointed with Facebook’s behavior and the slowness, given the power that you have, or the power over the market you have.", "I don’t wanna say what’s your excuse, but that’s kind of the question. What was the problem?", "We just weren’t looking for these kind of information operations. We have a big security operation. We were focused on traditional types of hacking.", "We found that and notified both the government and the people who were at risk, but there’s no doubt we were too slow to identify this new kind of attack, which was a coordinated online information operation.", "You can bet that that’s now a big focus of the security effort that we have here. We’re very focused on making sure that we get this right, not just broadly, but in all the elections that are coming up.", "2018 is an incredibly important election year, not just with the important midterms here in the U.S., but you just had the Mexican elections.", "You have Brazil. You have India coming up at the beginning of next year. There’s an assortment of elections around the EU.", "We’re very serious about this. We know that we need to get this right. We take that responsibility very seriously.", "I know you say that, but I do wanna get at, do you reflect on what it was within ‘cause you’re the leader here, you’re the head of this, that you didn’t see it?", "That you don’t see that side of humanity? Or, that you don’t understand your responsibility?", "In retrospect, I do think it’s fair to say that we were overly idealistic and focused on more of the good parts of what connecting people and giving people a voice can bring.", "I think now we understand that, given where we are, both the centrality of Facebook, but also, frankly, we’re a profitable enough company to have 20,000 people go work on reviewing content, so I think that means that we have a responsibility to go do that.", "That’s a different position than we were in five or six years ago, or even when we went public and were a meaningfully smaller company at that point.", "I do think it’s fair to say that we were probably… we were too focused on just the positives and not focused enough on some of the negatives.", "That said, I don’t want to leave the impression that we didn’t care about security or didn’t have thousands of people working on it before then.", "I think we have a lot of responsibility. The community, more than two billion people use our products, and we get that with that, a lot of people are using that for a lot of good, but we also have a responsibility to mitigate the darker things that people are gonna try to do.", "When we first met many years ago, one of the things that you did tell me that was striking was you called Facebook a utility.", "At the time you meant it was a useful system. What do you call Facebook now?", "I think that that is still a good description. In general, we’re a social network. I prefer that because I think it is focused on the people part of it — as opposed to some people call it social media, which I think focuses more on the content.", "For me, it’s always been about the people, and the reason why I called it a utility was because a lot of people used to think of it as a fad.", "What I was trying to communicate was, no, building a network and building relationships is one of the most core things that people do, and that is an enduring utility that people need, that is not a fad.", "The company shouldn’t be run to try to build something that is cool, it should be run to build something that is useful and enduring.", "When I think about what social networking should be... now you’ve mapped out all of the people who a person cares about.", "What are all the useful things that you can do for people on top of that? So I think about things like Marketplace, that we’re doing, that now people can have trust through their network and can basically go and buy and sell things more easily than they would be able to on other services.", "Other examples are things like Safety Check. There are disasters that happen — Hurricane Harvey came up, and you had people self-organizing through the community and getting in boats and driving around rescuing people coordinated ad hoc through this network.", "That’s not a media function. That’s a social network of people coming together ad hoc to provide safety infrastructure that the world needs, so that’s kind of more how I think about what we’re doing.", "This has been, everyday seems to be a new thing of people asking you to make determinations about what news is.", "The power you have over distribution is very clear — to publishers, to citizens and everyone else. How do you look at your role?", "Right now as we’re doing this interview, there’s a Congressional hearing going on. In that case, conservatives think that you don’t give a voice to conservatives.", "Yesterday, I wrote a story, which I think you read, about other publications think you give too much voice to those.", "“You shouldn’t have InfoWars on here.” Let’s talk about InfoWars. Let’s use them as the example. Make the case for keeping them, and make the case for not allowing them to be distributed by you.", "There are really two core principles at play here. There’s giving people a voice, so that people can express their opinions.", "Then, there’s keeping the community safe, which I think is really important. We’re not gonna let people plan violence or attack each other or do bad things.", "Within this, those principles have real trade-offs and real tug on each other. In this case, we feel like our responsibility is to prevent hoaxes from going viral and being widely distributed.", "The approach that we’ve taken to false news is not to say, you can’t say something wrong on the internet.", "I think that that would be too extreme. Everyone gets things wrong, and if we were taking down people’s accounts when they got a few things wrong, then that would be a hard world for giving people a voice and saying that you care about that.", "But at the same time, I think that we have a responsibility to, when you look at… if you look at the top hundred things that are going viral or getting distribution on Facebook within any given day, I do think we have a responsibility to make sure that those aren’t hoaxes and blatant misinformation.", "That’s the approach that we’ve taken. We look at the things that are getting the most distribution. If people have flag them as potential hoaxes, we send those to fact-checkers who are all well reputable and have followed standard principles for fact checking, and if those fact checkers say that it is provably false, then we will significantly reduce the distribution of that content, and if someone-", "So, you move them down the line rather than get rid of them?", "Why don’t you wanna just say “get off our platform?”", "Look, as abhorrent as some of this content can be, I do think that it gets down to this principle of giving people a voice.", "Let me give you an example of where we would take it down. In Myanmar or Sri Lanka, where there’s a history of sectarian violence, similar to the tradition in the U.S. where you can’t go into a movie theater and yell “Fire!”", "The principles that we have on what we remove from the service are: If it’s going to result in real harm, real physical harm, or if you’re attacking individuals, then that content shouldn’t be on the platform.", "There’s a lot of categories of that that we can get into, but then there’s broad debate.", "Okay. “Sandy Hook didn’t happen” is not a debate. It is false. You can’t just take that down?", "I also think that going to someone who is a victim of Sandy Hook and telling them, “Hey, no, you’re a liar” — that is harassment, and we actually will take that down.", "But overall, let’s take this whole closer to home...", "I’m Jewish, and there’s a set of people who deny that the Holocaust happened.", "I find that deeply offensive. But at the end of the day, I don’t believe that our platform should take that down because I think there are things that different people get wrong.", "I don’t think that they’re intentionally getting it wrong, but I think-", "In the case of the Holocaust deniers, they might be, but go ahead.", "It’s hard to impugn intent and to understand the intent. I just think, as abhorrent as some of those examples are, I think the reality is also that I get things wrong when I speak publicly.", "I’m sure you do. I’m sure a lot of leaders and public figures we respect do too, and I just don’t think that it is the right thing to say, “We’re going to take someone off the platform if they get things wrong, even multiple times.”", "(Update: Mark has clarified these remarks here: “I personally find Holocaust denial deeply offensive, and I absolutely didn’t intend to defend the intent of people who deny that.”)", "What we will do is we’ll say, “Okay, you have your page, and if you’re not trying to organize harm against someone, or attacking someone, then you can put up that content on your page, even if people might disagree with it or find it offensive.”", "But that doesn’t mean that we have a responsibility to make it widely distributed in News Feed. I think we, actually, to the contrary-", "So you move them down? Versus, in Myanmar, where you remove it?", "Can I ask you that, specifically about Myanmar? How did you feel about those killings and the blame that some people put on Facebook?", "I think that we have a responsibility to be doing more there.", "Yes, I think that there’s a terrible situation where there’s underlying sectarian violence and intention.", "It is clearly the responsibility of all of the players who were involved there. So, the government, civil society, the different folks who were involved, and I think that we have an important role, given the platform, that we play, so we need to make sure that we do what we need to.", "We’ve significantly ramped up the investment in people who speak Burmese. It’s often hard, from where we sit, to identify who are the figures who are promoting hate and what is going to... which is the content that is going to incite violence?", "So it’s important that we build relationships with civil society and folks there who can help us identify that.", "I want make sure that our products are used for good. At the end of the day, other people blaming us or not is actually not the thing that matters to me.", "It’s not that every single thing that happens on Facebook is gonna be good. This is humanity. People use tools for good and bad, but I think that we have a clear responsibility to make sure that the good is amplified and to do everything we can to mitigate the bad.", "Let me give you another example. When Live came up, one of the terrible use cases where people were using ...", "There were a small number of uses of this, but people were using it to ... show themselves [doing] self-harm, or there were even a few cases of suicide.", "We looked at this, we’re like, “This is terrible. This is not what we want the product to be. This is terrible, and if this is happening and we can help prevent it, then we have a responsibility to.”", "So, what did we do? We took the time to build AI tools and to hire a team of 3,000 people to be able to respond to those live videos within 10 minutes.", "Most content on Facebook, we try to get to within hours or within a day, if it comes up, and obviously, if someone’s gonna harm themselves, you don’t have a day or hours.", "You have to get to that quickly. With all the millions of videos that are posted, we had to build this combination of an AI system that could flag content that our reviewers should look at, and then hire a specific team trained and dedicated to that, so that way they could review all the things very quickly and have a very low latency.", "In the last six months, we’ve been able to help first responders get to more than a thousand people who needed help quickly because of that effort.", "I want to finish up on news by talking about sort of what’s going on today with conservatives versus liberals.", "Why won’t you make choices there, or do you feel like you just don’t want to make any, in terms of media and what should be ...", "How do you respond when conservatives say, “You don’t have enough conservative stuff on the platform?”", "You guys have responded and some people think you over-responded. How do you think you’ve done?", "Well, I think it gets back to the core principles: Giving people a voice on the one hand, and keeping the community and people safe on the other hand.", "Our bias tends to be to want to give people a voice and let people express a wide range of opinions. I don’t think that’s a liberal or conservative thing; those are the words in the U.S.", "What are your political leanings? Do you have them?", "I care about specific issues very deeply and I’m not sure that aligns with any kind of specific thing.", "So I mean, I’m very outspoken on immigration reform. In 2013, I helped start with a number of entrepreneurs FWD.us, which is a group working on immigration reform that I think recognizes that we need to secure the border and enforce laws, but that also understands that the benefits of immigration, both to the country and the economy and as a humane civil rights issue for the 11 million people who are undocumented here, is incredibly important.", "How did you feel about the border separations as a citizen?", "What did you do? Did you do anything besides donate money or stuff like ...", "Yeah, well I mean, the good news here is because we’ve been working on FWD for so long, it has established a lot of the infrastructure that now ...", "When a crisis comes up, you can’t just spin this stuff up immediately. So they’re in there and they’re able to help out.", "But I mean, talking about social utility, one of the really proud moments recently of working at this company was the fact that a couple of people could-", "The Willners. I had them on the podcast. Yeah, they’re great.", "... start a fundraiser to raise $1500, enough to bail one person out, and they ended up raising more than $20 million.", "And this thing just went viral, and I think it’s a great example of when you give people a voice what positive things can happen, both substantively in terms of the fundraiser and just the widespread show of support, I think, is also really meaningful.", "And I think a combination of that and a number of other things like that may have been what led the administration to backtrack on the policy there.", "So let’s get into the idea of privacy and data. How do you assess your performance in front of Congress?", "It was a low bar, Mark; they didn’t do a very good job. That’s my opinion.", "I thought you did, but I only thought it’s because they did such a bad job.", "Well look, I think a lot of people think about this from a gamesmanship perspective of like, someone’s winning and someone’s losing.", "I’m there as a witness who hopefully understands some relevant context on an issue of importance to the nation, and I view my responsibility as making sure that they can get as much information as they need to in order to inform what they need to go do.", "Like you saw with the Mueller indictments recently, I think some of that context probably initially came from us, but then they had to go build on that for years in terms of putting together the whole story and do very significant work on top of that.", "But if we can help out in ways like that, then I feel good about our contribution.", "Okay. Back to the hearings, one of the things I think ... I’m not saying it’s a win/lose thing; I think they did not press you very hard on certain issues.", "One is what you guys do with the data; one was the part related to Cambridge Analytica, which is what happened there, which I think is still ...", "You’re still investigating, it’s still being investigated by authorities in how it happened. And in that case, your defense was, “We didn’t see it, but once we saw it, we did something about it.”", "What I would’ve asked is, “Why didn’t you see it?” What’s the problem in that with this data that you did not see it being misused?", "Because I was at your 2009 or 2008 ... I remember when you were talking about this idea.", "Yeah, so the principles at play here are, on the one hand, you want people to have control over their information and be able to bring it out of Facebook to other different apps, because we’re not going to build all of the social experiences and it should be easy for people to use their data anywhere.", "But on the other hand, if they have that information in Facebook and the developer has some relationship with us, then we also have a responsibility to protect people and keep people safe.", "And what happened here was a developer built a quiz app, and then they turned around and sold the data that people gave them to someone else.", "And that is clearly against all of the policies that we have. I mean, that’s terrible, right? We don’t sell data, we don’t allow anyone to sell data.", "Because it was on their servers, we don’t necessarily see that transaction or whatever they’re doing.", "But you have, in the past, caught people doing this and been much more rigorous in that.", "We do a number of things. One is, we do ongoing audits and we have built technical systems to see if a developer is requesting information in weird ways.", "We do spot checks where we can audit developers’ servers. But a lot of the stuff comes from flags that either people in the community or law enforcement or different folks send us, and that was actually similar here too.", "I think it was The Guardian who initially pointed out to us, “Hey, we think that this developer, Alexander Kogan, has sold information.”", "And when we learned about that, we immediately shut down the app, took away his profile, and demanded certification that the data was deleted.", "Now the thing that I think, in retrospect, that we really messed up here is that we believed the certification.", "Now normally, I don’t know about you, but when someone writes a legal certification, my inclination is to believe that.", "There’s an expression in journalism, “If your mother says she loves you, check it.” But go ahead.", "All right, that’s fair. I tend to have more faith in the rule of law, but-", "And I think the links between Peter [Thiel] on your board and [Steve] Bannon and ... It creates a really bad situation for you all, or suspect.", "It at least leads to people wondering what was happening there. Easily.", "All right. Well I don’t think that there’s any suggestion that that stuff was connected here, but I do think-", "No, but I’m just saying. It just creates a, “What the heck was going on here?”", "Yeah. I think in retrospect ... You know, we didn’t know what Cambridge Analytica was there, it didn’t strike us as a sketchy thing.", "We just had no history with them. Knowing what I know now, we obviously would not have just taken their certification at its word and would’ve gone in and done an audit then.", "Now our policy is, we are not just going to take developers at their word when they say that they aren’t misusing information; we’re going to go and audit every single developer who had a large amount of access to people’s information before we significantly lock down the amount of access that developers could get starting back in 2014.", "I asked Sheryl this, so I’m just curious what you think.", "Well, I think it’s a big issue. But look, I designed the platform, so if someone’s going to get fired for this, it should be me.", "And I think that the important thing going forward is to make sure that we get this right. In this case, the most important steps, in terms of, to prevent this from happening again, we’d already taken in 2014 when we had changed dramatically the way that the platform worked.", "But overall, I mean, this is an important situation, and I think again it’s ... This to me is an example of, you get judged by how you deal with an issue when it comes up.", "And I think on this one, we’ve done the right things, and many of them I think we’d actually done years ago to prevent this kind of situation from happening again.", "But to be clear, you’re not gonna fire yourself right now? Is that right?", "Okay, all right. Well that would be fantastic. I mean, I think you’ll do okay.", "So let’s get to the privacy and data part of it. One of the things you kept saying in Congress, which really drove me crazy because you said it like ...", "Yeah, why not? Whatever, Mark. Whatever works for you. No.", "I think we should do what’s gonna be right for the community.", "All right, okay. All right. Well I’ll get to regulation in a second, but two more sections and then you’ll be out of here.", "One is, you kept saying, “Senator, we don’t sell your data. Senator, we don’t sell your data.” You kind of sell people’s data in a different way by marrying it with other data, you sell insights into that data, you sell ...", "Your whole business is predicated on using data to make money. Why did you keep saying that? I mean technically, you’re correct, but ...", "Yes, I know, but you don’t technically sell your data, but you use their data to sell advertising. So you are in essence ...", "What are you doing with people’s data? How would you describe it?", "Well look, it bothers me when reputable news outlets make claims like saying that we sell data because it is just-", "We don’t sell data. Now, I understand what you’re saying, that the business model works basically in two ways; one is people have attention from being on the service, which is no different from the ads you’ll run during this podcast or traditional TV ads for the last 50 years.", "But there is an element of targeting which is that, because we understand what you’re interested in, we can show you more relevant ads to you.", "And people, overall, people want to know that their information is secure, and that if they give it to you, they want you to use it to make their experience good, but they don’t want you to give it to other people.", "So while it may seem like a small difference to you, this distinction on “selling data,” I actually think to people it’s like the whole game, right?", "So we don’t sell data, we don’t give the data to anyone else, but overwhelmingly people do tell us that if they’re going to see ads on Facebook, they want the ads to be relevant; they don’t want bad ads.", "Do you think people understand how much information you have on them? It’s a different factor that ever before in history, how much information you know about people.", "Maybe. Although I think most people actually, on a service like Facebook or Instagram, probably have a greater awareness of the information that’s there than on a lot of other services, because in our case, you actually put it there, right?", "You told us that you like that thing, or you posted that photo, or said that. So I actually think people generally have an awareness and feel like, “Wow, these networks have a lot of information.”", "The areas that I would actually worry about more for consumers are places where they don’t realize that services are collecting a lot of information about them, but actually are.", "Regulation, how much do you think is coming from if the Democrats get back in power? They’ve gotten rather hostile towards you and Google, it seems.", "Okay, across the world. Do you see regulation being … Obviously, Europe is a place where there’s much more regulation happening and more activity.", "The area that I think is most likely is content. So the U.S. has a very rich tradition of free speech; it is written into the Constitution, free speech, so here, we have a very strong allergic reaction to trying to regulate that.", "But in almost every other country in the world, while people generally want as much expression as possible, there’s some notion that something else might be more important than speech; so preventing hate or-", "... terrorism or just different things. So you’re already starting to see this; I mean, there was the hate speech law in Germany.", "I think that there will be additional laws creating responsibility for social networking, and social companies, and Internet companies overall to be more proactive in policing terrorism, or bullying, or hate speech, or different kinds of content.", "And overall, I think that there are good and bad ways to do that, but my general take is that a lot of that stuff can be pretty reasonable.", "I mean, I think we’re not kids in a dorm room anymore, right?", "We’re at a point now where we’ve built AI tools to detect when terrorists are trying to spread content, and 99 percent of the terrorist content that we take down, our systems flag before any human sees them or flags them for us.", "And we can afford, at this point, to have 20,000 people reviewing the content.", "So I think the point where you have that kind of AI technology and you have the resources to be able to employ people to do that kind of content review, I kinda think you have a responsibility to do it.", "Okay. So you can handle regulation. What about the call ... There’s been some calls to break up some companies like Facebook or Amazon that become too big.", "You know, I think that there’s ... It’s a very interesting debate overall. If you actually get down to why we’re big, it’s not ...", "In the traditional sense, we’re not big because we’re so big in the United States, although we are and a lot of people use our products here.", "If we weren’t an international company, if you said, “Okay, you have to shut down all of your services outside of the U.S.,” we actually would not be very profitable at all; we actually would probably be unprofitable.", "So I think you have this question from a policy perspective, which is, do we want American companies to be exporting across the world?", "We grew up here, I think we share a lot of values that I think people hold very dear here, and I think it’s generally very good that we’re doing this, both for security reasons and from a values perspective.", "Because I think that the alternative, frankly, is going to be the Chinese companies. If we adopt a stance which is that, “Okay, we’re gonna, as a country, decide that we wanna clip the wings of these companies and make it so that it’s harder for them to operate in different places, where they have to be smaller,” then there are plenty of other companies out that are willing and able to take the place of the work that we’re doing.", "Yeah. And they do not share the values that we have. I think you can bet that if the government hears word that it’s election interference or terrorism, I don’t think Chinese companies are going to wanna cooperate as much and try to aid the national interest there.", "And are you working on moving Facebook products in there?", "Over the long term. I think it’s hard to have a mission of wanting to bring the whole world closer together and leave out the biggest country.", "I mean, we’re, I think, a long time away from doing anything.", "At some point, I think that we need to figure it out, but we need to figure out a solution that is in line with our principles and what we want to do, and in line with the laws there, or else it’s not going to happen.", "All right. I wanna finish up just talking about you. This is an issue I’ve talked about a lot is Silicon Valley responsibility, and taking responsibility.", "And taking responsibility of your dark things, and not being quite as optimistic, and a lot of people here have a problem with looking at that.", "How do you look at your responsibility, as a leader? As a leader of a massive company with enormous power?", "Do you think you grok that at this point? Sometimes I don’t think you do. I really don’t.", "Well, I think we have a responsibility to build the things that give people a voice and help people connect and help people build community, which ultimately is the unique thing that we do in the world.", "But then on the other hand, I think we also have a responsibility to recognize that the tools won’t always be used for good things and we need to be there and be ready to mitigate all the negative uses, so whether that’s terrorism, or people thinking about self-harm or suicide who we need to go make sure they get help quickly, or bullying, or election interference, or fake news.", "The list goes on, and there’s a lot of these things. There are very specific pieces of work that we have to do on each.", "I mean, just take terrorism for example. We have a team of more than 200 people working on counterterrorism.", "I mean, that’s pretty intense. That’s not like what people think about what Facebook is.", "No, I’m sure when you were an engineer you weren’t thinking this was your ...", "I do think that there will be things that we get wrong in the future, too, but I think to say that we don’t care about what’s going on, or mitigating any of the downsides of what people do, I don’t think is right.", "I think to say that that is the only thing that we should be focused on, I think also is not quite right because I think that what most people out there want is the ability to stay connected with the people that they love, and to be able to join communities because that’s an important part of people’s lives.", "If we’re not making progress on that and advancing the ball forward there too, then I also don’t think we’re doing our job.", "What about the image of Facebook? It’s not great right now. Would you agree with that?", "I mean, personally, my take on this is that for the last 10 or 15 years, we have gotten mostly glowing and adoring attention from people, and if people wanna focus on some real issues for a couple of years, I’m fine with it.", "Frankly, I think that the news industry is critically important because it points out things and surfaces truths that can often be uncomfortable.", "I think that that’s working, and the spotlight has been pointed on things that we have a responsibility to do better, and I accept that.", "While it may not be the most fun period of running the company, I think we take the responsibility really seriously and get that in the grand scheme of things, I don’t think people are being unfair to us.", "I think people have been very positive and are focused on all the good that come with the technology for a long period of time.", "To have a period where people focus on some of the negative uses, to make sure that we fully understand that, I think is completely reasonable.", "If there’s going to be a period of two years where we frankly didn’t handle a bunch of things as well as we should’ve and need to get back on top of it, then I mean, you’re not going to cry about that.", "What’s your goal this year? You have these goals. This year is fix Facebook. You did the Visit Every Cow In America Tour last year.", "What is your personal goal this year? Away from fixing Facebook?", "I mean, I think that the feeling this year is that ... I’ve done these personal challenges because I think running a company can be an all-consuming thing.", "I think in order to have a broader perspective, you wanna do things outside of that too. Whether that’s running, or learning Mandarin, or visiting different places, or coding an AI to run my home, I think that those are all good things.", "But this year, I think we have a number of issues that we need to deal with and it didn’t feel right to me to focus on something else outside.", "I think that this is, and interesting enough, this is an important challenge that I think we need to dedicate every fiber of what we’re doing to making sure that we get this right.", "I think it’ll take about three years to fully retool everything at Facebook to be on top of all the content issues and security issues.", "But the good news is we’re about a year and a half in. I do think that by the end of this year, we’ll have significantly turned the corner on a lot of these issues.", "I don’t think we’re gonna be as good as we would like to next year, either, but I think it’ll be close.", "Do you have any political goals? I know people thought when you did your grand tour of the United States that was what you were doing with your team of videographers, et cetera.", "I mean, I care about helping to address these problems of social cohesion and understanding what economic problems people think exist.", "I tend to think that we all get support from three basic places: Our friends and family, the communities we’re a part of, and then, ultimately, the government with its safety net.", "I think as a society, we spend the vast majority of our time talking about what the government should do in the political debates.", "I think we spend not enough time talking about how important community is. So you go around... I mean I saw, sit with ministers in places, and they talk about", "not just the religious role that they play as a religious organization, but as a community organization.", "One minister told me that he knew that when a factory closed down in town, he was gonna be seeing more couples for couples counseling a few weeks later because of the tension.", "All right. That’s a real piece of social infrastructure that needs to exist.", "If people aren’t a part of those kind of organizations, then there’s a core need that people have that is not being fulfilled.", "I sat down with kids in Chicago, a school where a lot of kids were in gangs. I mean, they told me the reason why people were in gangs is not because they wanted to be in a gang, they understood that it was dangerous, but because they needed a sense of community, and in a dangerous environment, they wanted to know that someone was looking after them.", "Who do you look up to? Do you look up to other internet people? Elon Musk, Jeff Bezos, or is it there’s like an ultra male competition between and among you?", "Well, I think that there are a couple. Bill Gates has always been a mentor and inspiration for me even before I knew him.", "Just growing up, I admired how Microsoft was mission-focused. It was a company that had a clear social goal, or that it wanted to make ...", "They thought that computers were gonna be valuable, and having that become ubiquitous. It was like an Apollo-like goal to me that always struck me as really nice.", "Then, I think his second act of going and being one of the world’s best philanthropists has absolutely influenced me.", "Not only to try to follow in his footsteps and do something hopefully one day that will be as impactful as what he has done, but his lesson there that you have to start early to practice.", "Like anything that you want to get good at, you don’t just show up and effectively and efficiently give money away.", "The notion that if I want be really good at this 10 or 15 years from now, then Priscilla and I really need to be starting to work on this now.", "He has had, he and Melinda, and Melinda has increasingly really been a role model for us as well, just have really deeply influenced the way that I think about both work and philanthropy.", "But one of the things that I’d say that I’m really lucky is that a lot of the people who I look up to the most, I get to work with every day.", "I mean, I think Sheryl is amazing. A lot of what I know about business and building organizations and leadership come from working with her.", "A lot of the other folks who I get to work with every day, Chris Cox is just an amazing person. I always tell people that you should only hire people to be on your team if you would work for them.", "But in an alternate universe, I would be honored to work for any of these people. I think that that is, I don’t know, that is greater gift than having some external mentors who I get to talk to once a quarter.", "Okay. My very last question. Very briefly, what do you think the most exciting product area is right now?", "Longer term, as a technologist, one of things that just excites me is there are always new computing platforms.", "Every 10 or 15 years a new one comes along. They’re always more native, they capture your human experience more.", "Immersively, you share more naturally what you’re experiencing. I just think that VR and AR are going to be a really big deal.", "You can just see this trajectory from early internet, when the technology and connections were slow, most of the internet was text.", "Text is great, but it can be sometimes hard to capture what’s going on. Then, we all got phones with cameras on them and the internet got good enough to be primarily images.", "Now the networks are getting good enough that it’s primarily video. At each step along the way, we’re able to capture the human experience with greater fidelity and richness, and I think that that’s great.", "Now, I do think that we’re gonna move towards this world where eventually you’ll be able to capture a whole experience that you’re in and be able to send that to someone.", "I think that that’s just gonna be an amazing technology for perspective taking and putting yourself in other people’s shoes, for being able to feeling like you’re really physically there with someone even when you’re not.", "One of the criticisms of technology today is you’re sitting and looking at your phone, and we could be sitting together but we’re actually fragmented.", "No, I agree with you on VR. I’ve just been doing some recent VR stuff that’s really promising.", "Yeah. I mean, there’s a few technology leaps that still need to be made, but the initial use is amazing.", "I’m not sure you an give people empathy though. You can see people, the world through people’s eyes, but you can’t understand their experience, necessarily.", "Yes. Although, I think there’s also an economic ... We’ve talked a lot about the social aspects of all of this, but I think one of the biggest issues economically today is that opportunity isn’t evenly distributed.", "You get all these people have to move to cities, and then the cities get to be way too expensive, and if you have a technology like VR where you can be present anywhere but live where you choose to, then I think that that can be really profound.", "There’re really only a few solutions to this. Historically, cities have grown to be bigger by building better physical infrastructure.", "There’ll be some amount of that. I mean, I think things like hyperloops and things like that can extend the suburbs, could be quite interesting, but I have to believe that, we’re here in 2018, it’s much cheaper and easier to move bits around than it is atoms.", "It strikes me that something like VR or AR, or even video conferencing on the path to that, has to be a more likely part of the solution than just building a ton of physical infrastructure.", "All right. Now you have one chance. What would you like to say to your giant nation state of Facebook right now?", "I know. but what’s the one thing they’re getting wrong about you right now? I’m gonna give you a nice out.", "That’s tough. It’s always hard to say what is the one thing. I don’t know. I think that the main thing that I’ve tried to internalize this year is we get that there’s a big responsibility and a lot of things that we need to do better than we are.", "We are working on it, and I think a lot of them, we’re doing better already, and for the rest, we’re committed to getting to where we need to be for the community.", "At the same time, we also feel a responsibility to keep on moving forward on giving people tools to share their experience and connect and come together in new ways.", "Ultimately, that’s the unique thing that Facebook was put on this Earth to do. I think if we don’t push forward on that, we will be missing our responsibility for advancing the ball there.", "That’s what I care about, and we’re just very serious about making sure that we do both of those things."]}

Or is there something that looks compared to status quo today, you know, so much better again that it’s sort of like a status quo before the Industrial Revolution.", "And as you look around the world today, on the one hand, we see the tremendous importance of the progress that we are generating and that for example the number of people in extreme poverty has declined by more than a billion people since I was born.", "But on the other hand, there’s a lot of suggestive evidence that maybe we aren’t as effective at generating progress today as we have been in the past.", "So for example, if you look at the U.S., productivity growth mid-century or say between, you know, 1920, 1970, was maybe about 1.9% a year.", "Now most economists think it’s much lower, maybe around sort of .4% a year, something like that. So we’re at least by economic measures, generating progress more slowly than we used to be.", "Now, whatever the rate at which we’re kind of making progress or figuring out ways to do things better today, whatever that absolute level is, it would be much better if we were doing it more effectively, if we were able to solve the most important problems that face us today in 50 years and 100 years rather than 500 years or a thousand years, right?", "So the meta question we’re really interested in is how does progress happen, how do we discover useful knowledge, how is that diffused, and how can we do it better?", "TYLER COWEN: It’s important to understand, I think, how much this is an invisible crisis. So if you have a growth rate that is 1 percentage point lower, over the course of a bit more than a century, you could have been three times richer with a higher growth rate.", "That would be something like the difference between the United States today and Mexico. So by having a lower rate of productivity growth, in no given year does it feel that bad, but two, three generations later, you’re much worse off, it’s harder to pay off your debts, harder to solve climate change, harder to address a whole host of problems.", "ZUCKERBERG: Yeah, so before we kinda dive into how we can improve this, what do you say to the people who question whether all this progress is positive?", "I mean, certainly as we make progress in one area, it creates issues in other areas, and that’s been a big topic that I focused on in my work at Facebook over the last few years and a lot of these challenge discussions.", "But how does that fit into the overall framework of what you’re studying and this discipline here?", "COWEN: I don’t think economic growth is always a positive, but the world and America has serious problems.", "I would rather address those problems with more resources rather than fewer, whether it is paying off our debts, addressing climate change, fixing global poverty.", "And knowledge matters too. So there’s a recent paper by Ester Duflo and Abhijit Banerjee and they find if you give foreign aid combined with coaching, the rate of return to that intervention is maybe 100 to 400%.", "And that may or may not be true, but what I would like to see is a world where everyone is obsessing over that claim, over that debate, working very hard to figure out that it’s true, that should be on the front page.", "People should be talking about it, calling up their siblings: “My goodness, I just read this, what are we gonna do?", "COLLISON: Yeah, and look, while again, I think it’s unequivocally the case that sort of certain kinds of progress in certain places to a certain extent can have harms and externalities and all the rest, and a really important part of progress is figuring out how do we mitigate those, how do we solve them and so on — I think climate change is probably kind of the foremost global example today.", "But I think it’s really important — or it is easy for us sitting here in the Bay Area in California to undervalue the prosperity and the kind of wealth we’ve been able to generate over the past couple hundred years.", "Since I was born, for example, global life expectancy has increased by about six years, and infant mortality has fallen by more than 50%.", "Again, I mentioned the statistic of the number of people who have left extreme poverty. This is incredibly important, right?", "And so I think there’s — we’re not the first people to say it, but there is a moral imperative to this kind of progress, and we shouldn’t lose sight of that fact.", "ZUCKERBERG: Yeah, I agree. I just think it’s important to acknowledge that a lot of these things are not uniform and you know from running a company that when you look at averages it hides a lot of issues.", "Your example on the rates of poverty going down I think is an interesting one in this because what a lot of people don’t particularly wanna talk about these days is that most of the benefit of people coming out of poverty has happened in China, and in some places in the world poverty has actually increased.", "So I generally agree with the premise — and I think studying this stuff will generally help us to make more progress in those places.", "I mean, that may be a good example because perhaps looking at some of the examples of what has done well in China could be applied to other places where there have been issues.", "But before we dive into the discussion on this, I just wanted to make sure that we didn’t cover this is a way that comes across as if every step forward comes without a cost.", "And I’m sure as we talk through the different examples, I mean, that’ll come up as well.", "COLLISON: Yeah, and we should emphasize that, you know, when we sort of talk about the phenomenon of “progress,” you know, I think GDP or GDP per capita is a pretty good first approximation measure of it and it correlates strongly with many of the things we care about.", "But they’re definitely not the same thing. I think an important question for anybody interested in this area to think about is, well, how should we define progress?", "And what are the better and worse kinds of it. Again, in GDP, we have a relatively effective metric we can use across countries, but there already is interesting work on what might better measures be, and I think that’s really important to study.", "COWEN: Well, let’s say you want to improve the lot of people in West Virginia. One growth-enhancing way of doing that is to make it easier to build, say, in Washington D.C. and the Bay Area.", "Right now, to move from West Virginia, say, to Menlo Park, it’s extraordinarily expensive. You can’t just pick up and show up here and hope to get a job washing dishes the way one might have done in America 50 years ago.", "So by having more building, more economic growth, also more GDP, it would increase more opportunity. So economic growth and opportunity — they do tend to be correlated, and sometimes the problem is we don’t have enough growth, not that we have too much.", "COLLISON: And look, not to hammer this point too strongly, but, you know, you did invite the two people who wrote the piece for our progress here —", "ZUCKERBERG: Yeah, and I wanna spend most of the time actually talking about that. I just wanted to make sure that we hit that up front.", "So there are a lot of people who already are studying this in different ways, right? They’re historians, economists.", "When you’re thinking about what the field is, when you’re talking about trying to create a new science of studying progress, what more do you think needs to get done, or what do you envision on that?", "I mean, I know you have a fund that you’ve put together, Emergent Ventures. And where you’re basically finding academics who are studying examples of where there’s progress in the past to start this field.", "But what does this add up to? What form does this take over time?", "COWEN: One view of mine is that not enough philanthropy is long-term oriented. In this regard, I’ve been influenced by your Chan Zuckerberg Initiative.", "And also in philanthropy, there are too many choke points that can say no, so foundations become their own bureaucracies.", "So Emergent Ventures is a new kind of philanthropy. There’s one layer of yes or no. People are encouraged to apply.", "If the payoff is 30, 40 years down the road, the attitude is, “Great.” Take a lot of chances. Worry about getting some winners and some risk and not expect the median project to be something that necessarily looks good when taken to a board.", "So that’s one way that thinking in terms of progress helps us restructure at the micro level the particular decisions we’re making.", "COLLISON: I strongly agree that sort of there’s a lot of important work already happening across multiple disciplines that is relevant to these questions.", "Like the idea of there being “a new science of progress” — that was the headline placed on the article but not exactly what we’re saying.", "What we’re arguing is that the work that’s already happening should be receiving more attention and there should be much more of us.", "And just to give a couple of quick examples: there’s strongly suggested evidence that we can teach management practices so people can run firms more effectively, right?", "So there’s a couple of studies on this. There’s a good one from some folks at Stanford that did a randomized trial in India.", "And there’s a really neat one that came out last year from Michela Giorcelli looking at firms in Italy and showing that over 15 years after a management training program with some natural randomization, that those firms were employing more people, paying more wages, being more successful.", "And another randomized trial in Mexico conducted over the past couple years, again, 600 firms, ensuring that just teaching better management practices actually makes those companies much better off.", "If that’s true, that’s amazing low-hanging fruit, right? We should be investing much more in this area.", "We should be figuring out which kinds of management training work better or worse than others, is this generalized to all countries, how can we actually implement and execute this in the world more broadly?", "Second is, Tyler mentioned this point about geographic mobility, right? When you think about how do we grow GDP or how do we generate progress maybe housing policy’s not the first thing we’re naturally drawn to thinking about.", "However, if you look at the USA in 1980, 40% of people moved somewhere else when they took a new job.", "So those things went together much more. If you look last year, about one in ten people moved when they took a new job, right?", "So within the U.S., geographic mobility really declined. That is in large part because the costs of movement have enormously increased as housing costs have increased especially in our most productive regions over the past couple decades.", "Now if you look into that sort of more closely, there are economists who’ve been studying these questions quite closely for the past couple of years.", "These two guys Hsieh and Moretti published an updated version of a previous paper this summer putting forward a model showing that if you look at the zoning restrictions that existed in the Bay Area and New York between 1964 and 2009, and you imagine a counter-factual world where there was much more supply elasticity in these places and we built way more homes here in the Bay Area and in New York.", "In that counter-factual world, average U.S. income would be, in their model, $3,700 higher per person .", "Again, not just for people in those places, but across the country, right? That’s a huge effect size.", "And so again, we should be studying these questions much more closely and we should be figuring out, okay, well, if that’s true, what are the policy prescriptions?", "How do we actually go act upon that? It’s amazing low-hanging fruit.", "And then to give a third one, as those two examples show, funding science is incredibly important. But there’s surprisingly little work about how we should be funding science and how could we do that most effectively?", "And actually, beneath the surface, it’s been changing a tremendous amount here in the U.S. over the past couple of decades, and whether that’s a good thing is an important policy question.", "So for example, in 1980 the NIH spent 12x more dollars on researchers under 40 than researchers over 50.", "So they predominately funded younger people. Today they spend 5x more dollars on people over 50 than under 40.", "And so it’s really inverted — it’s kind of gone from primarily funding these young investigators to this gerontocracy where they’re funding older scientists.", "Maybe that’s good, maybe that’s bad, I don’t know — but that seems like a very important question to answer.", "And so part of our point in arguing for progress studies is when you really look at kind of the expansive version of all the different things that can sort of, you know, influence our ability to discover new useful knowledge to generate economic growth, the set of questions is super-broad, and we should be trying to kind of synthesize this effectively.", "ZUCKERBERG: Yeah. So let’s go deep on medical research here for a second, because this is an area that you wrote this paper about before about how the progress in the field might be slowing.", "And like you mentioned, The Chan Zuckerberg Initiative, the philanthropy that I run with my wife, a big focus of it is on medical research and trying to — we have this aspirational goal that we wanna help build tools that can help scientists cure, prevent, or manage all diseases by the end of this century.", "And basically, the math of how you get there is, starting about 100 years ago there was really this uptick in medical research where we started doing randomized control experiments, treating it more like an experimental science.", "Since around that time, the average life expectancy has increased by a quarter of a year every year, relatively linearly.", "There’s no guarantee, of course, that that continues, but if we’re able to have that continue, then that would imply that by the end of the century we will generally have had to have either cured, prevented, or been able to manage most if not all of the diseases that we’re aware of now.", "So there’s some trend that suggests that this should be reasonable, and the approach that we’re taking in the work at CZI is largely about building tools to help compound the rate of science.", "And what we see is that, like you mentioned, the government is the largest and most important funder of science and it basically funds the whole establishment of scientists across the country.", "But the grants tend to be very spread out across a lot of people. They’re not typically put into big infrastructure projects.", "And that’s the niche that we felt through CZI that we can help to fill: instead of investing a million dollars in a lab, put $100 million or a couple hundred million dollars over time into building up really important scientific assets for the community.", "Like helping to fund scientists to go put together this Human Cell Atlas. Think about it as like the periodic table of elements but for biology — all the different kinds of cells in the human body.", "And the goal is just, if you look throughout the history of science, at least, most major scientific breakthroughs have been preceded by the invention of new tools that help people look at things in different ways.", "And so the theory is similar to what you’re going at of how you increase the compounding rate of progress.", "There are a couple of different directions that I think we could go in here. One is that I’m curious what you’ve seen in your studies in the space that suggest to you that the rate of progress is actually slowing.", "And I’m also curious about the examples you’ve seen overall of how the science around studying progress would potentially lead to a different approach or a different portfolio of how this kind of work gets done.", "So I don’t know where you want to start with that, but there’s a lot here to do.", "COWEN: Here’s what worries me, and it should worry you too. So as you mentioned, U.S. life expectancy is basically going up in linear fashion.", "But if you look at expenditures, we used to spend a few percentage points of GDP on healthcare, and now it’s about 18%.", "So we’ve gone up to 18%, and we’re not even boosting the rate. I’m not saying it’s the fault of any one group of people, but something has gone wrong.", "There’s some kind of last-mile problem. You can turn to the newspapers and read all kinds of fantastic stories — new research, new ideas, new tools — but when the rubber hits the road, people living longer, we’re spending more and more and more for exactly the same returns.", "So if that trend continues — and you see a similar trend in many areas: crop yields, feeding the world, other areas — the question becomes, where does all the progress go?", "So the idea that you need to look at each structure and encourage more risk-taking, better decisions with the money, less bureaucratization — maybe in some cases more centralization, whatever it takes — but that there is this invisible crisis, and people are distracted by the headlines about CRISPR or whatever.", "But actually what you get for the money — performance is so-so, I think.", "COLLISON: Yeah, and so what we wrote in this article a year ago about what’s going on in science — if you look at it by the most kind of microscopic measures, like the number of PhDs in the U.S, —actually if you take all the microscopic measures, they all have grown by about a factor between 50 and 100.", "Number of PhDs, number of papers published every year, actual dollars into the science funding, and so on.", "So in a very stylized way, if you look at the first half of the twentieth century as compared to the second half, there’s way more input in the second half of the century.", "And again, not by 50%, but by orders of magnitude. And so then I think the question for all of us would be, well, in which half of the century did we get more out in terms of useful scientific knowledge?", "And then whichever we think did better, to what degree? And again, this is a very difficult question to answer of how do you weigh scientific knowledge?", "And so you have to look at it, I think, into various applied contexts. Like life expectancy or semiconductors or, as Tyler mentioned, crop yields or whatever.", "And I think what’s interesting and, anyway should be concerning, is that for almost every conceivable applied measure we seem to be getting at best constant returns.", "But that’s really bad because we see exponentially increasing inputs and constant return outputs. That is almost by definition not a process that we can sustain.", "Now, there’s two broad possibilities there. One is it’s just getting intrinsically harder to generate progress and to discover these things.", "And who knows, maybe some significant part of that is true. But the other possibility is it’s somehow more institutional, right?", "It’s more contingent, it’s more sociological. And again, we do have suggestive evidence that our institutions are — well, they’re certainly older than they used to be, and as in the NIH funding example, there are changes happening beneath the surface and so on that may or may not be good.", "So I don’t think we should write off the possibility that it’s not inevitable, and that there do exist alternate forms of organization where things would work better.", "And again, if we dig a little bit into the evidence there, you see things like — there’s a science funding program that, obviously, you’re familiar with called HHMI at the Howard Hughes Medical Institute.", "They give grants along the lines of how CCI does where they’re longer term, they’re more open-ended and so on.", "Pierre Azoulay at MIT wrote a paper a couple years ago in trying to look at, well, if you take ostensibly identical scientists, some of whom receive HHMI grants, and some of whom don’t, how much more successful are the HHMI recipients?", "And he concluded they’re about twice as likely to produce a top 1% paper by citation count. Again, that’s really suggestive.", "COLLISON: They’re about twice as likely to produce a top 1% paper by citation count.", "ZUCKERBERG: Well, that might be correlation, not causation.", "COLLISON: Yeah, yeah, yeah. So he tries to control for that and use a reasonable methodology for it, but some of it could totally be that just a selection effect.", "But again, I think it’s very suggestive that maybe there are things we could do that would better enable this discovery.", "And, this might seem like a bit of a red herring, but I think it is suggestive that in many other domains where we can objectively assess progress, it’s very clear that our productivity has fallen off a cliff and for reasons that we can be pretty sure are not that it’s getting intrinsically harder.", "And so, for example, when New York decided to build the subway in 1900: 4.7 years later, they opened 23 subway stations, and in 2019 dollars, they spent just over a billion dollars doing so.", "So 23 stations, just over a billion dollars. When New York decided to build the Second Avenue subway in the year 2000, 17 years later they opened three stations and they spent $4.5 billion doing so.", "And so our productivity in subway construction has, at least in New York, decreased by a factor of 40.", "Here in the Bay Area, we decide to build the Golden Gate Bridge and the Bay Bridge starting in 1933. Both projects finished within four years, and to celebrate it we decide to build man-made island, and we built that island in 18 months.", "And I haven’t tried but I would wager that if one tried to build a new island in San Francisco, it would be difficult to do so today in 18 months.", "When France decided to build the TGV, its high speed rail, it opened the first line after five years.", "California started pursuing high speed rail 11 years ago. We forecast being finished in 2033, so we project a 25-year project, but of course that’s a projection.", "So this is the domain where it’s hard to imagine that building infrastructure had gotten intrinsically harder, right?", "The atoms aren’t physically heavier than they used to be, right? And so clearly there’s something institutional, sociological going on with infrastructure.", "Larry Summers talks about the idea of the promiscuous distribution of the veto power and how much harder it is to get things done.", "Inasmuch as that’s true, then there’s the question of, well, have other institutions, other progress-generating mechanisms in our society — have they also got less efficient?", "ZUCKERBERG: So as an aside, if you’re watching this, Patrick collects these examples of of historical projects that went fast and that you can’t imagine how they went that fast.", "So if you Google his website, he has like a whole list of these that I think is pretty interesting and compelling when you go through all of them.", "COLLISON: Yeah, I think it’s just important to understand how effectively we as a species can do things when we’re organized the right way.", "Humanity is pretty amazing. And when possibilities are unlocked, when efficacy is enabled, we can do great things.", "COWEN: Sometimes it is a matter of actual will. So for the last 40 years, getting around for almost all Americans, it is slower.", "And before that, we had a period from 1800 say to 1970 when it got quicker and quicker and quicker. And now even flying in airplanes for most people is slower.", "Traffic is worse. Those are solvable problems. Manhattan should have congestion pricing and a stiffer form of it than they’re likely to opt for.", "So the notion that people have lost the ability to imagine a future much different and much better than what they know to me is one of the most worrying aspects of where we are now.", "COLLISON: Yeah, and quantitatively, I mean, if you look at the percentage of Americans who think that their kids’ lives will be better than theirs, that has been in monotonic decline — not strictly monotonic — but generally declining since World War II until, on an empirical basis, Americans are getting less hopeful about their futures, their kids’ futures, and that’s a really bad thing because it can be an auto-catalyzing process and a self-fulfilling prophecy.", "COWEN: And we’re supposed to be the most optimistic, forward-looking country. The data on France, how many people think their kids will be worse off — that’s much more worrying yet.", "And there may be a self-fulfilling prophecy to this. If you think the future won’t be so great, you’ll invest less, you won’t work as hard, you’ll contract your risk-taking.", "And you end up with a social and economic malaise. And, indeed, you see falling rates of economic growth in most of the Western world.", "ZUCKERBERG: So I’m curious how you would think about going about and studying these organizational changes.", "Going back to biomedical science, for example, just because this is an area we do a lot of work in. The woman who runs CZI Science Initiative, Cori Bargmann, she’s a very renowned scientist, and she has this theory that a lot of the granting process that NIH does — but also HHMI — it basically encourages very individualistic work, right?", "You give people grants, they work on their own, you’re not incentivizing people to work together. People actually want to work together, they want to coordinate.", "And when I was talking about the Human Cell Atlas, a lot of the issue there that needed to get dealt with was that a lot of people were working on cell atlases for different parts of the body, the liver cell atlas, whatever.", "But they were all in different data types and formats, so that way you couldn’t compile a holistic thing.", "So a lot of what she did and the work of CZI was basically helping to coordinate. That way when these grants were given, everything — like the teams worked together, the data types were similar, so that way it all added up to a bigger thing.", "And that certainly seems like one of many theories that one could have for how you could organize this stuff better.", "But there’s this question of how much of progress — whether that’s something that one could have determined just through historical data versus this is the type of thing you need people or the government or foundations to go out and just run different experiments and see how this works.", "And I’m curious how you think about, in terms of studying this, how much this is like this history and history of science based on data that’s already out there versus “we should just try different models of things and encourage more creativity and more competition and try different things.”", "COWEN: It’s striking to me, if you look at American universities, the list of the top places in 1920 and the list today — it’s completely the same, except we’ve added on California.", "Otherwise, no change. Top 50 universities — if you look at —", "ZUCKERBERG: Decade over decade, the list of the top ten companies by market cap almost completely turns over.", "COWEN: Yes. Procedures for tenure in the top 50 research universities — almost exactly the same. Whatever you think of those, there’s something gone wrong in the sector.", "There’s not enough experimentation with how you reward people. More schools should experiment with a different tenure or reward people more on the basis of practical impact.", "And again, you might object to any particular solution, but the extent to which experimentation has died at the institutional level, to me, is striking.", "COLLISON: And to underscore that point, if you look at the top 25 universities in the world today or the kinds of ranking, there’s lots of them.", "Seven of the top 25 are American universities that were started in a single 30-year period between 1861 and 1891.", "And if you look at where those universities come from and what were the people behind them thinking, they were very deliberately and specifically reform-minded.", "COLLISON: Absolutely. They thought well, obviously, academic institutions exist. Harvard, Yale, and so on were already around.", "But they saw the success of German research university model, they saw the possibilities of the U.S., and they saw at least what they thought was required for the future.", "And they very deliberately decided, “We will try something different.” And again, that yielded now seven of the top 25 universities today.", "So I think it strongly empirically underscores the value of the experimentation you’re talking about.", "And, I fully agree. I think we should be historically informed but ultimately, a certain amount of commitment, decision, and just willingness to experiment is going to be required.", "The other thing I think your point with — so the teams gets at is there are these really thought-provoking examples of just like productive cultures through history?", "Look at Vienna, 1880 to 1940 or something. In so many different fields you have people who do this incredibly informative work: Klimt and you had Mahler and you had Mach in physics and you had, of course, Austrian economics and von Mises and Hayek and all the rest and you had Freud and you had Wittgenstein.", "Vienna was amazing in this period. And when you dig into the specific stories you realize a lot of these people knew each other and they were inspired by each other.", "They give credit to each other for, again, across multiple disciplines, different parts of their thinking.", "Or if you look at Edinburgh during the Scottish Enlightenment, again, a tiny place. Edinburgh in 1780 was like the size of Santa Cruz, right?", "And yet you get modern economics from Smith, you have Hume, you have the birth of modern geology, amazing literature, poetry and so on.", "And so clearly there was something excellent in Edinburgh in 1780 that was not there in Dublin in 1780.", "And I think obviously it’s hard to pin down what was that thing, but at the same time the difficulty in defining it doesn’t mean it wasn’t there or it’s not important.", "COWEN: I would say this. I’m sitting here with two university dropouts. That’s notable to me. The Bay Area is our modern Vienna.", "Bravo to the Bay Area. But we’re not working nearly hard enough to build other new Viennas and other places.", "And I don’t really think it’s quite Manhattan anymore. It’s a wonderful city and amazing place to go, but it is not a world leader for ideas in the way in it was, say, in the 1920s through the 1980s.", "ZUCKERBERG: People study this, right? I mean, so what would have been the main things that people have learned so far from studying Vienna or Edinburgh?", "COLLISON: Well, I don’t think there’s a rich literature of lessons from those places. Obviously, lots has been written about them.", "There are great historical accounts. I’ve enjoyed reading them. But it’s an intrinsically very difficult thing to do to figure out which things causally mattered.", "And these things, there’s a certain degree to which they might be over-determined. And so I think it’s very hard.", "You don’t have counterfactuals. Obviously, you can’t run trials, and so I think it is a very difficult question to answer.", "And I think for understandable reasons, people studying these questions are reluctant to take definitive stances that “this is what mattered” in 1900 Vienna.", "COWEN: But one lesson I would say — the Scottish islands, people moved to Edinburgh, right? Vienna, you have Jews coming in from the Pale of Settlement.", "The Bay Area, people coming from all over the world, and indeed, you [Collison] are from Ireland. So immigration — immigration is not a guarantee of things going well.", "But the bringing together of different ideas and cultures and the new clash of opposing perspectives has been correlated with a lot of these Viennas in the world history.", "COLLISON: Very true, although I’m pretty sure that in the 1900s, Paris had more foreigners than Vienna.", "COWEN: If you go from the Scottish islands to Edinburgh in 1740, that’s a huge difference. It’s a bigger difference than maybe Mexico to Los Angeles today.", "ZUCKERBERG: So if you’re thinking about what work to fund in terms of studying historical progress, what’s your framework for figuring out where to even begin studying?", "Because I mean, what you’re talking about here is basically studying the economic and scientific result of immigration, which is obviously a massively socially important debate that’s at the center of a lot of political debates and has been for a long time.", "So from one perspective, it’s surprising that it wouldn’t have been studied in more detail to understand the impact of it.", "But that’s very different from the biomedical science-type stuff that we were talking about a second ago.", "Do you have a framework in your head for how would think about or prioritize study in different areas, or is it mostly just about finding really sharp people who have new ideas and funding them to do different kinds or work?", "COWEN: People who are curious. People who have bold ambitions. People who have what I call stamina — they just don’t even stop.", "People who are working in productive small groups that maybe through WhatsApp, in fact, or it could be their next door neighbors, their colleagues at a university.", "When those, say, four items come together, then I think you have possibly what is a very good funding decision, and I would take a lot of chances on those people, not worry too much about the micromanaging, and let talent rip and let groups form and see what happens.", "ZUCKERBERG: Got it. So it’s very much like entrepreneurship in that way. You’re betting on the person more than the idea —", "COWEN: But also the vision, right? There has to be a vision, and there are plenty of successful entrepreneurs who are not curious.", "So for intellectual progress, to really put curiosity very highly is part of my philosophy.", "COLLISON: On the one hand, not only do we acknowledge that an immense amount of very important insightful work has already been created, and it’s that work that has to a large degree inspired both of our viewpoints.", "For example, the paper Tyler mentioned about declining research productivity in semiconductors, crop yields and a couple of other fields, that was done fairly close to here and that is work squarely relevant to these questions that I think is really important and we may not be here in the same way without it.", "On the other hand, it is simultaneously true that major swathes of these questions really are surprisingly under-investigated.", "And so, again, to return to biomedical funding and the NIH, as far as I can tell, there are no books assessing how well the NIH is working.", "And I don’t have a strong view on the answer to that question, but I do have a strong view on the importance of knowing.", "Which parts of the NIH are working better and worse? And inasmuch as the NIH has changed over the last couple of decades, was the old NIH better or the new one?", "Like, this stuff is so important, and so while it’s the case that there’s a huge amount of good research happening today with fantastic researchers, in a sense, there aren’t enough of them.", "And a lot of the central questions are still unanswered.", "ZUCKERBERG: Yeah, interesting. So you were talking a minute ago about the explosion in costs in healthcare.", "And right now, I think one of the defining aspects of the moment that we’re in is a lot of the basic costs of living for a lot of people have just increased a lot.", "The story that we tell about our society is that you have technology and you have competition and it drives down prices.", "So if you bought a ten-year-old TV today it would cost 5% of what it cost ten years ago. So clearly, the value and efficiency has increased a lot there.", "But then in things that matter so much like healthcare, education, rent — those things have generally just increased, right?", "And the normal dynamics that you’d be hoping would play out aren’t. And to some degree, for the quality of life for a lot of people, the increases in those costs may even be dwarfing all the other advances in everything else.", "ZUCKERBERG: So do you think that those things are all related? I think you used the phrase “cost disease”when referring to the cost explosion of things like healthcare and education, student debt, and rent.", "Do you think that’s a different type of problem, or do you think that is fundamentally related to the rate of progress in biomedicine, as an example?", "COWEN: I think there are common features to these problems, though each one is different. Restrictions on entry is one, highly bureaucratized institutions.", "Sometimes a lot of third party payment — which may be required in the case of catastrophic healthcare, but it nonetheless has distorting effects.", "Areas where people have very strong moral feelings I think we often make worse decisions about. We’re not analytical enough.", "And you put all of those together. But I would stress, say healthcare — if you go to Singapore, healthcare there, I think it’s about 4% of GDP.", "They have slightly higher life expectancy than we do. Their system is by no means perfect. But we can see, though comparative analysis, there are ways of doing this better.", "The NIMBY problem, cost of living, getting an apartment. In Japan, it is mostly solved because building in Japan tends to be regulated at higher levels than the city or the county, so more gets built.", "Living in Japan is cheaper, the cost of renting an apartment. So often we know the answers. We shy away from really focusing on a concerted effort to get to doing them in this country.", "COLLISON: Yeah, and agree with all of that, and I would just underscore the entry costs aspect. And the entry costs aren’t always — they take different forms, right?", "And empirically the entry costs of forming a new university are really high, but that’s not because there’s a kind of formal toll you have to pay.", "It’s not like zoning where there are deliberate, specific legal restrictions that prohibit you from doing so.", "But just as a practical matter: sociologically, institutionally, accreditation dynamics, who knows, it’s apparently almost impossibly difficult to create a successful new university today.", "And so I think answering the cost disease question is one of the most important set of subcomponents in this broader question of what is it that enables our progress.", "And at an overarching level, it’s just surprising to me that we don’t have more definitive and clear answers there.", "COLLISON: Exactly, last summer. And there are other papers also analyzing the question, but it’s a surprisingly sparse literature.", "Alex’s list of citations was not that long. And he had some suggestions as to what the underlying etiology might be — maybe he’s right, maybe he’s wrong — but again, to your point, it’s one of the most pressing questions for American society, for global society in 2019.", "We really have to know what’s happening. And to return to something Tyler said earlier, part of our hope — it’s not to promote any specific solution, any specific aspect of it, but rather that even though this is not what’s focally central in the headlines today, it should be.", "As we think about what the world is gonna look like in 50 years or 100 years, it, plausibly more than anything else, is going to determine the shape of that.", "COWEN: As an entrepreneur, what is it you find most striking about America’s dysfunctional economic sectors?", "Because you intersect with them all the time, right?", "ZUCKERBERG: Yeah, I mean, I would want to see this get studied more. There are just so many different factors, and I think part of it what is a little bit confusing is that the things that are making healthcare so expensive — they may have some fundamental link to the things that make college tuition so expensive.", "But on its surface it seems like there are also more proximate causes that are quite different. So with college tuition, the fact that it’s really expensive, so then we do more to subsidize the cost of it, and then by doing so, we’re not providing any pressure on colleges to make it more efficient, and then the cost just goes up further is a pretty different dynamic than what’s going on with healthcare where basically Americans want to know that if someone in their family gets sick, they’re going to be able to get every treatment possible, which ends up — I’m sure you’ve seen all the stats on this, — that half of the healthcare costs someone incurs is during the last six months of their life.", "And that’s, I guess, part of what you’re saying is an American moral value, which is that we believe that you should do everything you can to help someone who’s sick, whereas in a lot of other countries — I don’t know what Singapore’s situation is — but a lot of the ones that are often cited as more efficient healthcare systems don’t have that approach.", "They say, okay, if someone in your family has this form of cancer, we’ll do these two treatments, and then we’re done.", "And part of that is because they may not be able to incur the level of debt as a country that the U.S. can, so they may just have to make that tradeoff.", "But it creates all these downstream dynamics where now if you as a society are willing to say we’re going have two treatments for this cancer and not try all seven things, then now France can go, for example, negotiate with the drug companies and say, all right, I’m only going support the two that are the most cost-effective, and the other ones are out to dry.", "Whereas in the American system you don’t have that negotiating leverage. So it seems like they’re very different things.", "But intuitively, it seems like at their root there should be some commonalities. And I would be very interested to understand that in more detail.", "I’m curious why from what you’re saying about — that the literature is sparse —", "ZUCKERBERG: Yeah, why do you think more people aren’t studying this? I mean given that this is just such a central thing in the lives of most people, right, I mean, the cost of living in the city has gone up so much.", "We have a whole generation of students — I think the total student debt is now almost $2 trillion, right?", "I think it was $1.7 trillion the last stat that I saw. And of course healthcare is — the number of people in the country who are one issue away from being bankrupt is just staggering.", "COWEN: In academia I wouldn’t say anything’s preventing them. The incentive is to build a brick and to build a brick that can survive scrutiny by referees.", "The incentive is not to build a building, in most cases. Biomedicine actually is often different. But in the social sciences there’s so many bricks out there and so people want to say, oh, we’re already studying this.", "It’s correct, the bricks are there in the millions. But the bricks and the buildings are a different thing.", "But I have a question for you, if I may be allowed.", "COWEN: What is it you would most like to see from academics? And I don’t mean research on social media.", "ZUCKERBERG: Although I would like more research on social media.", "ZUCKERBERG: No, look, I think these issues on exploding costs and why the systems aren’t working the way that they’re supposed to for people is probably one of the most pressing questions.", "And when I think about our work over the next decade, it’s like what are we going do that’s will fundamentally make people’s lives better?", "There’s a lot that we can do. But if these problems continue at the rate that they’re going at, it’s actually quite hard for me to imagine how we could do enough good to overcome the increase in costs that people are incurring at things that are so fundamental.", "So we’re working on them in somewhat different ways. But I think healthcare is difficult because it is so inherently political because it touches on moral values.", "If you wanna have a difference in approach of how we treat the last six months of people’s lives, that’s something that’s more of a democratic question than a technocratic one, I think.", "People need to be able to support that. So I don’t personally feel like that’s an area that I’m gonna have a huge impact.", "A lot of people are focused on that. But the area that I do think we can make a big impact is on long-term science research.", "So if you can just make it more efficient to cure, prevent, or manage diseases, then that over the long-term should really be the answer for bringing healthcare costs in line, not in the next ten years, but maybe in over the next 50 years.", "I’d like to see a solution before that, so I’d love to see more studying of the healthcare part of this.", "But on the science side, I’m quite optimistic about that.", "On housing, I don’t know. There’s always the question of which forces in technology — which trends — end up being stronger?", "So on the one hand you have this giant mismatch of opportunity where people feel compelled to move to cities because that’s where a lot of the jobs are.", "But then there’s not enough building of supply of housing, so rent just increases. And then that means that even though people are going and doing higher-value things, their lives actually aren’t benefiting as much from that because so much of their costs are just of the value that they’re generating is just going to housing because rent is getting so high.", "So historically, what have people done? We invented cars and freeways. That way people could live further out.", "Maybe something like the Hyperloop could extend suburbs like five times as far, so that could make it so someone could live quite further away.", "And that would be good, right, if you can increase the effective radius of a city — that’s one way to alleviate constraints, political constraints or concerns about people building things, so that way you can get more supply, bring the cost down.", "I happen to think a different thing is probably the right solution. In 2019, it’s a lot easier to move bits around than it is atoms.", "So rather than people inventing a new Hyperloop or cars, I tend to think the set of technologies — whether it’s augmented reality or virtual reality or video presence that just lets people be where they wanna be physically and feel present with other people wherever they need to be to do their job, to connect with the people they care about — that feels to me the better long-term solution.", "Don’t make everyone move to cities. Make it so people can choose where they wanna be and can get access to all the opportunities they want.", "It’s hard for me to imagine more important problems over the next decade. I think over the longer term potentially climate change is more of an existential issue.", "But in terms of people’s lives today, I think the exploding costs from these areas is such a profound issue, and the trend is so out of control.", "COLLISON: Three three quick points on that. One is, I think these questions are often a little bit — like the cost of disease question, I think one of the reasons it’s difficult to study is because you have to take this very macroscopic and potentially this very microscopic view.", "And so say, for example in science, if it were the case that the administrative burden on scientists had increased by say two-thirds over the last 40 years.", "I’m not saying it has and not saying that even if it has that is, in fact, the cause of any kind of slowdown.", "But if it had, that might be quite difficult to observe because it can come in the form of, well, it takes twice as long on average for things to be approved and the forms are longer and you’re interrupted more.", "And so actually specifically diagnosing that causal pathways can really be quite tricky, and I think that generalizes a lot of the fields.", "Secondly, to your point about technology solving the agglomeration imperative of cities, I think that could be true, although, you know, here we are in person.", "ZUCKERBERG: Yeah, the people are watching wherever else.", "COLLISON: Very fair. But even if technology solved that, I guess my worry would be that the socio-institutional dynamics that have ruined cities or made them less effective or whatever, probably also generalized and applied to other domains.", "And so we’re going to suffer the costs of those same phenomena elsewhere.", "COLLISON: What have you learned from doing CZI? You launched it five years ago?", "COLLISON: Okay, yeah. How will the next four years be different to the first four?", "ZUCKERBERG: Well, so one of the things that we struggle with here that these are such a long-term projects.", "So we talked a lot about the scientific research. We’re also doing a bunch of work with education to build tools for teachers to do more project-based learning, more personalized learning for kids.", "But basically make it so that teachers have tools to do the work that they want to do, like mentoring students and not just having to lecture and have everyone learn at the same pace.", "And I think one of the meta questions in running CZI is at what point to check in and consider evolving the direction.", "I mean, obviously, there’s minor execution things that you try to improve along the way. But I want to make sure that we have an awareness that fundamentally these are problems that we’re gonna be working on for 10 or 20 years and not — I think a lot of these things just a consistency of approach, and building trust is more important than constantly evaluating or potentially thrashing.", "In science, we’ve had the benefit of taking on a number of different projects. So the Human Cell Atlas was one of the original ones.", "Now one of the next areas that we’re really excited to work on is imaging. There’s a lot of advances in microscopy, but there are a lot of things that we still can’t see.", "And as engineers, I think one of the things that you can probably appreciate is when you’re trying to debug a system, you really want to get into the code and step through it to see where the thing is breaking down.", "But we don’t really have a way today to see a white blood cell eat a a virus, right? Like in vivo, right?", "In the body. To see proteins folding live. And I think that there are certain optical thresholds on the physics that you might not be able to get beyond, but between that and the advances in AI, I do think that it’s possible to give scientists new imaging capacity that hasn’t been possible before.", "So a lot of what we’re trying to do is — so with the Human Cell Atlas, we took an approach that was very broad and collaborative and somewhat chaotic, even, in a way.", "And I think we were able to learn some of the lessons from that as we’re now thinking about how we organize the imaging project about, okay, maybe it would be helpful to have more clearly established leadership around it up front.", "Maybe there are things that rather than having just one big project, there’re gonna be areas where we can just build tools that go into every lab.", "There’s one software package called [indistinct] that a lot of scientists — right now, the actual technology of microscopes is ahead of scientists’ ability to process the data.", "There’s this weird mismatch because —and it makes sense, because the NIH funding supports people to basically have a lab.", "COLLISON: Yeah, tool building is not really subsidized or supported that well.", "ZUCKERBERG: Yeah if you want to have a team of ongoing software engineers, you’re going to want an effort that’s going on for a while and that’s more than a couple of people.", "So kind of thing, I think, there’s a real niche that no one is doing that stuff at the scale it needs to get done.", "COLLISON: Yeah, and there’s uniform agreement on that particular point with every biomedical scientist that I speak with.", "ZUCKERBERG: Yeah, so I don’t know. From a meta point I’m a little wary of concluding which things have worked and not worked well yet.", "I mean, certainly not everything we’re gonna do is gonna work —", "ZUCKERBERG: Yeah, but it’s certainly interesting. And what I try to push the teams to do is make sure that the work that we’re doing are things that clearly would not have happened otherwise.", "Where I think, especially in a lot of these fields — in philanthropy, I think there are a lot of potential issues where it’s easy to give money to something and feel like you’re doing good because you probably are doing some good but lack the discipline to say, “am I doing the most good that I can?”", "So that’s the thing I push our team to do is develop really different theories. I’m quite confident that in education the work that we’re doing is just stuff that if we weren’t trying it, it’s not clear that anyone else would be doing an effort like this at scale.", "I feel really good about that. I think in imaging, something like that is going to be similar. Even in social advocacy, we’re doing a lot of work in criminal justice reform that’s a combination of advocacy and building tools for accountability and working with reform-minded prosecutors, that they can be more data-driven about who they try to bring charges against.", "Because they want to be fair, or at least a lot of folks want to be fair, and they don’t have the data to either optimize how they run their office or to hold the people in there accountable, so building those kinds of tools can be super helpful.", "And I’m quite confident that if we weren’t pushing on that — that’s a good theory to at least try to push on.", "COWEN: So like the criminal justice work, education, biomedical — what’s the underlying view or insider experience of yours that’s the common element behind those areas?", "Like, how do we boil down Mark Zuckerberg philanthropy to a smaller number of dimensions?", "ZUCKERBERG: Well, first of all, it’s not just me. I do it with my wife.", "ZUCKERBERG: She’s an important element to this because she is a teacher. She’s building a school. I mean, she spends a lot of time over there.", "She is a doctor, so if you’re looking at the education in health aspects, the domain expertise is more hers than mine.", "And she is quite compelling and insightful on some of the things that need to get done there.", "In terms of the approach, that may be more inspired by me in some ways where it’s the very long-term focus which I think it comes from a lot of the lessons I’ve learned from Facebook.", "It’s the tool-building which comes from having the experience building engineering teams. And it’s some of what we’ve learned just in managing and partnering with folks through building the company is that — it’s a lot of what you said.", "It’s like you want to bet on the best individuals in different spaces and give them room to run. In managing complex projects, you need to know when something needs to be a little more directive versus when you want it to just be an open thing that can make progress in a more chaotic way.", "And that might be more art than science — or at least until your field fully solves all these questions.", "But yeah, it’s an interesting set of questions, and certainly one animating theme certainly is as our kids grow up, we want to make sure that they live better lives.", "So these aren’t things that are primarily gonna benefit us, right? If we were trying to benefit us, we wouldn’t be working on education.", "I think the health work is very long-term oriented. If we were focused on our own health, you’d be probably be doing more disease-specific work rather than fundamental science — or tool-building for fundamental science — which might even be a level more abstract that fundamental science to try to compound the rate of progress in science.", "And then a lot of work on equality: the criminal justice work. A lot of the way that our country handles this stuff is just such an unfortunate outlier compared to other countries and the amount of human capital that is locked away is its own thing that I think deserves a lot more than just studying.", "But certainly I think just improving that would be a big advance.", "This conversation is interesting because I think it highlights somewhat of a distinction in — I guess my approach to learning or studying these things is more the “try different things and experiment” and then play it forward, generate new data that doesn’t exist and see how that goes.", "And talking to you and seeing the work that you do, and I guess this is probably intrinsic to being an academic too, where more of the work is about looking at datasets that can exist and studying what is already there rather than trying to create the new datasets or approaches.", "There are two approaches that I think complement each other but are actually quite different in terms of how you approach learning about how to do the best work going forward.", "COLLISON: Well, I think there is a very important complementarity where for any of these really important questions about how should science be organized, or which kinds of policies generate the most economic growth, or how one should support the diffusion of innovation, or whatever — I don’t think there exists definitive data on that question.", "I don’t think by just going deep into the literature you’re going come up with clear answers that one can feel confident in going and executing it or implementing.", "I think of the data, such that it exists, and the exiting findings as food for hypothesis-generation.", "For example, to return to the management training, that’s one. But I would probably not have guessed the effect sizes would be that large, right?", "And so if those studies hadn’t been conducted, I don’t think I would have ascribed sufficient expectation value to the effort of Stripe going and doing something better.", "But now because of those studies, I think perhaps there are things we could do on the margins. Maybe there are things that end up being quite materially valuable over time.", "And so I think being able to marshal those, potentially being able to encourage people to dig more in particular directions and then to combine that with a willingness to experiment and a willingness to frankly just be wrong.", "And I think the synthesis of that is really powerful.", "And again, if you go back and you look at the foundations that I think have really had significant impact over the past one hundred, two hundred years, I think it’s that kind of combination.", "Look at Warren Weaver, who was the guy at Rockefeller who funded Norman Borlaug, right? He’d worked with Vannevar Bush at OSRD during World War II.", "I think he was familiar with a lot of the data and just empirical realities of how different kinds of scientific and technological ventures were likely to work.", "But he was also willing to just place a bold bet and that pursue the hypothesis that agronomy could be radically improved.", "But there was no particularly strong basis to truly have conviction of that. And so I think it’s all in the combination.", "ZUCKERBERG: Yeah, interesting. So I’m curious to push further on one question. You asked me what I would want to be studying: why don’t you think people are studying the cost questions as much as it seems like they should be?", "If these are as big a questions for society, and it certainly seems like they’re issues that most people have — what are the structural barriers that are preventing the top people in these fields from deciding to go study it?", "Is it that the fields don’t line up with it? Is it that there’s not funding for it? Is it too hard in certain ways?", "Like, what are the dynamics that are going on here?", "COWEN: There are many big questions. It’s hard to study them. So at the end, you have quite a speculative answer or set of hypothesis.", "So the world as a whole isn’t sure what to make of that. Is it a real contribution? So the private return to you as a researcher maybe is unclear.", "So you tend to get very famous people who are quite well established looking at really big ideas maybe a bit later in their career.", "And I’m not saying that’s bad work, but it’s not necessarily cutting-edge either. And they spent their whole lives being famous, and they’re not necessarily in a position to actually make the breakthrough.", "And then younger people, their incentive is to first get established and do something that is quite defensible.", "So I think in general, big questions are under-studied. The tenure system, I think, increasingly is broken.", "A lot of academics do work pretty hard, but that so much of your audience is a narrowly defined set of peers who write you reference and tenure letters, I think we need to change.", "And the incentive for academics to integrate with practitioners and learn from them and actually try doing things, we need more of that.", "I’ve often suggested for graduate school, instead of taking a class, everyone should be sent to a not-so-high-income village for two weeks.", "They can do whatever they want. Just go for two weeks, think about things. No one wants to do this. No one wants to experiment with it.", "People who do development often do it on their own. But the notion that every economist should have studied the East Asian economic miracle, the Industrial Revolution, and spent two weeks or more in a poor village — it’s just not how things are, and I’d like to change that.", "ZUCKERBERG: So how does one go about changing that? So if you’re trying to create a network of people who feel like they have an incentive to study this because it’s gonna be good for their career, and they have a network of supportive people who might be reviewing the grants or the work that they’re doing and also think that this is important work to be done — how do you go about establishing that?", "COWEN: I can selfishly say that at George Mason, virtually all of our students have very directly studied these questions, and we funded a lot of them to go live other distant, strange, possibly poor places.", "Other departments may have more money than we do. It can be done, because we’ve done it at George Mason.", "So I think again it’s a question of the will and just the ability and desire to imagine that things could be quite different in a sense that I think was more common in the America, say, of 1958 or JFK’s decision to put a man on the moon than you see actually in 2019.", "ZUCKERBERG: All right, is that a good place to wrap?", "ZUCKERBERG: All right. Well, thank you, guys. This has been a great conversation."]}

The message coming from Facebook’s leadership is not about how it has failed its users.", "Instead it's about how users —and especially developers —have failed Facebook, and how Facebook needs to step in to take exclusive control over your data.", "You may remember Facebook's initial response, which was to say that whatever Cambridge Analytica had gotten away with, the problem was already solved.", "As Paul Grewal, Facebook's deputy general counsel, wrote in that first statement, \"In the past five years, we have made significant improvements in our ability to detect and prevent violations by app developers\" Most significantly, he added, in 2014 Facebook \"made an update to ensure that each person decides what information they want to share about themselves, including their friend list.", "This is just one of the many ways we give people the tools to control their experience. \"", "By the time Zuckerberg had reached Washington, D.C., however, the emphasis was less about users controlling their experience, and more about Facebook’s responsibility to make sure those outside Facebook—namely developers and users—were doing the right thing.", "A week after Grewal's statement, Zuckerberg made his first public comments about Cambridge Analytica.", "\"I was maybe too idealistic on the side of data portability,” he told Recode's Kara Swisher and Kurt Wagner.", "Going forward, preventing future privacy scandals \"[is] going to be solved by restricting the amount of data that developers can have access to.\"", "In both versions, the fault supposedly lay with third parties, not with Facebook. But Mark Zuckerberg has made it clear that he now takes a “broader view” of Facebook's responsibility.", "We didn't take a broad enough view of our responsibility... It's not enough to just connect people, we have to make sure that those connections are positive.", "It's not enough to just give people a voice, we need to make sure that people aren't using it to harm other people or to spread misinformation.", "And it's not enough to just give people control over their information, we need to make sure that the developers they share it with protect their information, too.", "Across the board, we have a responsibility to not just build tools, but to make sure that they're used for good.", "By far the most substantial shift Facebook has already taken in this direction has been to limit further how third-parties can access data it holds for its users.", "Facebook began removing access to its APIs across its platforms earlier this month, from Instagram to Facebook search.", "But that move just causes a new form of collateral damage. Shutting down third-party access and APIs doesn't just mean restricting creepy data snatchers like Cambridge Analytica.", "APIs are the ways that machines ingest what we read in our web browsers and Facebook's offical apps. Even then, we're only operating one hop from a bot: your Web browser is an automated client, tapping into Facebook's data feeds using Facebook's own web code.", "Facebook apps are just automated programs that talk to Facebook with a larger set of the interfaces that it permits others to use.", "Even if you're just hitting “refresh” on the feed over lunch, it's all automated in the end.", "By locking down its APIs, Facebook is giving people less power over their information and reserving that power for itself.", "By locking down its APIs, Facebook is giving people less power over their information and reserving that power for itself.", "In effect, Facebook is narrowing and eliminating the ways that legitimate users can engage with their own data.", "And that means that we're set to become even more dependent on Facebook's decisions about what to do with that information.", "What is worse, we've seen a wave of similar rhetoric elsewhere. Twitter announced (then backed down from) a rapid shutdown of an API that creators outside the company depended upon for implementing alternative Twitter clients.", "In response to a court case brought by academics to establish their right to examine services like Facebook for discrimination, Bloomsberg View columnist Noah Feldman claimed last week that permitting such automated scanning would undermine Facebooks' ability to protect the privacy of its users.", "We'd emphatically disagree. But you can expect more columns like that if Facebook decides to defend your data by doubling down on laws like the CFAA.", "Here’s a concrete example. Supposing you'd like to #deletefacebook and move to another service—and you'd like to take your friends with you.", "That may mean you'd like to persuade them to move to a new better service with you. Or you might just want to keep the memories of your friends and your interactions with them intact as you move on from Facebook.", "You wouldn't want to leave Facebook without your conversations and favorite threads. You wouldn't want to find that you could take your own photographs, but not pictures of you with your family and colleagues.", "You'd like all that data as takeout.

As we saw with SESTA/FOSTA, established tech companies can be persuaded to support such laws, even when they unwind the openness and freedom that let those companies prosper in the first place.", "That is the shift that Zuckerberg is signaling in his offers to take responsibility in Washington.", "But there is an alternative: We could empower Internet users, not big Internet companies, to decide what they want to do with their private data.", "It would mean answering some tough questions about how we get consent for data that is personal and private for more than one person, like conversations, photographs, my knowledge of you and you of me—and how individuals can seek redress when those that they trust—whether it's Facebook, or a small developer—break that trust.", "But beginning that long-overdue conversation now is surely going to end with a better result than making the existing business leaders of Silicon Valley the newly deputized sheriffs of our data, with shiny badges from Washington, and an impregnable new jail in which to hold it."]}

The film begins with loneliness and frustration, tapping into a fictionalized Mark Zuckerberg’s (Jesse Eisenberg) romantic rejection as the birth of a billion-dollar product.", "But quickly, as the story picks up steam, the product becomes a bargaining chip, and its users, dollar signs.", "The movie ends up delving deep into Sorkin’s imagined portrait of Zuckerberg, which allows the West Wing creator to grapple with some of the themes that have preoccupied him for his whole career: status, exclusivity, ego, ambition.", "We watch Zuckerberg—an asshole, from the first frame—brilliantly and callously alienate everyone who might care for him, until by the end, in Sorkin’s imagination, he is the youngest billionaire on earth, but alone.", "Don’t be an asshole is the movie’s implicit takeaway.", "There’s lots of temptation to be an asshole, especially at Harvard, which the movie turns into a richly realized universe—both utterly banal and irritatingly self-obsessed.", "The macho bullying that Mark subjects the Winklevoss twins to (Armie Hammer and Josh Pence) isn’t an isolated event; Eduardo Saverin (Andrew Garfield) gets old-school hazed by an all-male final club in not dissimilar fashion.", "Eisenberg’s Zuckerberg faces the type of choices that a lot of smart men face, like choosing between expressing your feelings or being a dick, or between apologizing or demonizing, or between your friends and your rapacious, devouring ambitions.", "His story ends up being a cautionary tale. You might end up rich and famous and more powerful than most nation-states, but you’ll still be an asshole.", "I say “men,” because I do think Sorkin’s script is meant for men.

The movie’s only dimensional female character is Rooney Mara, playing the girlfriend that dumps Zuckerberg in the opening scene—and even she’s not that dimensional.", "She’s just a human being that has boobs and feelings at the same time. (How clever of her.) The Social Network takes pains to demonstrate that Zuckerberg’s casual exploitation of women is not happening in a vacuum: facemash.com’s creation montage is intercut with a bus full of hot girls being shipped to a party at one of the exclusive final clubs he’s obsessed with.", "The ultra-cool party might only be happening in his mind, but the point is, there are girls, they are wearing tight dresses, and they are willing to play strip poker with some class of Harvard man—just not him.", "But Sorkin’s take on Zuckerberg is ahistorical. The real Mark Zuckerberg started dating Priscilla Chan in 2003, when the movie begins, and married her in 2012.", "Their relationship makes the characters’ fetishizing comments about the appeal and unapproachability of Asian girls even more inscrutable.", "The real facemash.com used both women’s and men’s photos for hot-or-not comparisons; perhaps still an exploitative venture, but not quite the boorish barnyard-animal bot that the movie suggests.", "The movie leans into Zuckerberg as horny nerd misogynist. But the real culprit seems to be Sorkin, who invents several excuses to show coeds in their underwear, from Brenda Song to Dakota Johnson.", "Harvard women who are not wearing thigh-high boots and eyeliner simply do not exist in the film. Perhaps we are meant to interpret their invisibility as an extension of this fictional Mark’s view of the world, where only the certain type of woman he wants to impress exists—but watching the movie, it seems as if the filmmakers simply do not see them either.", "As Facebook grows, the movie cares less and less about it. By 2010, though, the website’s user base was dominated by women like me.", "(The gap has narrowed in the years since, but the majority of Facebook users are still women.)

Cambridge Analytica hadn’t yet harvested data from 87 million users to influence several elections, including the 2016 presidential election.", "We didn’t yet know that Facebook would create the bulk of its revenue by learning about us, through the data we gave it, and then relentlessly targeting advertising at us—not just on the platform, but off of it too.", "We had not yet watched mainstream publications become beholden to the Facebook algorithm, nor had we observed how Facebook Groups have become hot zones for disseminating misinformation.", "We were just at the beginning of understanding how Facebook filters and tailors the information presented to users, while simultaneously using addictive engagement algorithms to keep users on the site.", "The whistleblower Sophie Zhang had not yet said, as she did just a few weeks ago, that after spending several overworked years trying to prevent global political manipulation that “I have blood on my hands.”", "But by 2010, Facebook was already both rotten and indispensable. It had demonstrated a way of crawling under your skin and staying there that I, at least, could attest to.", "(In a bid for improving my mental health, I quit Facebook in 2011; currently, I have an inactive profile as a placeholder account.)", "McNeil notes in Lurking that anxieties about Facebook are as old as the platform itself; the sleek exterior and ad-free environment prompted many users, if not all, to wonder how Zuckerberg’s product was planning to make money.", "Zadie Smith noted her own anxieties about Facebook’s usage of her data in her graceful 2010 takedown of the “wildly enjoyable, wildly inaccurate biopic.”", "The movie has to alter the real Zuckerberg to make sense of him; it doesn’t even begin to scratch the surface of the user experience of the literal social network it’s named after.", "Fincher and Sorkin’s portrait of a fictional man’s fictional ambitions to produce a social networking website has power; there are lessons in there about humanity, and not being a dick, that have resonated with many fans.", "But it has nothing to do with the actual Mark Zuckerberg, and even less to do with Facebook. And for that, I cannot entirely forgive it.", "There was much that needed to be said; there is much that company still needs to be held accountable for.", "I imagine it will be bizarre to future audiences that The Social Network was so lauded. Already, in 2020, it is a laughably naive portrait of Zuckerberg, a story about what’s wrong with Facebook that simply doesn’t understand what’s wrong with Facebook.", "Even Sorkin has more or less repudiated his portrait of Zuckerberg. In 2011, accepting his Golden Globe for screenwriting, he apologized for being too harsh on Zuckerberg, noting that the technocrat was a “great entrepreneur, a visionary, and an incredible altruist.”", "But last year, in an opinion piece for the New York Times, he wrote a kind of brotherly scold to Zuckerberg, calling Facebook’s irresponsible framing of false, politically motivated posts an assault on truth.", "“If I’d known you felt that way, I’d have had the Winklevoss twins invent Facebook,” he quipped.", "Sorkin is still too dazzled by the skills of a tech genius, I think, to really blame Zuckerberg for what Facebook has become.", "Much as the movie relentlessly tries to be on Mark’s side, despite his atrocious behavior, Sorkin’s op-ed approaches Zuckerberg with reverence, certain that he just doesn’t understand the ramifications of what he’s done.", "But what those who live in Facebook’s world know is that regardless of what Zuckerberg understands, he just doesn’t care.", "This is a man whose motto once was “companies over countries.” His ambition has not diminished with success; Facebook is currently gathering data on users who don’t even have Facebook profiles, in an effort to index every single person on the planet.", "According to McNeil, Zuckerberg never abandoned the view of his own users as “dumb fucks.” “At its worst,” she writes, “Facebook is fully parasitic of everything human, while also, with its preset filters and artificial groupings, bulldozing the agency of users as individuals.”", "With humor, she adds that she tries to maintain some critical distance when writing about tech platforms—but Facebook’s banal terribleness outmatches her capacity for objectivity.", "“I hate it. The company is one of the biggest mistakes in modern history, a digital cesspool that, while calamitous when it fails, is at its most dangerous when it works as intended.", "I like the phrasing.

Many Americans know about the Enlightenment history and how we enshrined the First Amendment in our constitution, but fewer know how dramatically our cultural norms and legal protections have expanded, even in recent history.", "The first Supreme Court case to seriously consider free speech and the First Amendment was in 1919, Schenk vs the United States.", "Back then, the First Amendment only applied to the federal government, and states could and often did restrict your right to speak.", "Our ability to call out things we felt were wrong also used to be much more restricted. Libel laws used to impose damages if you wrote something negative about someone, even if it was true.", "The standard later shifted so it became okay as long as you could prove your critique was true. We didn’t get the broad free speech protections we have now until the 1960s, when the Supreme Court ruled in opinions like New York Times vs Sullivan that you can criticize public figures as long as you’re not doing so with actual malice, even if what you’re saying is false.", "We now have significantly broader power to call out things we feel are unjust and share our own personal experiences.", "Movements like #BlackLivesMatter and #MeToo went viral on Facebook — the hashtag #BlackLivesMatter was actually first used on Facebook — and this just wouldn’t have been possible in the same way before.", "100 years back, many of the stories people have shared would have been against the law to even write down.", "And without the internet giving people the power to share them directly, they certainly wouldn’t have reached as many people.", "With Facebook, more than 2 billion people now have a greater opportunity to express themselves and help others.", "While it’s easy to focus on major social movements, it’s important to remember that most progress happens in our everyday lives.", "It’s the Air Force moms who started a Facebook group so their children and other service members who can’t get home for the holidays have a place to go.", "It’s the church group that came together during a hurricane to provide food and volunteer to help with recovery.", "It’s the small business on the corner that now has access to the same sophisticated tools only the big guys used to, and now they can get their voice out and reach more customers, create jobs and become a hub in their local community.", "Progress and social cohesion come from billions of stories like this around the world.", "People having the power to express themselves at scale is a new kind of force in the world — a Fifth Estate alongside the other power structures of society.", "People no longer have to rely on traditional gatekeepers in politics or media to make their voices heard, and that has important consequences.", "I understand the concerns about how tech platforms have centralized power, but I actually believe the much bigger story is how much these platforms have decentralized power by putting it directly into people’s hands.", "It’s part of this amazing expansion of voice through law, culture and technology.", "So giving people a voice and broader inclusion go hand in hand, and the trend has been towards greater voice over time.", "But there’s also a counter-trend. In times of social turmoil, our impulse is often to pull back on free expression.", "We want the progress that comes from free expression, but not the tension.", "We saw this when Martin Luther King Jr. wrote his famous letter from Birmingham Jail, where he was unconstitutionally jailed for protesting peacefully.", "We saw this in the efforts to shut down campus protests against the Vietnam War. We saw this way back when America was deeply polarized about its role in World War I, and the Supreme Court ruled that socialist leader Eugene Debs could be imprisoned for making an anti-war speech.", "In the end, all of these decisions were wrong. Pulling back on free expression wasn’t the answer and, in fact, it often ended up hurting the minority views we seek to protect.", "From where we are now, it seems obvious that, of course, protests for civil rights or against wars should be allowed.", "Yet the desire to suppress this expression was felt deeply by much of society at the time.", "Today, we are in another time of social tension. We face real issues that will take a long time to work through — massive economic transitions from globalization and technology, fallout from the 2008 financial crisis, and polarized reactions to greater migration.", "In the face of these tensions, once again a popular impulse is to pull back from free expression. We’re at another cross-roads.", "We can continue to stand for free expression, understanding its messiness, but believing that the long journey towards greater progress requires confronting ideas that challenge us.", "Or we can decide the cost is simply too great. I’m here today because I believe we must continue to stand for free expression.", "At the same time, I know that free expression has never been absolute. Some people argue internet platforms should allow all expression protected by the First Amendment, even though the First Amendment explicitly doesn’t apply to companies.", "I’m proud that our values at Facebook are inspired by the American tradition, which is more supportive of free expression than anywhere else.", "But even American tradition recognizes that some speech infringes on others’ rights. And still, a strict First Amendment standard might require us to allow terrorist propaganda, bullying young people and more that almost everyone agrees we should stop — and I certainly do — as well as content like pornography that would make people uncomfortable using our platforms.", "So once we’re taking this content down, the question is: where do you draw the line? Most people agree with the principles that you should be able to say things other people don’t like, but you shouldn’t be able to say things that put people in danger.", "The shift over the past several years is that many people would now argue that more speech is dangerous than would have before.", "This raises the question of exactly what counts as dangerous speech online. It’s worth examining this in detail.", "Many arguments about online speech are related to new properties of the internet itself. If you believe the internet is completely different from everything before it, then it doesn’t make sense to focus on historical precedent.", "But we should be careful of overly broad arguments since they’ve been made about almost every new technology, from the printing press to radio to TV.", "Instead, let’s consider the specific ways the internet is different and how internet services like ours might address those risks while protecting free expression.", "One clear difference is that a lot more people now have a voice — almost half the world. That’s dramatically empowering for all the reasons I’ve mentioned.", "But inevitably some people will use their voice to organize violence, undermine elections or hurt others, and we have a responsibility to address these risks.", "When you’re serving billions of people, even if a very small percent cause harm, that can still be a lot of harm.", "We build specific systems to address each type of harmful content — from incitement of violence to child exploitation to other harms like intellectual property violations — about 20 categories in total.", "We judge ourselves by the prevalence of harmful content and what percent we find proactively before anyone reports it to us.", "For example, our AI systems identify 99% of the terrorist content we take down before anyone even sees it.", "This is a massive investment. We now have over 35,000 people working on security, and our security budget today is greater than the entire revenue of our company at the time of our IPO earlier this decade.", "All of this work is about enforcing our existing policies, not broadening our definition of what is dangerous.", "If we do this well, we should be able to stop a lot of harm while fighting back against putting additional restrictions on speech.", "Another important difference is how quickly ideas can spread online. Most people can now get much more reach than they ever could before.", "This is at the heart of a lot of the positive uses of the internet. It’s empowering that anyone can start a fundraiser, share an idea, build a business, or create a movement that can grow quickly.", "But we’ve seen this go the other way too — most notably when Russia’s IRA tried to interfere in the 2016 elections, but also when misinformation has gone viral.", "Some people argue that virality itself is dangerous, and we need tighter filters on what content can spread quickly.", "For misinformation, we focus on making sure complete hoaxes don’t go viral. We especially focus on misinformation that could lead to imminent physical harm, like misleading health advice saying if you’re having a stroke, no need to go to the hospital.", "More broadly though, we’ve found a different strategy works best: focusing on the authenticity of the speaker rather than the content itself.", "Much of the content the Russian accounts shared was distasteful but would have been considered permissible political discourse if it were shared by Americans — the real issue was that it was posted by fake accounts coordinating together and pretending to be someone else.", "We’ve seen a similar issue with these groups that pump out misinformation like spam just to make money.", "The solution is to verify the identities of accounts getting wide distribution and get better at removing fake accounts.", "We now require you to provide a government ID and prove your location if you want to run political ads or a large page.", "You can still say controversial things, but you have to stand behind them with your real identity and face accountability.", "Our AI systems have also gotten more advanced at detecting clusters of fake accounts that aren’t behaving like humans.", "We now remove billions of fake accounts a year — most within minutes of registering and before they do much.", "Focusing on authenticity and verifying accounts is a much better solution than an ever-expanding definition of what speech is harmful.", "Another qualitative difference is the internet lets people form communities that wouldn’t have been possible before.", "This is good because it helps people find groups where they belong and share interests. But the flip side is this has the potential to lead to polarization.", "I care a lot about this — after all, our goal is to bring people together.", "Much of the research I’ve seen is mixed and suggests the internet could actually decrease aspects of polarization.", "The most polarized voters in the last presidential election were the people least likely to use the internet.", "Research from the Reuters Institute also shows people who get their news online actually have a much more diverse media diet than people who don’t, and they’re exposed to a broader range of viewpoints.", "This is because most people watch only a couple of cable news stations or read only a couple of newspapers, but even if most of your friends online have similar views, you usually have some that are different, and you get exposed to different perspectives through them.", "Still, we have an important role in designing our systems to show a diversity of ideas and not encourage polarizing content.", "One last difference with the internet is it lets people share things that would have been impossible before.", "Take live-streaming, for example. This allows families to be together for moments like birthdays and even weddings, schoolteachers to read bedtime stories to kids who might not be read to, and people to witness some very important events.", "But we’ve also seen people broadcast self-harm, suicide, and terrible violence. These are new challenges and our responsibility is to build systems that can respond quickly.", "We’re particularly focused on well-being, especially for young people. We built a team of thousands of people and AI systems that can detect risks of self-harm within minutes so we can reach out when people need help most.", "In the last year, we’ve helped first responders reach people who needed help thousands of times.", "For each of these issues, I believe we have two responsibilities: to remove content when it could cause real danger as effectively as we can, and to fight to uphold as wide a definition of freedom of expression as possible — and not allow the definition of what is considered dangerous to expand beyond what is absolutely necessary.", "But beyond these new properties of the internet, there are also shifting cultural sensitivities and diverging views on what people consider dangerous content.", "Take misinformation. No one tells us they want to see misinformation. That’s why we work with independent fact checkers to stop hoaxes that are going viral from spreading.", "But misinformation is a pretty broad category. A lot of people like satire, which isn’t necessarily true.", "A lot of people talk about their experiences through stories that may be exaggerated or have inaccuracies, but speak to a deeper truth in their lived experience.", "We need to be careful about restricting that. Even when there is a common set of facts, different media outlets tell very different stories emphasizing different angles.", "There’s a lot of nuance here. And while I worry about an erosion of truth, I don’t think most people want to live in a world where you can only post things that tech companies judge to be 100% true.", "We recently clarified our policies to ensure people can see primary source speech from political figures that shapes civic discourse.", "Political advertising is more transparent on Facebook than anywhere else — we keep all political and issue ads in an archive so everyone can scrutinize them, and no TV or print does that.", "We don’t fact-check political ads. We don’t do this to help politicians, but because we think people should be able to see for themselves what politicians are saying.", "And if content is newsworthy, we also won’t take it down even if it would otherwise conflict with many of our standards.", "I know many people disagree, but, in general, I don’t think it’s right for a private company to censor politicians or the news in a democracy.", "And we’re not an outlier here. The other major internet platforms and the vast majority of media also run these same ads.", "American tradition also has some precedent here. The Supreme Court case I mentioned earlier that gave us our current broad speech rights, New York Times vs Sullivan, was actually about an ad with misinformation, supporting Martin Luther King Jr. and criticizing an Alabama police department.", "The police commissioner sued the Times for running the ad, the jury in Alabama found against the Times, and the Supreme Court unanimously reversed the decision, creating today’s speech standard.", "As a principle, in a democracy, I believe people should decide what is credible, not tech companies. Of course there are exceptions, and even for politicians we don’t allow content that incites violence or risks imminent harm — and of course we don’t allow voter suppression.", "Voting is voice. Fighting voter suppression may be as important for the civil rights movement as free expression has been.", "Just as we’re inspired by the First Amendment, we’re inspired by the 15th Amendment too.", "Given the sensitivity around political ads, I’ve considered whether we should stop allowing them altogether.", "From a business perspective, the controversy certainly isn’t worth the small part of our business they make up.", "But political ads are an important part of voice — especially for local candidates, up-and-coming challengers, and advocacy groups that may not get much media attention otherwise.", "Banning political ads favors incumbents and whoever the media covers.", "Even if we wanted to ban political ads, it’s not clear where we’d draw the line. There are many more ads about issues than there are directly about elections.", "Would we ban all ads about healthcare or immigration or women’s empowerment? If we banned candidates’ ads but not these, would that really make sense to give everyone else a voice in political debates except the candidates themselves?", "There are issues any way you cut this, and when it’s not absolutely clear what to do, I believe we should err on the side of greater expression.", "Or take hate speech, which we define as someone directly attacking a person or group based on a characteristic like race, gender or religion.", "We take down content that could lead to real world violence. In countries at risk of conflict, that includes anything that could lead to imminent violence or genocide.", "And we know from history that dehumanizing people is the first step towards inciting violence. If you say immigrants are vermin, or all Muslims are terrorists — that makes others feel they can escalate and attack that group without consequences.", "So we don’t allow that. I take this incredibly seriously, and we work hard to get this off our platform.", "American free speech tradition recognizes that some speech can have the effect of restricting others’ right to speak.", "While American law doesn’t recognize “hate speech” as a category, it does prohibit racial harassment and sexual harassment.", "We still have a strong culture of free expression even while our laws prohibit discrimination.", "But still, people have broad disagreements over what qualifies as hate and shouldn’t be allowed. Some people think our policies don’t prohibit content they think qualifies as hate, while others think what we take down should be a protected form of expression.", "I believe people should be able to use our services to discuss issues they feel strongly about — from religion and immigration to foreign policy and crime.", "You should even be able to be critical of groups without dehumanizing them. But even this isn’t always straightforward to judge at scale, and it often leads to enforcement mistakes.", "Is someone re-posting a video of a racist attack because they’re condemning it, or glorifying and encouraging people to copy it?", "Are they using normal slang, or using an innocent word in a new way to incite violence? Now multiply those linguistic challenges by more than 100 languages around the world.", "Rules about what you can and can’t say often have unintended consequences. When speech restrictions were implemented in the UK in the last century, parliament noted they were applied more heavily to citizens from poorer backgrounds because the way they expressed things didn’t match the elite Oxbridge style.", "In everything we do, we need to make sure we’re empowering people, not simply reinforcing existing institutions and power structures.", "That brings us back to the cross-roads we all find ourselves at today. Will we continue fighting to give more people a voice to be heard, or will we pull back from free expression?", "The first is legal. We’re increasingly seeing laws and regulations around the world that undermine free expression and people’s human rights.", "These local laws are each individually troubling, especially when they shut down speech in places where there isn’t democracy or freedom of the press.", "But it’s even worse when countries try to impose their speech restrictions on the rest of the world.", "This raises a larger question about the future of the global internet. China is building its own internet focused on very different values, and is now exporting their vision of the internet to other countries.", "Until recently, the internet in almost every country outside China has been defined by American platforms with strong free expression values.", "There’s no guarantee these values will win out. A decade ago, almost all of the major internet platforms were American.", "We’re beginning to see this in social media. While our services, like WhatsApp, are used by protesters and activists everywhere due to strong encryption and privacy protections, on TikTok, the Chinese app growing quickly around the world, mentions of these protests are censored, even in the US.", "It’s one of the reasons we don’t operate Facebook, Instagram or our other services in China. I wanted our services in China because I believe in connecting the whole world", "and I thought we might help create a more open society. I worked hard to make this happen. But we could never come to agreement on what it would take for us to operate there, and they never let us in.", "And now we have more freedom to speak out and stand up for the values we believe in and fight for free expression around the world.", "This question of which nation’s values will determine what speech is allowed for decades to come really puts into perspective our debates about the content issues of the day.", "While we may disagree on exactly where to draw the line on specific issues, we at least can disagree.", "That’s what free expression is. And the fact that we can even have this conversation means that we’re at least debating from some common values.", "If another nation’s platforms set the rules, our discourse will be defined by a completely different set of values.", "To push back against this, as we all work to define internet policy and regulation to address public safety, we should also be proactive and write policy that helps the values of voice and expression triumph around the world.", "The second challenge to expression is the platforms themselves — including us. Because the reality is we make a lot of decisions that affect people’s ability to speak.", "I’m committed to the values we’re discussing today, but we won’t always get it right. I understand people are concerned that we have so much control over how they communicate on our services.", "And I understand people are concerned about bias and making sure their ideas are treated fairly. Frankly, I don’t think we should be making so many important decisions about speech on our own either.", "We’d benefit from a more democratic process, clearer rules for the internet, and new institutions.", "That’s why we’re establishing an independent Oversight Board for people to appeal our content decisions.", "The board will have the power to make final binding decisions about whether content stays up or comes down on our services — decisions that our team and I can’t overturn.", "We’re going to appoint members to this board who have a diversity of views and backgrounds, but who each hold free expression as their paramount value.", "Building this institution is important to me personally because I’m not always going to be here, and I want to ensure the values of voice and free expression are enshrined deeply into how this company is governed.", "The third challenge to expression is the hardest because it comes from our culture. We’re at a moment of particular tension here and around the world — and we’re seeing the impulse to restrict speech and enforce new norms around what people can say.", "Increasingly, we’re seeing people try to define more speech as dangerous because it may lead to political outcomes they see as unacceptable.", "Some hold the view that since the stakes are so high, they can no longer trust their fellow citizens with the power to communicate and decide what to believe for themselves.", "I personally believe this is more dangerous for democracy over the long term than almost any speech. Democracy depends on the idea that we hold each others’ right to express ourselves and be heard above our own desire to always get the outcomes we want.", "You can’t impose tolerance top-down. It has to come from people opening up, sharing experiences, and developing a shared story for society that we all feel we’re a part of.", "So how do we turn the tide? Someone once told me our founding fathers thought free expression was like air.", "You don’t miss it until it’s gone. When people don’t feel they can express themselves, they lose faith in democracy and they’re more likely to support populist parties that prioritize specific policy goals over the health of our democratic norms.", "I’m a little more optimistic. I don’t think we need to lose our freedom of expression to realize how important it is.", "I think people understand and appreciate the voice they have now. At some fundamental level, I think most people believe in their fellow people too.", "As long as our governments respect people’s right to express themselves, as long as our platforms live up to their responsibilities to support expression and prevent harm, and as long as we all commit to being open and making space for more perspectives, I think we’ll make progress.", "It’ll take time, but we’ll work through this moment. We overcame deep polarization after World War I, and intense political violence in the 1960s.", "Progress isn’t linear. Sometimes we take two steps forward and one step back. But if we can’t agree to let each other talk about the issues, we can’t take the first step.", "Even when it’s hard, this is how we build a shared understanding.", "So yes, we have big disagreements. Maybe more now than at any time in recent history. But part of that is because we’re getting our issues out on the table — issues that for a long time weren’t talked about.", "More people from more parts of our society have a voice than ever before, and it will take time to hear these voices and knit them together into a coherent narrative.", "Sometimes we hope for a singular event to resolve these conflicts, but that’s never been how it works.", "We focus on the major institutions — from governments to large companies — but the bigger story has always been regular people using their voice to take billions of individual steps forward to make our lives and our communities better.", "The future depends on all of us. Whether you like Facebook or not, we need to recognize what is at stake and come together to stand for free expression at this critical moment.", "I believe in giving people a voice because, at the end of the day, I believe in people. And as long as enough of us keep fighting for this, I believe that more people’s voices will eventually help us work through these issues together and write a new chapter in our history — where from all of our individual voices and perspectives, we can bring the world closer together."]}

Having got his start as a programmer with a nocturnal bent, he is also not a morning person.", "Walking toward the kitchen, which has a long farmhouse table and cabinets painted forest green, he said, “I haven’t eaten breakfast yet.", "Since 2011, Zuckerberg has lived in a century-old white clapboard Craftsman in the Crescent Park neighborhood, an enclave of giant oaks and historic homes not far from Stanford University.", "The house, which cost seven million dollars, affords him a sense of sanctuary. It’s set back from the road, shielded by hedges, a wall, and mature trees.", "Guests enter through an arched wooden gate and follow a long gravel path to a front lawn with a saltwater pool in the center.", "The year after Zuckerberg bought the house, he and his longtime girlfriend, Priscilla Chan, held their wedding in the back yard, which encompasses gardens, a pond, and a shaded pavilion.", "Since then, they have had two children, and acquired a seven-hundred-acre estate in Hawaii, a ski retreat in Montana, and a four-story town house on Liberty Hill, in San Francisco.", "But the family’s full-time residence is here, a ten-minute drive from Facebook’s headquarters.", "Occasionally, Zuckerberg records a Facebook video from the back yard or the dinner table, as is expected of a man who built his fortune exhorting employees to keep “pushing the world in the direction of making it a more open and transparent place.”", "But his appetite for personal openness is limited. Although Zuckerberg is the most famous entrepreneur of his generation, he remains elusive to everyone but a small circle of family and friends, and his efforts to protect his privacy inevitably attract attention.", "The local press has chronicled his feud with a developer who announced plans to build a mansion that would look into Zuckerberg’s master bedroom.", "After a legal fight, the developer gave up, and Zuckerberg spent forty-four million dollars to buy the houses surrounding his.", "Over the years, he has come to believe that he will always be the subject of criticism. “We’re not—pick your noncontroversial business—selling dog food, although I think that people who do that probably say there is controversy in that, too, but this is an inherently cultural thing,” he told me, of his business.", "“It’s at the intersection of technology and psychology, and it’s very personal.”", "He carried a plate of banana bread and a carafe of water into the living room, and settled onto a navy-blue velvet sofa.", "Since co-founding Facebook, in 2004, his uniform has evolved from hoodies and flip-flops to his current outfit, a gray sweater, indigo jeans, and black Nikes.", "At thirty-four, Zuckerberg, who has very fair skin, a tall forehead, and large eyes, is leaner than when he first became a public figure, more than a decade ago.", "On the porch, next to the front door, he keeps a Peloton stationary bike, a favorite accessory in the tech world, which live-streams a personal trainer to your home.", "Zuckerberg uses the machine, but he does not love cycling. A few years ago, on his first attempt to use a road bike with racing pedals, he forgot to unclip, tipped over, and broke his arm.", "Except for cycling on his porch, he said, “I haven’t clipped in since.”", "He and his wife prefer board games to television, and, within reach of the couch, I noticed a game called Ricochet Robots.", "“It gets extremely competitive,” Zuckerberg said. “We play with these friends, and one of them is a genius at this.", "Playing with him is just infuriating.” Dave Morin, a former Facebook employee who is the founder and C.E.O. of Sunrise Bio, a startup seeking cures for depression, used to play Risk with Zuckerberg at the office.", "“He’s not playing you in a game of Risk. He’s playing you in a game of games,” Morin told me. “The first game, he might amass all his armies on one property, and the next game he might spread them all over the place.", "He’s trying to figure out the psychological way to beat you in all the games.”", "Across the tech industry, the depth of Zuckerberg’s desire to win is often remarked upon. Dick Costolo, the former C.E.O. of Twitter, told me, “He’s a ruthless execution machine, and if he has decided to come after you, you’re going to take a beating.”", "Reid Hoffman, the founder of LinkedIn, said, “There are a number of people in the Valley who have a perception of Mark that he’s really aggressive and competitive.", "I think some people are a little hesitant about him from that perspective.” Hoffman has been an investor in Facebook since its early days, but for a long time he sensed that Zuckerberg kept his distance because they were both building social networks.", "“For many years, it was, like, ‘Your LinkedIn thing is going to be crushed, so even though we’re friendly, I don’t want to get too close to you personally, because I’m going to crush you.’", "Now, of course, that’s behind us and we’re good friends.”", "When I asked Zuckerberg about this reputation, he framed the dynamic differently. The survival of any social-media business rests on “network effects,” in which the value of the network grows only by finding new users.", "As a result, he said, “there’s a natural zero-sumness. If we’re going to achieve what we want to, it’s not just about building the best features.", "It’s about building the best community.” He added, “I care about succeeding. And, yes, sometimes you have to beat someone to something, in order to get to the next thing.", "But that’s not primarily the way that I think I roll.”", "For many years, Zuckerberg ended Facebook meetings with the half-joking exhortation “Domination!” Although he eventually stopped doing this (in European legal systems, “dominance” refers to corporate monopoly), his discomfort with losing is undimmed.", "A few years ago, he played Scrabble on a corporate jet with a friend’s daughter, who was in high school at the time.", "She won. Before they played a second game, he wrote a simple computer program that would look up his letters in the dictionary so that he could choose from all possible words.", "Zuckerberg’s program had a narrow lead when the flight landed. The girl told me, “During the game in which I was playing the program, everyone around us was taking sides: Team Human and Team Machine.”", "If Facebook were a country, it would have the largest population on earth. More than 2.2 billion people, about a third of humanity, log in at least once a month.", "That user base has no precedent in the history of American enterprise.

On Wednesday afternoon, though, he addressed the problem in a personal Facebook post and laid out some of the solutions he will introduce.", "He then gave an interview to WIRED in which he discussed the recent crisis, the mistakes Facebook made, and different models for how the company could be regulated.", "He also discussed the possibility that another—Russian—shoe could drop. Here is a transcript of that conversation:", "Nicholas Thompson: You learned about the Cambridge Analytica breach in late 2015, and you got them to sign a legal document saying the Facebook data they had misappropriated had been deleted.", "But in the two years since, there were all kinds of stories in the press that could have made one doubt and mistrust them.", "Why didn’t you dig deeper to see if they had misused Facebook data?", "Mark Zuckerberg: So in 2015, when we heard from journalists at The Guardian that Aleksandr Kogan seemed to have shared data with Cambridge Analytica and a few other parties, the immediate actions that we took were to ban Kogan’s app and to demand a legal certification from Kogan and all the other folks who he shared it with.", "We got those certifications, and Cambridge Analytica had actually told us that they actually hadn’t received raw Facebook data at all.", "It was some kind of derivative data, but they had deleted it and weren’t [making] any use of it.", "In retrospect, though, I think that what you’re pointing out here is one of the biggest mistakes that we made.", "And that’s why the first action that we now need to go take is to not just rely on certifications that we’ve gotten from developers, but [we] actually need to go and do a full investigation of every single app that was operating before we had the more restrictive platform policies—that had access to a lot of data—and for any app that has any suspicious activity, we’re going to go in and do a full forensic audit.", "And any developer who won’t sign up for that we’re going to kick off the platform. So, yes, I think the short answer to this is that's the step that I think we should have done for Cambridge Analytica, and we’re now going to go do it for every developer who is on the platform who had access to a large amount of data before we locked things down in 2014.", "NT: OK, great. I did write a piece this week saying I thought that was the main mistake Facebook made.", "MZ: The good news here is that the big actions that we needed to take to prevent this from happening today we took three or four years ago.", "But had we taken them five or six years ago, we wouldn’t be here right now. So I do think early on on the platform we had this very idealistic vision around how data portability would allow all these different new experiences, and I think the feedback that we’ve gotten from our community and from the world is that privacy and having the data locked down is more important to people than maybe making it easier to bring more data and have different kinds of experiences.", "And I think if we’d internalized that sooner and had made these changes that we made in 2014 in, say, 2012 or 2010 then I also think we could have avoided a lot of harm.", "NT: And that’s a super interesting philosophical change, because what interests me the most about this story is that there are hard tradeoffs in everything.", "The critique of Facebook two weeks ago was that you need to be more open with your data, and now it’s that certain data needs to be closed off.", "You can encrypt data more, but if you encrypt data more it makes it less useful. So tell me the other philosophical changes that have been going through your mind during the past 72 hours as you’ve been digging into this.", "MZ: Well that’s the big one, but I think that that’s been decided pretty clearly at this point. I think the feedback that we’ve gotten from people—not only in this episode but for years—is that people value having less access to their data above having the ability to more easily bring social experiences with their friends’ data to other places.", "And I don’t know, I mean, part of that might be philosophical, it may just be in practice what developers are able to build over the platform, and the practical value exchange, that’s certainly been a big one.", "And I agree. I think at the heart of a lot of these issues we face are tradeoffs between real values that people care about.", "You know, when you think about issues like fake news or hate speech, right, it’s a tradeoff between free speech and free expression and safety and having an informed community.", "These are all the challenging situations that I think we are working to try to navigate as best we can.", "NT: So is it safe to assume that, as you went through the process over the past few days, you’ve been talking about the tradeoffs, looking at a wide range of solutions, and you picked four or five of them that are really good, that are solid, that few people are going to dispute?", "But that there’s a whole other suite of changes that are more complicated that we may hear about from you in the next few weeks?", "MZ: There are definitely other things that we’re thinking about that are longer term. But there’s also a lot of nuance on this, right?", "So there are probably 15 changes that we’re making to the platform to further restrict data, and I didn’t list them all, because a lot of them are kind of nuanced and hard to explain—so I kind of tried to paint in broad strokes what the issues are, which were first, going forward, making sure developers can’t get access to this kind of data.", "The good news there is that the most important changes there had been made in 2014. But there are still several other things that, upon examination, it made sense to do now.", "And then the other is just that we want to make sure that there aren’t other Cambridge Analyticas out there.", "And if they were able to skate by giving us, say, fraudulent legal certification, I just think our responsibility to our community is greater than to just rely on that from a bunch of different actors who might have signals, as you say, of doing suspicious things.", "So I think our responsibility is to now go and look at every single app and to, any time there’s anything suspicious, get into more detail and do a full audit of them.", "NT: Got it. We’re learning a lot every day about Cambridge Analytica, and we’re learning what they did.", "How confident are you that Facebook data didn’t get into the hands of Russian operatives—into the Internet Research Agency, or even into other groups that we may not have found yet?", "MZ: I can’t really say that. I hope that we will know that more certainly after we do an audit. You know, for what it’s worth on this, the report in 2015 was that Kogan had shared data with Cambridge Analytica and others.", "When we demanded the certification from Cambridge Analytica, what they came back with was saying: Actually, we never actually received raw Facebook data.", "We got maybe some personality scores or some derivative data from Kogan, but actually that wasn’t useful in any of the models, so we’d already deleted it and weren't using it in anything.", "So yes, we’ll basically confirm that we’ll fully expunge it all and be done with this.", "So I’m not actually sure where this is going to go. I certainly think the New York Times and Guardian and Channel 4 reports that we received last week suggested that Cambridge Analytica still had access to the data.", "I mean, those sounded credible enough that we needed to take major action based on it. But, you know, I don’t want to jump to conclusions about what is going to be turned up once we complete this audit.", "And the other thing I’d say is that we have temporarily paused the audit to cede to the UK regulator, the ICO [Information Commissioner's Office], so that they can do a government investigation—I think it might be a criminal investigation, but it’s a government investigation at a minimum.", "So we’ll let them go first. But we certainly want to make sure that we understand how all this data was used and fully confirm that no Facebook community data is out there.", "NT: But presumably there’s a second level of analysis you could do, which would be to look at the known stuff from the Internet Research Agency, to look at data signatures from files you know Kogan had, and to see through your own data, not through the audited data, whether there’s a potential that that information was passed to the IRA.", "MZ: You know, we’ve certainly looked into the IRA’s ad spending and use in a lot of detail. The data that Kogan’s app got, it wasn’t watermarked in any way.", "And if he passed along data to Cambridge Analytica that was some kind of derivative data based on personality scores or something, we wouldn’t have known that, or ever seen that data.", "So it would be hard to do that analysis. But we’re certainly looking into what the IRA did on an ongoing basis.", "The more important thing, though, that I think we’re doing there is just trying to make the sure government has all the access to the content that they need.", "So they've given us certain warrants, we’re cooperating as much as we can with those investigations, and my view, at least, is that the US government and special counsel are going to have a much broader view of all the different signals in the system than we’re going to—including, for example, money transfers and things like that that we just won’t have access to be able to understand.", "So I think that that’s probably the best bet of coming up with a link like that. And nothing that we’ve done internally so far has found a link—doesn’t mean that there isn’t one—but we haven’t identified any.", "NT: Speaking of Congress, there are a lot of questions about whether you will go and testify voluntarily, or whether you’ll be asked in a more formal sense than a tweet.", "MZ: So, here’s how we think about this. Facebook regularly testifies before Congress on a number of topics, most of which are not as high profile as the Russia investigation one recently.", "And our philosophy on this is: Our job is to get the government and Congress as much information as we can about anything that we know so they have a full picture, across companies, across the intelligence community, they can put that together and do what they need to do.", "So, if it is ever the case that I am the most informed person at Facebook in the best position to testify, I will happily do that.", "But the reason why we haven’t done that so far is because there are people at the company whose full jobs are to deal with legal compliance or some of these different things, and they’re just fundamentally more in the details on those things.", "So as long as it’s a substantive testimony where what folks are trying to get is as much content as possible, I’m not sure when I’ll be the right person.", "NT: OK. When you think about regulatory models, there’s a whole spectrum. There are kind of simple, limited things, like the Honest Ads Act, which would be more openness on ads.", "There’s the much more intense German model, or what France has certainly talked about. Or there's the ultimate extreme, like Sri Lanka, which just shut social media down.", "So when you think about the different models for regulation, how do you think about what would be good for Facebook, for its users, and for civic society?", "MZ: Well, I mean, I think you’re framing this the right away, because the question isn’t “Should there be regulation or shouldn’t there be?”", "It’s “How do you do it?” And some of the ones, I think, are more straightforward. So take the Honest Ads Act.", "Most of the stuff in there, from what I’ve seen, is good. We support it. We’re building full ad transparency tools; even though it doesn’t necessarily seem like that specific bill is going to pass, we’re going to go implement most of it anyway.", "And that’s just because I think it will end up being good for our community and good for the internet if internet services live up to a lot of the same standards, and even go further than TV and traditional media have had to in advertising—that just seems logical.", "There are some really nuanced questions, though, about how to regulate which I think are extremely interesting intellectually.", "So the biggest one that I’ve been thinking about is this question of: To what extent should companies have a responsibility to use AI tools to kind of self-regulate content?", "Here, let me kind of take a step back on this. When we got started in 2004 in a dorm room, there were two big differences about how we governed content on the service.", "Basically, back then people shared stuff and then they flagged it and we tried to look at it. But no one was saying, \"Hey, you should be able to proactively know every time someone posts something bad,\" because the AI tech was much less evolved, and we were a couple of people in a dorm room.", "So I think people understood that we didn’t have a full operation that can go deal with this. But now you fast-forward almost 15 years and AI is not solved, but it is improving to the point where we can proactively identify a lot of content—not all of it, you know; some really nuanced hate speech and bullying, it’s still going to be years before we can get at—but, you know, nudity, a lot of terrorist content, we can proactively determine a lot of the time.", "And at the same time we’re a successful enough company that we can employ 15,000 people to work on security and all of the different forms of community [operations].", "So I think there’s this really interesting question of: Now that companies increasingly over the next five to 10 years, as AI tools get better and better, will be able to proactively determine what might be offensive content or violate some rules, what therefore is the responsibility and legal responsibility of companies to do that?", "That, I think, is probably one of the most interesting intellectual and social debates around how you regulate this.", "I don’t know that it’s going to look like the US model with Honest Ads or any of the specific models that you brought up, but I think that getting that right is going to be one of the key things for the internet and AI going forward.", "NT: So how does government even get close to getting that right, given that it takes years to make laws and then they’re in place for more years, and AI will be completely different in two years from what it is now?", "Do they just set you guidelines? Do they require a certain amount of transparency? What can be done, or what can the government do, to help guide you in this process?", "MZ: I actually think it’s both of the things that you just said. So I think what tends to work well are transparency, which I think is an area where we need to do a lot better and are working on that and are going to have a number of big announcements this year, over the course of the year, about transparency around content.", "And I think guidelines are much better than dictating specific processes.", "So my understanding with food safety is there’s a certain amount of dust that can get into the chicken as it’s going through the processing, and it’s not a large amount—it needs to be a very small amount—and I think there’s some understanding that you’re not going to be able to fully solve every single issue if you’re trying to feed hundreds of millions of people—or, in our case, build a community of 2 billion people—but that it should be a very high standard, and people should expect that we’re going to do a good job getting the hate speech out.", "And that, I think, is probably the right way to do it—to give companies the right flexibility in how to execute that.", "I think when you start getting into micromanagement, of “Oh, you need to have this specific queue or this,” which I think what you were saying is the German model—you have to handle hate speech in this way—in some ways that’s actually backfired.", "Because now we are handling hate speech in Germany in a specific way, for Germany, and our processes for the rest of the world have far surpassed our ability to handle, to do that.", "But we’re still doing it in Germany the way that it’s mandated that we do it there. So I think guidelines are probably going to be a lot better.", "But this, I think, is going to be an interesting conversation to have over the coming years, maybe, more than today.", "NT: Last question. You’ve had a lot of big changes: The meaningful interactions was a huge change; the changes in the ways that you’ve found and stopped the spread of misinformation; the changes today, in the way you work with developers.", "Big changes, right. Lots of stuff happening. When you think back at how you set up Facebook, are there things, choices, directional choices, you wish you had done a little differently that would have prevented us from being in this situation?", "MZ: I don’t know; that’s tough. To some degree, if the community—if we hadn’t served a lot of people, then I think that some of this stuff would be less relevant.", "But that’s not a change I would want to go back and reverse. You know, I think the world is changing quickly.", "And I think social norms are changing quickly, and people’s definitions around what is hate speech, what is false news—which is a concept people weren’t as focused on before a couple of years ago—people’s trust and fear of governments and different institutions is rapidly evolving, and I think when you’re trying to build services for a community of 2 billion people all over the world, with different social norms, I think it’s pretty unlikely that you can navigate that in a way where you’re not going to face some thorny tradeoffs between values, and need to shift and adjust your systems, and do a better job on a lot of stuff.", "So I don’t begrudge that. I think that we have a serious responsibility. I want to make sure that we take it as seriously as it should be taken.", "I’m grateful for the feedback that we get from journalists who criticize us and teach us important things about what we need to do, because we need to get this right.", "It’s important. There’s no way that sitting in a dorm in 2004 you’re going to solve everything upfront.", "It’s an inherently iterative process, so I don’t tend to look at these things as: Oh, I wish we had not made that mistake.", "I mean, of course I wish we didn’t make the mistakes, but it wouldn’t be possible to avoid the mistakes.", "It’s just about, how do you learn from that and improve things and try to serve the community going forward?", "- After days of silence about the Cambridge Analytica controversy, Mark Zuckerberg authored a Facebook post.", "- Facebook has struggled to respond to the revelations about Cambridge Analytica.", "- Read the WIRED story about the past two years of struggles inside Facebook."]}

And instead of just giving a lot of long speeches I want to make sure that we’ve got time for as many questions as possible.", "MR. ZUCKERBERG: Yes, let’s start off. So let’s start off with the conversation about the debt. So I understand that yesterday morning you had a town hall in Virginia where you talked about your framework not only for resolving the short-term budget issues, but the longer-term debt.", "And you spent some time talking about tax reform and some cost cutting, but you also spent a lot of time talking about things that you didn’t think that we could cut -- in education, infrastructure and clean energy.", "So my question to kind of start off is: What specifically do you think we should do, and what specifically do you think we can cut in order to make this all add up?", "THE PRESIDENT: Well, let me, first of all, Mark, share with you sort of the nature of the problem, because I think a lot of folks understand that it’s a problem but aren’t sure how it came about.", "In 2000, at the end of the Clinton administration, we not only had a balanced budget but we actually had a surplus.", "And that was in part because of some tough decisions that had been made by President Clinton, Republican Congresses, Democratic Congresses, and President George H.W. Bush.", "And what they had said was let’s make sure that we’re spending wisely on the things that matter; let’s spend less on things that don’t matter; and let’s make sure that we’re living within our means, that we’re taking in enough revenue to pay for some of these basic obligations.", "What happened then was we went through 10 years where we forgot what had created the surplus in the first place.", "So we had a massive tax cut that wasn’t offset by cuts in spending. We had two wars that weren’t paid for.", "And this was the first time in history where we had gone to war and not asked for additional sacrifice from American citizens.", "We had a huge prescription drug plan that wasn’t paid for.", "And so by the time I started office we already had about a trillion-dollar annual deficit and we had massive accumulated debt with interest payments to boot.", "Then you have this huge recession. And so what happens is less revenue is coming in -- because company sales are lower, individuals are making less money -- at the same time there’s more need out there.", "So we’re having to help states and we’re having to help local governments.", "And that -- a lot of what the recovery was about was us making sure that the economy didn’t tilt over into a depression by making sure that teachers weren’t laid off and firefighters weren’t laid off, and there was still construction for roads and so forth -- all of which was expensive.", "I mean, that added about another trillion dollars worth of debt.", "So now what we’ve got is a situation not only do we have this accumulated debt, but the baby boomers are just now starting to retire.", "And what’s scary is not only that the baby boomers are retiring at a greater rate, which means they're making greater demands on Social Security, but primarily Medicare and Medicaid, but health care costs go up a lot faster than inflation and older populations use more health care costs.", "You put that all together, and we have an unsustainable situation.", "So right now we face a critical time where we’re going to have to make some decisions how do we bring down the debt in the short term, and how do we bring down the debt over the long term.", "In the short term, Democrats and Republicans now agree we’ve got to reduce the debt by about $4 trillion over the next 10 years.", "And I know that sounds like a lot of money -- it is. But it’s doable if we do it in a balanced way.", "What I proposed was that about $2 trillion over 10 to 12 years is reduction in spending. Government wastes, just like every other major institution does, and so there are things that we do that we can afford not to do.", "Now, there are some things that I’d like to do, are fun to do, but we just can’t afford them right now.", "So we’ve made cuts in every area. A good example is Pentagon spending, where Congress oftentimes stuffs weapons systems in the Pentagon budget that the Pentagon itself says we don’t need.", "But special interests and constituencies helped to bloat the Pentagon budget. So we’ve already reduced the Pentagon budget by about $400 billion.", "So we’ve got to look at spending both on non-security issues as well as defense spending. And then what we’ve said is let’s take another trillion of that that we raise through a reform in the tax system that allows people like me -- and, frankly, you, Mark -- for paying a little more in taxes.", "THE PRESIDENT: I know you’re okay with that. (Laughter.) Keep in mind, what we’re talking about is going back to the rates that existed when Bill Clinton was President.", "Now, a lot of you were -- (laughter) -- I’m trying to say this delicately -- still in diapers at that time.", "(Laughter.) But for those of you who recall, the economy was booming, and wealthy people were getting wealthier.", "There wasn’t a problem at that time. If we go back to those rates alone, that by itself would do a lot in terms of us reducing our overall spending.", "And if we can get a trillion dollars on the revenue side, $2 trillion in cutting spending, we can still make investments in basic research.", "We can still invest in something we call ARPA-E, which is like DARPA except just focused on energy, so that we can figure out what are the next breakthrough technologies that can help us reduce our reliance on fossil fuels.", "We can still make investments in education, so we’ve already expanded the Pell Grant program so that more young people can go to college.", "We’re investing more in STEM education -- math and science and technology education. We can still make those investments.", "We can still rebuild our roads and our bridges, and invest in high-speed rail, and invest in the next generation of broadband and wireless, and make sure everybody has access to the Internet.", "We can do all those things while still bringing down the deficit medium term.", "Now, there’s one last component of this -- and I know this is a long answer but I wanted to make sure everybody had the basic foundations for it.", "Even if we get this $4 trillion, we do still have a long-term problem with Medicare and Medicaid, because health care costs, the inflation goes up so much faster than wages and salaries.", "And this is where there’s another big philosophical debate with the Republicans, because what I’ve said is the best way for us to change it is to build on the health reform we had last year and start getting a better bang for our health care dollar.", "We waste so much on health care. We spend about 20 percent more than any other country on Earth, and we have worse outcomes because we end up having multiple tests when we could just do one test and have it shared among physicians on Facebook, for example.", "We could focus on the chronically ill; 20 percent of the patients account for 80 percent of the costs.", "So doing something simple like reimbursing hospitals and doctors for reducing their readmissions rate, and managing somebody with a chronic illness like diabetes so that they're taking their meds on a regular basis so that they don't come to the emergency room, that saves huge amounts of money.", "So that's what health care reform was about last year or a year and a half ago, and what we want to do is build on that and continue to improve the system.", "What the Republicans right now are saying is, number one, they can't agree to any increases in taxes, which means we’d have to cut out -- of that $4 trillion, all of it would come from education, transportation -- areas that I think are critical for our long-term future.", "So, for example, they proposed 70 percent cuts in clean energy. Well, I don't know how we free ourselves from dependence on foreign oil -- and anybody who is paying gas prices knows that there’s an economic component to this as well as an environmental component to it -- if we’re not investing in the basic research and technology that allows solar, wind and others to thrive and develop.", "At the same time, what they’ve said is let’s make Medicare into a voucher program, so that retirees, instead of knowing that they're always going to have health care, they're going to get a voucher that covers part of the cost, and whatever health care inflation comes up is all going to be on them.", "And if the health insurance companies don't sell you a policy that covers your illnesses, you’re out of luck.", "I think it is very important for us to have a basic social safety net for families with kids with disabilities, for seniors, for folks who are in nursing homes, and I think it’s important for us to invest in our basic research.", "We can do all those things, but we’re only going to be able to do it by taking a balanced approach. And that's what this big debate is about -- all about right now.", "MR. ZUCKERBERG: All right, so -- sorry, don't mean to cut off the applause. (Applause.)", "THE PRESIDENT: No, they were -- they were stunned by the length of that answer. (Laughter.) But it’s complicated stuff.", "MR. ZUCKERBERG: So the next question is from someone watching Facebook live. Jay Aptine (ph) from Williamsburg, Virginia writes in and asks: “The housing crisis will not go away.", "The mortgage financing for new homebuyers with low to moderate income is becoming very difficult. As President, what can you do to relax the policies that are disqualifying qualified homebuyers from owning their first home?", "How can you assure the low to moderate homebuyers that they will have the opportunity to own their first home?”", "THE PRESIDENT: Well, it’s a good question. And I’ll be honest with you, this is probably the biggest drag on the economy right now that we have -- along with I know the frustrations people have about gas prices.", "What we’ve really seen is the housing market, which was a bubble, had greatly over-inflated in all regions of the country.", "And I know I probably don't get a lot of sympathy about that here because I can only imagine what rents and mortgages you guys are paying.", "It is a real drag in all sorts of ways. People, first of all, they feel poorer even if they still have a home or they’ve already purchased a home, because for a lot of folks their mortgage is now what’s called underwater.", "The mortgage is more than the home is worth. And so if you feel like your most important asset is now worth less than your debt, that's going to constrain how you spend.", "People who want to move have a great deal of trouble selling, and people who want to buy, as you pointed out, are seeing terms a lot more restrictive.", "So we've put in place a bunch of programs to try to see if we can speed along the process of reaching a new equilibrium.", "For example, what we did is we went to the mortgage lender and said, why don't you renegotiate with your mortgage -- with the person with the mortgage, renegotiate the terms of their mortgage so that their principal is a little bit lower, they can afford the payments, and that way homes don't get foreclosed on, there are fewer homes on the market, and that will raise prices and that will be good for everybody.", "And we've seen some significant progress on that front.", "The challenge we still have, as your questioner properly points out, is that a lot of people who bought a first home when credit was easy now are finding that credit is tough.", "And we've got to strike a balance. Frankly, there’s some folks who are probably better off renting. And what we don't want to do is return to a situation where people are putting no money down and they’ve got very easy payment terms at the front end", "and then it turns out five years from now, because they’ve got an adjustable rate mortgage, that they couldn't afford it and they lose their home.", "I think the regulators are trying to get that balance right. There are certain communities with high foreclosure rates where what we're trying to do is see if can we help state and local governments take over some of these homes and convert them and provide favorable terms to first-time home buyers.", "But, frankly, I think we've got to understand that the days where it was really easy to buy a house without any money down is probably over.", "And what we -- what I'm really concerned about is making sure that the housing market overall recovers enough that it’s not such a huge drag on the economy, because if it isn’t, then people will have more confidence, they’ll spend more, more people will get hired, and overall the economy will improve.", "But I recognize for a lot of folks who want to be first-time homebuyers it’s still tough out there. It’s getting better in certain areas, but in some places, particularly where there was a big housing bubble, it’s not.", "MR. ZUCKERBERG: So I think the next question is from a Facebook employee in the room today. So Lauren Hale has a question.", "Q Hi, Mr. President. Thank you so much for joining us today. I am originally from Detroit, Michigan, and now I'm out here working at Facebook.", "So my question for you kind of builds on some of the things we were just talking about. At the beginning of your term you spent a lot of time talking about job creation and the road to economic recovery, and one of the ways to do that would be substantially increasing federal investments in various areas as a way to fill the void left from consumer spending.", "Since then, we’ve seen the conversation shift from that of job creation and economic recovery to that of spending cuts and the deficit.", "So I would love to know your thoughts on how you’re going to balance these two going forward, or even potentially shift the conversation back.", "THE PRESIDENT: Well, you’re exactly right that when I first came into office our number-one job was preventing us from getting into another Great Depression.", "And that was what the Recovery Act was all about. So we helped states make sure that they could minimize some of the layoffs and some of the difficult budget choices that they faced.", "We made sure that we had infrastructure spending all around the country. And, in fact, we made the biggest investment in infrastructure since Dwight Eisenhower built the Interstate Highway System.", "We made the largest investment in history in clean energy research, and it’s really paying off. For example, when I came into office, we had about 2 percent of the advanced battery manufacturing here in America.", "And as everybody here knows, what’s really holding us back from my goal of a million electric vehicles on the road is that battery technology is still tough.", "It’s clunky; it’s heavy; it’s expensive. And if we can make significant improvements in battery technology then I think the opportunities for electric vehicles, alternative vehicles that are much cheaper -- our opportunities are limitless.", "So those were all investments that we made in the first two years. Now, the economy is now growing. It’s not growing quite as fast as we would like, because after a financial crisis, typically there’s a bigger drag on the economy for a longer period of time.", "But it is growing. And over the last year and a half we’ve seen almost 2 million jobs created in the private sector.", "Because this recession came at a time when we were already deeply in debt and it made the debt worse, if we don’t have a serious plan to tackle the debt and the deficit, that could actually end up being a bigger drag on the economy than anything else.", "If the markets start feeling that we’re not serious about the problem, and if you start seeing investors feel uncertain about the future, then they could pull back right at the time when the economy is taking off.", "So you’re right that it’s tricky. Folks around here are used to the hills in San Francisco, and you’ve driven -- I don’t know if they still have clutch cars around here.", "Anybody every driven a clutch car? (Laughter.) I mean, you got to sort of tap and -- well, that’s sort of what we faced in terms of the economy, right?", "We got to hit the accelerator, but we’ve got to also make sure that we don’t gun it; we can’t let the car slip backwards.", "And so what we’re trying to do then is put together a debt and deficit plan that doesn’t slash spending so drastically that we can’t still make investments in education, that we can’t still make investments in infrastructure -- all of which would help the economy grow.", "In December, we passed a targeted tax cut for business investment, as well as the payroll tax that has a stimulus effect that helps to grow the economy.", "We can do those things and still grow the economy while having a plan in place to reduce the deficit, first by 2015, and then over the long term.", "So I think we can do both, but it does require the balanced approach that I was talking about.", "If all we’re doing is spending cuts and we’re not discriminating about it, if we’re using a machete instead of a scalpel", "and we’re cutting out things that create jobs, then the deficit could actually get worse because we could slip back into another recession.", "And obviously for folks in Detroit, where you’re from, they know that our investments can make a difference because we essentially saved the U.S. auto industry.", "We now have three auto companies here in America that are all turning a profit. G.M. just announced that it’s hiring back all of the workers that it was planning to lay off.", "And we did so, by the way, at the same time as we were able to increase fuel efficiency standards on cars for the first time in 30 years.", "So it can be done, but it takes a balanced approach. (Applause.)", "MR. ZUCKERBERG: All right, so we have a question from the University of Florida, where in February, you launched this initiative at Whitehouse.gov, younger Americans with this goal to have a hundred youth roundtables across the country and a bunch of them are taking place right now, watching this Facebook live.", "So Cesar Fernandez (ph) and Elisa Rectanas (ph) are participating in one of those roundtables, and they wanted to ask you this: “Mr. President, in your deficit reduction speech last week you spoke of the need to not only reduce government spending but to also increase federal revenue.", "In light of our nation’s budget challenges, will your administration consider revisiting policies such as the DREAM Act, which the Congressional Budget Office estimates will reduce the deficit by $1.4 billion and increase the government revenue by $2.3 billion over the next 10 years?”", "THE PRESIDENT: Let me talk about not only the DREAM Act but about immigration policy generally. And I want to thank -- Sheryl Sandberg actually participated in a discussion that we had yesterday, bringing together business leaders and government officials and faith leaders, a broad cross-section of Americans together to talk about how do we finally fix an immigration system that's fundamentally broken.", "For those of you who aren’t familiar, the DREAM Act is -- deals with a particular portion of the population, kids who were brought here when they were young by their parents; their parents might have come here illegally -- the kids didn't do anything.", "They were just doing what kids do, which is follow their parents. They’ve grown up as Americans. They went to school with us or with our kids.", "They think of themselves as Americans, but many of them still don't have a legal status.", "And so what we’ve said is, especially for these young people who are our neighbors, our friends, our children’s friends, if they are of good character and going to school or joining our military, they want to be part of the American family, why wouldn’t we want to embrace them?", "Why wouldn’t we want to make sure that -- (applause.) Why wouldn’t we want to make sure that they're contributing to our future?", "So that's the DREAM Act. But that's just a small part of a broader challenge that we have. Immigration in this country has always been complicated.", "The truth of the matter is that we are both a nation of immigrants and a nation of laws. Sometimes the laws haven’t been fair.", "Sometimes the laws have been restrictive to certain ethnic groups. There have been quotas. Sometimes our immigration policies have been arbitrary and have been determined by whether industry at a particular time was willing to bring in workers on the cheap.", "But what’s undeniable is America is a nation of immigrants. That’s our history and that’s what makes us stronger.", "Because we’ve got ambitious people from all around the world who come here because they’ve got a new idea and they want to create the new big thing, or they just want a better future for their kids and their family, and that dynamism is part of what’s propelled our progress and kept us young.", "Now, I think most Americans understand that and most Americans agree with that. At the same time, I think most Americans feel there should be an orderly process to do it.", "People shouldn’t just be coming here and cutting in front of the line, essentially, and staying without having gone through the proper channels.", "So what we’ve said is let’s fix the whole system. First of all, let’s make the legal immigration system more fair than it is and more efficient than it is.", "And that includes, by the way, something I know that is of great concern here in Silicon Valley. If we’ve got smart people who want to come here and start businesses and are PhDs in math and science and computer science, why don’t we want them to say?", "(Applause.) I mean, why would we want to send them someplace else? (Applause.)", "So those are potential job creators. Those are job generators. I think about somebody like an Andy Grove of Intel.", "We want more Andy Groves here in the United States. We don’t want them starting companies -- we don’t want them starting Intel in China or starting it in France.", "So there’s a lot that we can do for making sure that high-skilled immigrants who come here, study -- we’ve paid for their college degrees, we’ve given them scholarships, we’ve given them this training -- let’s make sure that if they want to reinvest and make their future here in America that they can.", "But point number two is you also have a lot of unskilled workers who are now here who are living in the shadows.", "They’re contributing to our economy in all sorts of ways. They’re working in the agricultural sector.", "They are in restaurants, and they’re in communities all across the country looking after children and helping to building America.", "But they’re scared, and they feel as if they’re locked out of their surroundings.", "And what I’ve said is they did break the law; they came here -- they have to take responsibility for that.", "They should pay a fine. They should learn English. They should go to the back of the line so that they don’t automatically get citizenship.", "But there should be a pathway for them to get legalized in our society so they don’t fear for themselves or their families, so that families aren’t separated.", "At the same time, let’s make sure we’ve got a secure border so that folks aren’t wandering through the desert to get here.", "Let’s make the legal immigration system more efficient and more effective so there aren’t huge backlogs.", "This is all part of what we call comprehensive immigration reform. And there’s no reason why we shouldn’t be able to achieve a system that is fair, is equitable, is an economic engine for America that helps the people who are already here get acculturated, and make sure that our laws aren’t being broken but we’re still true to our traditions.", "But, as I mentioned to Sheryl yesterday, I can’t solve this problem by myself. Nancy Pelosi is a big champion of this.", "The Democratic caucus in the House I think is prepared for -- a majority of them are prepared to advance comprehensive immigration reform.", "But we’re going to have to have bipartisan support in order to make it happen. And all of you have to make sure your voices are heard, saying this is a priority, this is something important -- because if politicians don’t hear from you, then it probably won’t happen.", "I can’t do it by myself. We’re going to have to change the laws in Congress, but I’m confident we can make it happen.", "MR. ZUCKERBERG: All right. So the next one is from a Facebook employee, Leo Abraham. Leo, where are you from?", "Q Hi, hey. I’m from -- originally from San Jose, California. My question is: The 2012 budget plan proposed by Paul Ryan has been praised by many in the media as bold or brave.", "Do you see this as a time that calls for boldness, and do you think that the plan you outlined last week demonstrated sufficient boldness, or is this just a media creation?", "THE PRESIDENT: No, it’s a great question. Look, here is what I’d say. The Republican budget that was put forward I would say is fairly radical.", "I wouldn’t call it particularly courageous. I do think Mr. Ryan is sincere. I think he’s a patriot. I think he wants to solve a real problem, which is our long-term deficit.", "But I think that what he and the other Republicans in the House of Representatives also want to do is change our social compact in a pretty fundamental way.", "Their basic view is that no matter how successful I am, no matter how much I’ve taken from this country -- I wasn’t born wealthy; I was raised by a single mom and my grandparents.", "I went to college on scholarships. There was a time when my mom was trying to get her PhD, where for a short time she had to take food stamps.", "My grandparents relied on Medicare and Social Security to help supplement their income when they got old.", "So their notion is, despite the fact that I’ve benefited from all these investments -- my grandfather benefited from the GI Bill after he fought in World War II -- that somehow I now have no obligation to people who are less fortunate than me and I have no real obligation to future generations to make investments so that they have a better.", "So what his budget proposal does is not only hold income tax flat, he actually wants to further reduce taxes for the wealthy, further reduce taxes for corporations, not pay for those, and in order to make his numbers work, cut 70 percent out of our clean energy budget, cut 25 percent out of our education budget, cut transportation budgets by a third.", "I guess you could call that bold. I would call it shortsighted. (Applause.)", "And then, as I said, there’s a fundamental difference between how the Republicans and I think about Medicare and Medicaid and our health care system.", "Their basic theory is that if we just turn Medicare into a voucher program and turn Medicaid into block grant programs, then now you, a Medicare recipient, will go out and you’ll shop for the best insurance that you’ve got -- that you can find -- and that you’re going to control costs because you’re going to say to the insurance company, this is all I can afford.", "That will control costs, except if you get sick and the policy that you bought doesn’t cover what you’ve got.", "Then either you’re going to mortgage your house or you’re going to go to the emergency room, in which case I, who do have insurance, are going to have to pay for it indirectly because the hospital is going to have uncompensated care.", "So they don’t really want to make the health care system more efficient and cheaper. What they want to do is to push the costs of health care inflation on to you.", "And then you’ll be on your own trying to figure out in the marketplace how to make health care cheaper.", "The problem is, you’re just one person. Now, you work at Facebook, it’s a big enough company; Facebook can probably negotiate with insurance companies and providers to get you a pretty good deal.", "But if you’re a startup company, if you’re an entrepreneur out there in the back of your garage, good luck trying to get insurance on your own.", "You can’t do it. If you’re somebody who’s older and has a preexisting condition, insurance companies won’t take you.", "So what we’ve said is let’s make sure instead of just pushing the costs off on to people who individually are not going to have any negotiating power or ability to change how providers operate, or how hospitals or doctors operate, how insurance companies operate, let’s make sure that we have a system both for Medicare but also for people who currently don’t have health insurance where they can be part of a big pool.", "They can negotiate for changes in how the health care system works so that it’s more efficient; so that it’s more effective; so that you get better care, so that we have fewer infection rates, for example, in hospitals; so there are fewer readmission rates; so that we’re caring for the chronically ill more effectively; so that there are fewer unnecessary tests.", "That’s how you save money. The government will save money, but you’ll also save money.", "So we think that’s a better way of doing it. Now, what they’ll say is, well, you know what, that will never work because it’s government imposed and it’s bureaucracy", "and it’s government takeover and there are death panels. I still don’t entirely understand the whole “death panel” concept.", "But I guess what they’re saying is somehow some remote bureaucrat will be deciding your health care for you.", "All we’re saying is if we’ve got health care experts -- doctors and nurses and consumers -- who are helping to design how Medicare works more intelligently, then we don't have to radically change Medicare.", "So, yes, I think it’s fair to say that their vision is radical. No, I don't think it’s particularly courageous.", "Because the last point I’ll make is this. Nothing is easier than solving a problem on the backs of people who are poor or people who are powerless or don't have lobbyists or don't have clout.", "I don't think that's particularly courageous. (Applause.)", "MR. ZUCKERBERG: All right, the next one is from the web. We’ve got a question from Kwami Simmons (ph) from Orlando, Florida.", "And he asks: “I strongly believe that education is the greatest equalizer. With so many problems plaguing our current system, is it possible to examine a complete overhaul of the system so that it addresses the needs of modern students?”", "And before you jump in, I just want to say as someone who has spent a bunch of time researching education and who cares about this, I think the Race to the Top stuff that you guys have done is one of the most under-appreciated and most important things that your administration has done.", "THE PRESIDENT: I appreciate that. This is an area where actually I think you’ve seen the parties actually come together.", "It used to be that the argument around education always revolved around the left saying we just need more money, and the right saying we should just blow up the system because public schools aren’t doing a good job.", "And what you’re now seeing is people recognizing we need both money and reform. It’s not an either-or proposition; it’s a both-and proposition.", "So what Mark just mentioned, something called Race to the Top, pretty simple concept. Most federal dollars are allocated through a formula.", "If you’ve got a certain number of poor kids or you’ve got a certain number of disabled kids in your school district, there’s a formula, and you get a certain amount of money.", "And every state and every school district gets that money according to the formula.", "What we did was we took about 1 percent of the total spending on education and we said, to get this 1 percent, show us that you’re reforming the system.", "It’s almost -- it’s like a competition model. And so every state, every school district could apply. And you had to show us that you had a good plan to retrain teachers and recruit and do good professional development so we’ve got the best teacher possible.", "You had to have accountability. You had to show us that you were actually making progress in the schools, and that you were measuring through data the improvements that were being made; that you were reaching into the schools that were hardest to reach -- because there are about 2,000 schools around the country that account for the majority of dropouts in our country.", "They're like dropout factories -- so show us a plan to go into those schools and really make a big difference.", "And what’s happened is that over 40 states, in the process of competing for this extra money, ended up initiating probably the most meaningful reforms that we’ve seen in a generation.", "And so it’s made a huge difference. Even those states that didn't end up actually winning the competition still made changes that are improving the potential for good outcomes in the schools.", "So that's the kind of creative approach that you’ve seen some Democrats and some Republicans embrace.", "A couple of things that we know work: The most important thing to a good education is making sure we’ve got a good teacher in front of that classroom.", "And so providing more support for teachers, recruiting the best and brightest into teaching, making sure that they're compensated, but also making sure that they're performing, that's hugely important.", "The other thing is good data so that there’s a constant feedback, not just a bunch of standardized tests that go into a drawer or that people may game in order not to get penalized.", "That's what happened under No Child Left Behind. But instead, real good data that you can present to the teacher while they're still teaching that child and say, you know what, this child is falling behind in math; here are some ways to do it, to improve their performance.", "So we’re starting to see real progress on the ground, and I’m optimistic that we can actually, before the 2012 election, potentially have a federal education law that will embody some of the best information that we have about how to initiate good school reform.", "Now, last point I’ll make on this: Government alone can’t do it. One of the things every time I come to Silicon Valley that I’m inspired by but I’m also frustrated by is how many smart people are here, but also frustrated that I always hear stories about how we can’t find enough engineers, we can’t find enough computer programmers.", "You know what, that means our education system is not working the way it should, and that's got to start early.", "And that's why we’re emphasizing math and science. That's why we’re emphasizing teaching girls math and science.", "(Applause.) That's why we’re emphasizing making sure that black and Hispanic kids are getting math and science.", "We’ve got to do such a better job when it comes to STEM education. AAnd that’s one of the reasons, by the way, that we had our first science fair at the White House in a very long time, just because we want to start making science cool.", "(Applause.) I want people to feel the same way about the next big energy breakthrough or the next big Internet breakthrough, I want people to feel the same way they felt about the moon launch -- that that’s how we’re going to stay competitive for the future.", "And that’s why these investments in education are so important.", "But, as I said, government alone can’t do it. There has got to be a shift in American culture, where once again we buckle down and we say this stuff is important and it’s -- that’s why, Mark, the work you’re doing in Newark, for example, the work that the Gates Foundation are doing in philanthropic investments, in best practices and education -- especially around math and science training -- are going to be so important.", "We’ve got to lift -- we’ve got to lift our game up when it comes to technology and math and science. That’s, hopefully, one of the most important legacies that I can have as President of the United States.", "MR. ZUCKERBERG: All right. So the next one is from another Facebook employee. Here’s James Mitchell. So, James Mitchell, where are you from?", "Q I'm James Mitchell, born in Chicago and raised out here in Cupertino, California. I have yet another question for you about the debt and health care.", "Q So the biggest threat we have fiscally is the rise in health care costs. Unfortunately, a lot of the solutions we hear to Medicare and Medicaid don’t involve actually slowing down the rise in health care costs.", "Instead, they involve shifting costs to beneficiaries and states. So my question is: Can you talk a bit more about what provisions of the Affordable Health Care Act are designed to slow down the rise of health care costs, and what policies you’d like to see enacted in the future to continue to slow down the rise of health care costs?", "THE PRESIDENT: Let me give you a couple of examples, because you’re exactly right in how you describe it.", "I don’t want to just shift the health care costs on to the American people, I want to actually reduce health care costs.", "Let’s take the example of health IT. We’re in Silicon Valley, so we can talk about IT stuff. I’ll try to sound like I know what I’m talking about.", "(Laughter.) The health care system is one of the few aspects of our society where a lot of stuff is still done on paper.", "The last time you guys went to a doctor’s office or maybe to your dentist’s office, how many people still had, like, to fill out a form on a clipboard?", "Right? And the reason for that is because a large chunk of our provider system is not automated. So what ends up happening is you may go to your primary care physician; he does some basic tests, he sees something of concern, he refers you to a specialist.", "You’re getting charged, or your insurance company is getting charged, for both those tests, as opposed to the test that was taken by your primary care physician being emailed to the specialist.", "Or better yet, if it turns out that there may be three or four specialists involved, because it’s a difficult diagnosis -- this is all hypothetical; you look very healthy.", "(Laughter.) But let’s say there were a bunch of specialists. What would be ideal would be if you get all the specialists together with the primary care physician the first time you’re seen so that you’re not paying for multiple visits as well as multiple tests.", "That’s not how it works right now. Now, part of it is technology. So what we did in the Affordable Care Act, building on what we did with the Recovery Act, is try to provide incentives to providers to start getting integrated, automated systems.", "And it’s tough because the individual doctor may say to him or herself, I don’t want to put out the initial capital outlay; that’s expensive even though it may make my system more efficient later on.", "So providing some incentives, some help, for the front end investments for a community hospital or for individual providers so that we can slowly get this system more effective, that’s priority number one.", "We know it can be done, by the way. Surprisingly enough, the health care system that is -- does the best job on this of anybody is actually the Veterans Administration, the VA health care system, because it’s a fully integrated system.", "Everybody is working for the VA, all the doctors, all the hospitals, all the providers, so they’ve been able to achieve huge cost savings just because everybody is on a single system.", "It’s also, though, how we reimburse doctors and how we reimburse hospitals. So right now, what happens is, when you’ve taken those two tests, if you’re old enough to qualify for Medicare, well, each doctor sends their bill to Medicare and Medicare pays both bills.", "And let’s say that you end up getting an operation. They’ll send the bill for that, and Medicare pays that.", "Let’s say they didn’t do a very good job, or you got sick in the hospital, and you are readmitted and you have to be treated again and they have to do the operation all over again.", "Medicare then gets billed for the second operation.", "I mean, imagine if that’s how it worked when you bought a car. So you go, you buy your car. A week later, the car doesn’t work.", "You go back to the dealer and they charged you to fix the bad job that they did in the first place. Well, that’s what Medicare does all the time.", "So we don’t provide incentives for performance. We just provide -- we just pay for the number of qualified items that were procedures that were performed or tests that were performed by the provider.", "So what we want to do is to start changing how folks are reimbursed. Let’s take a hospital. We want to give -- this is sort of like Race to the Top, what Mark was talking about in education.", "We want to be able to say to a hospital, if you do a really good job reducing infection rates in the hospital, which kill tens of thousands of people across America every year and are a huge cause for readmission rates, and we know that hospitals can drastically reduce those reinfection rates just by simple protocols of how employees are washing their hands and how they’re moving from room to room and so forth -- there are hospitals who have done it -- if we can say to a hospital, you’ll get a bonus for that, Medicare will reimburse you for instituting these simple procedures, that saves the whole system money.", "And that's what we’ve tried to do in the Affordable Care Act, is to start institutionalizing these new systems.", "But it takes time because we’ve got a private sector system -- it’s not like the VA -- a bunch of individual doctors, individual hospitals spread out all across the country with private insurers.", "Our hope is, is that over the next five years, we’re able to see significant savings through these mechanisms, and that will save everybody -- not just people who are on Medicare and Medicaid -- it will save everybody money including folks here at Facebook.", "Because I’m sure that you guys provide health insurance and I suspect if you look at your health insurance bills they don't make you happy.", "MR. ZUCKERBERG: So we have time for only one more question.", "MR. ZUCKERBERG: It’s a question from Terry Atwater (ph) from Houston, Texas: “If you had to do anything differently during your first four years, what would it be?”", "THE PRESIDENT: Well, it’s only been two and a half, so I’m sure I’ll make more mistakes in the next year and a half.", "The jury will still be out. (Laughter.) There are all sorts of day-to-day issues where I say to myself, oh, I didn't say that right, or I didn't explain this clearly enough, or maybe if I had sequenced this plan first as opposed to that one, maybe it would have gotten done quicker.", "Health care obviously was a huge battle, and if it hadn’t been for Nancy Pelosi and her leadership in the House and the great work that -- (applause) -- Anna Eshoo and Mike Honda and others did -- we wouldn’t have gotten it done if it hadn’t been for great work in Congress.", "But I do think that it was so complicated that at a certain point people just started saying, oh, this is typical Washington bickering.", "And I’ve asked myself sometimes is there a way that we could have gotten it done more quickly and in a way that the American people wouldn’t have been so frustrated by it?", "I’m not sure I could have because there’s a reason why it hadn’t gotten done in a hundred years. It is a -- it’s hard to fix a system as big as health care and as complicated as our health care system.", "I can tell you that -- I think the best way to answer the question is what do I feel I still have to get done, where I still feel a huge sense of urgency.", "I’ve talked about a couple of things. Getting our deficits and debt under control in a balanced way I feel needs to happen while I’m President.", "Immigration -- something I mentioned -- we have not gotten done. It’s something I care deeply about. It’s the right thing for the country.", "Energy -- we haven’t talked a lot about energy today, but first of all, $4-a-gallon gas really hurts a lot of people around this country.", "It’s not because they're wasteful, but if you’re driving 50 miles to work and that's the only job you can find, and you can’t afford some hybrid so you’re stuck with the old beater that you’re driving around that gets eight miles a gallon, these gas prices are killing you right now.", "And so this is the reason why I’ve said that it is so important for us to invest in new approaches to energy.", "We’ve got to have a long-term plan. It means investing in things like solar and wind, investing in biofuels, investing in clean car technology.", "It means converting the federal fleet 100 percent to fuel-efficient vehicles, because we’re a huge market maker.", "Obviously it turns out that I’ve got a lot of cars as President. (Laughter.)", "And if we’re out there purchasing electric cars and hybrids, that can help boost demand and drive down prices.", "Continuing to increase fuel-efficiency standards on cars; increasing oil production but in an intelligent way.", "I mean, those are all hugely important. And by the way, we can pay for it.", "Let me say this. We lose -- the Treasury loses $4 billion a year on subsidies to oil companies. Now, think about this.", "The top five oil companies have made somewhere between $75 billion and $125 billion every year for the last five years.", "Nobody is doing better than Exxon. Nobody is doing better than Shell or these other companies. They are doing great.", "They are making money hand over fist. Well, maybe Facebook is doing a little better. (Laughter.) But you get the idea.", "They’re doing really well. They don’t need special tax breaks that cost us $4 billion. So what we’ve said is, why can’t we eliminate the tax breaks for the oil companies who are doing great, and invest that in new energy sources that can help us save the planet?", "So when it comes to energy, when it comes to immigration, when it comes to getting our deficit under control in a balanced and smart way, when it comes to improving our math and science education, when it comes to reinvesting in our infrastructure, we’ve just got a lot more work to do.", "And I guess my closing comment, Mark, would just be I hope that everybody here -- that you don’t get frustrated and cynical about our democracy.", "I mean it is frustrating. Lord knows it’s frustrating. (Laughter.) And I know that some of you who might have been involved in the campaign or been energized back in 2008, you’re frustrated that, gosh, it didn’t get done fast enough and it seems like everybody is bickering all the time.", "Just remember that we’ve been through tougher times before. We’ve always come out ascendant, we’ve always come out on top, because we’ve still got the best universities in the world, we’ve still got the most productive workers in the world, this is still the most dynamic, entrepreneurial culture in the world.", "If we come together, we can solve all these problems. But I can’t do it by myself. The only way it happens is if all of you still get involved, still get engaged.", "It hasn’t been that long since Election Day, and we’ve gone through some very, very tough times and we’ve still gotten a lot done.", "We’ve still been able to get this economy recovering. We’ve still been able to get health care passed.", "We’ve still been able to invest in clean energy. We’ve still been able to make sure that we overturn “don’t ask, don’t tell.”", "We still made sure that we got two women on the Supreme Court. We’ve made progress. (Applause.)", "So rather than be discouraged, I hope everybody is willing to double down and work even harder. Regardless of your political affiliation, you’ve got to be involved, especially the young people here, your generation.", "If you don’t give us a shove, if you don’t give the system a push, it’s just not going to change. And you’re going to be the ones who end up suffering the consequences.", "But if you are behind it, if you put the same energy and imagination that you put into Facebook into the political process, I guarantee you there’s nothing we can’t solve.", "MR. ZUCKERBERG: So I just want to thank you again. It’s such an honor to have you here.", "MR. ZUCKERBERG: And as a small token of our appreciation, in case for some reason you want to dress like me --", "THE PRESIDENT: This is a high-fashion statement right here.

Doing so means, for example, that you won't get an ad on Facebook for a pair of shoes you just looked at on a shopping website, though you'll still get generic ads.", "But that doesn't stop the data collection.

(xii) the markets in which we participate involve numerous competitors and are highly competitive, and if we do not compete effectively, our operating results could be harmed; (xiii) if our existing clients terminate their subscriptions or reduce their subscriptions and related usage, our revenues and gross margins will be harmed and we will be required to spend more money to grow our client base; (xiv) we sell our solution to larger organizations that require longer sales and implementation cycles and often demand more configuration and integration services or customized features and functions that we may not offer, any of which could delay or prevent these sales and harm our growth rates, business and operating results; (xv) because a significant percentage of our revenue is derived from existing clients, downturns or upturns in new sales will not be immediately reflected in our operating results and may be difficult to discern;

(xvii) we have a history of losses and we may be unable to achieve or sustain profitability; (xviii) the contact center software solutions market is subject to rapid technological change, and we must develop and sell incremental and new products in order to maintain and grow our business;

Thanks to the generous support of sovereign, private sector, and philanthropic donors, the AMC has met its urgent 2020 fundraising target of US$ 2 billion, but at least US$ 4.6 billion more is needed in 2021 to procure doses of successful candidates as they come through the portfolio.", "The last two weeks have seen a number of pledges made to Gavi for the COVAX AMC, bringing the overall amount raised to US$ 2.4 billion:", "- Norway has signed a new commitment of NOK 1 billion to the International Finance Facility for Immunisation (IFFIm), to be paid from 2021 to 2030.", "This funding will support the Gavi COVAX AMC and comes on top of earlier commitments of NOK 164.1 million in direct funding and $6.25 million in funding transferred from the PCV AMC to support the Gavi COVAX AMC.", "- Canada pledged CAD 75 million in funding to support the delivery of COVID-19 vaccines in lower income economies as part of the Gavi COVAX AMC.", "This includes a CAD 5 million investment in the development of a mechanism to equitably reallocate vaccine doses through the COVAX Facility, either by donation or exchange.", "- Kuwait has confirmed a pledge of US$ 10 million to the Gavi COVAX AMC.", "- Denmark has announced, subject to parliamentary approval, a commitment of DKK 50 million to Gavi COVAX AMC.", "- New Zealand has pledged NZ$ 10 million to the Gavi COVAX AMC, in addition to NZ$ 7 million pledged earlier this year for the AMC.", "- Netherlands has signed and paid a commitment of EUR 5 million to the Gavi COVAX AMC", "- Singapore has pledged US$ 5 million to the Gavi COVAX AMC", "- The King Salman Humanitarian Aid and Relief Center (KSrelief) / Gamers Without Borders have confirmed a pledge of US$ 1.3 million to the Gavi COVAX AMC", "- Estonia has signed a commitment of EUR 70,000 to the Gavi COVAX AMC", "- In addition to these pledges, Team Europe confirmed financial support of EUR 500 million, through EUR 400 million European Investment Bank loan and EUR100 million grant to Gavi, in support of equitable access through COVAX.", "The goal of COVAX is to deliver two billion doses of safe, effective vaccines that have passed regulatory approval and/or WHO prequalification by the end of 2021.", "These vaccines will be offered equally to all participating countries, proportional to their populations, initially prioritising healthcare workers then expanding to cover vulnerable groups, such as the elderly and those with pre-existing conditions.", "Further doses will then be made available based on country need, vulnerability and COVID-19 threat. The COVAX Facility will also maintain a buffer of doses for emergency and humanitarian use.", "Karina Gould, Minister of International Development, Government of Canada said: “We know that as long as one country is at risk, we are all at risk.", "The COVAX Facility is the key to ending this pandemic and will only work if we all come together. Now is the time to make our commitment to equitable access a reality, so that everyone, everywhere has access to a life-saving vaccine.”", "Dr Kwaku Agyeman Manu, Minister of Health for Ghana said: The nearly 2 billion COVID-19 vaccine doses announced today by COVAX is a welcome first step, but our journey is not yet over.", "As we’ve learned with routine immunisation vaccines don’t save lives, vaccination does. This means we need the health infrastructure in place - from supply chain and logistics to well- trained health workers - to ensure the effective and streamlined distribution of vaccines.", "For this we call on governments, manufacturers and the private sector to make urgent and necessary investments in COVAX so that no one is left behind; because ultimately no one is safe until everyone is safe.", "Dag-Inge Ulstein, Norway’s Minister of International Development and Co-chair of the ACT-A Facilitation Council, said: “The good news is that many countries, foundations and some private companies have already provided support to this important collective effort.", "The bad news is that more is needed.

It’s time to stop questioning it and give it the support it needs to bring the pandemic to an end as swiftly as possible.”", "Jane Halton, co-chair of the COVAX Coordination Meeting and Chair of CEPI said: “Science will give us the tools to fight this pandemic, but equitable access will allow us to beat it.", "Today marks a significant moment towards our goal of fair and equitable access to COVID-19 vaccines for those most at risk around the world.", "We now have a clear pathway to our goal of delivering 2 billion doses of vaccine in 2021 - enabled by COVAX R&D investments and deals with manufacturers - which can bring an end to the acute phase of the pandemic globally.", "In addition, governments can now demonstrate their continued commitment to this goal by contributing doses to COVAX of vaccines secured through bilateral deals.", "Equitable access to vaccines is in all of our interests, and we’re now a significant step closer to making this a reality.”", "Mesfin Teklu Tessema, civil society representative of the COVAX Coordination Meeting and Senior Director, Head of Health Unit, International Rescue Committee said: \"The COVAX Facility is our best hope to ending this pandemic as quickly as possible with equity as its grounding force.", "This announcement today is an important milestone and proof that doses are forthcoming to those most in need everywhere.\"", "Adar Poonawalla, CEO of the Serum Institute of India (SII) said: \"We are delighted to announce that we have signed for a 100mn doses of Novavax and another 100mn doses of AstraZeneca-Oxford vaccines with COVAX, with an option of extending it by 900mn doses.", "The advance purchase commitments under COVAX initiative is encouraging as it will further bolster our fight and ensure equitable access at the most affordable price from Serum Institute of India.”", "Pascal Soriot, Chief Executive Officer, AstraZeneca, said: “Today’s Agreement is a significant milestone for global access to the AZD1222 vaccine.", "Our collaboration with COVAX is testament to AstraZeneca’s commitment to broad, equitable access at no profit during the pandemic period.", "We now look forward to progressing our work with COVAX partners to ensure that as many people as possible around the world can access a safe, effective vaccine – wherever they live.”", "Paul Stoffels, M.D., Vice Chairman of the Executive Committee and Chief Scientific Officer, Johnson & Johnson said: “Since we initiated development of our COVID-19 vaccine candidate, Johnson & Johnson has remained committed to ensuring access to vaccines on a not-for-profit basis for emergency pandemic use.", "Equitable global access, inclusive of lower income countries, is critical to helping end the COVID-19 pandemic.”", "Thomas B. Cueni, Director General, International Federation of Pharmaceutical Manufacturers (IFPMA) said: The reason why we can mark today as a milestone for COVAX securing 2 billion doses of promising vaccines is because the vaccine makers have pulled out all the stops and have delivered beyond all expectations.", "So let’s indeed mark this important milestone in ensuring fair and equitable access to vaccines which we have committed to from the outset of the pandemic.", "But let us also remember, that we would not be where we are if science and the innovation ecosystem that allows the biopharmaceutical to develop and manufacture life saving treatments had not risen to the challenge, so that there are different types of vaccines that will be manufactured in historic quantities.", "Looking to 2021, it is essential that all COVAX partners and governments focus on getting things done and secure the funds need.", "The full list of deals that have so far been secured by COVAX on behalf of the Facility is as follows:", "- 170 million doses of the AstraZeneca/Oxford candidate, via an advance purchase agreement between Gavi and AstraZeneca, and enabled by a partnership agreement with CEPI to fund scale-out of manufacturing", "- 200 million doses (and options for up to 900 million more) of the AstraZeneca/Oxford or Novavax candidates, via an agreement between Gavi, the Serum Institute of India, and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation", "- 500 million doses of the Janssen candidate, via a memorandum of understanding with Johnson & Johnson", "- 200 million doses of the Sanofi/GSK vaccine candidate, via a statement of intent between Gavi, Sanofi and GSK", "- First right of refusal for a potential combined total of over 1 billion doses in 2021 (based on current estimates from the manufacturing processes under development) of promising vaccine candidates, via R&D partnership agreements with CEPI -

Trillions of dollars spent on ecommerce.", "If you’re looking for the latest digital insights and social media stats, you’ll find them all here.", "Start by making sense of the essential headlines and trends in this video presentation, and then read on below that for the full report, and our complete analysis of this year’s top findings.", "Our new Digital 2021 reports series – published in partnership between We Are Social and Hootsuite – shows that connected tech became an even more essential part of people’s lives over the past year, with social media, ecommerce, streaming content, and video games all seeing significant growth in the past 12 months.", "COVID-19 also introduced a new set of challenges and opportunities though, so digital in 2021 will be anything but ‘business as usual’.", "Some of the key themes to look for in this year’s reports include:", "Changes in how people search for information and brands;", "Why mobile is essential, but not the only answer; and", "Why we need to change the metrics that guide our social media ‘mix’.", "Just before we get stuck into the numbers, I’d like to say a very big thank you to all of the data partners and providers who’ve made this year’s reports possible, especially:", "Before we begin: important notes on changes to our methodology", "To ensure we can report the most accurate data, we’ve made important changes to the ways we calculate and talk about some of our numbers.", "We’ve explained these changes in the footnotes of each relevant chart within the report, but I’d like to highlight two of those changes here:", "Social media users: the figures we publish for social media users may not represent unique individuals.", "This is because some social media accounts may represent animals, businesses, places, and various other kinds of ‘non-human’ entities, while some people may also manage more than one social media account on the same platform.", "As a result, we’ve changed the way we talk about social media user numbers to make it clear that the figures may not represent “people.”", "We’ve also changed the source we use for social media users in China, which has resulted in some changes to historical figures, including global totals.", "Internet user numbers: with a handful of exceptions where no other data is available, we’ve stopped using data sourced from social media platforms to inform our internet user numbers.", "This is to ensure that those duplicate and ‘non-human’ social media accounts don’t artificially inflate internet adoption figures.", "Because of this change, the internet user numbers that you’ll see in this year’s report are not comparable to the numbers we published in previous years, and for many countries, this year’s internet users number will appear lower than the figures we published last year.", "However, in most cases, this does not mean that internet users have actually dropped. We’ve been able to re-calculate internet user figures for last year based on the same sources we’ve used this year, so the annual and quarterly growth figures we’ve included in this year’s reports accurately reflect how much internet user numbers have changed over time.", "Please refer to these published growth figures whenever you want to compare changes over time.", "You’ll find our complete Digital 2021 Global Overview Report in the SlideShare embed below (click here if that’s not working for you), but read on below for my detailed analysis of this year’s top headlines and trends.", "Here are the headline stats and trends for the global ‘State of Digital’ in January 2021:", "Population: the world’s population stood at 7.83 billion at the start of 2021. The United Nations reports that this figure is currently growing by 1 percent per year, which means that the global total has increased by more than 80 million people since the start of 2020.", "Mobile: 5.22 billion people use a mobile phone today, equating to 66.6 percent of the world’s total population.", "Unique mobile users have grown by 1.8 percent (93 million) since January 2020, while the total number of mobile connections has increased by 72 million (0.9 percent) to reach a total of 8.02 billion at the start of 2021.", "Internet: 4.66 billion people around the world use the internet in January 2021, up by 316 million (7.3 percent) since this time last year.", "Global internet penetration now stands at 59.5 percent.", "Social media: there are now 4.20 billion social media users around the world. This figure has grown by 490 million over the past 12 months, delivering year-on-year growth of more than 13 percent.", "The number of social media users is now equivalent to more than 53 percent of the world’s total population.", "Despite these impressive figures, it’s worth noting that the ongoing coronavirus pandemic has significantly impacted research into internet use around the world, so many countries have been unable to provide updates to internet user numbers in the past 12 months.", "As a result, internet user numbers have likely grown more than the reported 7 percent, and we may see ‘corrections’ to these figures once everyday life (and research) can return to normal.", "But beyond tasty trivia, what does all this data tell us about what people are actually doing online?", "[Side note: just like last year, my review of this year’s key trends is a bit of a monster – more than 9,000 words – so you might want to grab yourself a coffee and get comfortable first.]", "As we’ve been tracking in our ongoing series of quarterly Statshot reports, social media growth has accelerated significantly since the outbreak of COVID-19.", "Social media user numbers increased by more than 13 percent over the past year, with nearly half a billion new users taking the global user total to almost 4.2 billion by the start of 2021.", "On average, more than 1.3 million new users joined social media every day during 2020, equating to roughly 15½ new users every single second.", "Our analysis shows that the number of global social media users has more than doubled since January 2016, while more than 1 billion new users have been added to the global total in the past 3 years alone.", "Despite significant changes in digital behaviours due to COVID-19, people say that they’re spending roughly the same amount of time each day on social media today as they did this time last year.", "However, GWI data does show that the daily average has increased by more than half an hour over the past 5 years.", "The typical user now spends 2 hours and 25 minutes on social media each day, equating to roughly one full waking day of their life each week.", "Added together, the world’s social media users will spend a total of 3.7 trillion hours on social media in 2021 – equivalent to more than 420 million years of combined human existence.", "As we’ve seen in previous years though, there are significant differences between countries.", "Filipinos are still the world’s biggest consumers of social media, spending an average of 4 hours and 15 minutes per day using social platforms – a full half an hour more than second-placed Colombians.", "At the other end of the scale, users in Japan say they spend less than an hour a day on social media, although this year’s figure of 51 minutes is still 13 percent higher than Japanese users reported spending on social channels this time last year.", "The latest data from GSMA Intelligence shows that two-thirds of the world’s total population uses a mobile phone today.", "This figure has remained steady for the past few years, but that’s perhaps not surprising when we consider that the world’s 5.2 billion mobile users equate to more than 85 percent of all the people on Earth aged 13 and above.", "But mobile’s dominance isn’t just about user numbers; it’s also about time spent, and how that compares to other devices.", "Data from App Annie shows that Android users around the world now spend more than 4 hours each day using their phones.", "In total, that means Android users spent more than 3.5 trillion cumulative hours using their phones over the past 12 months.", "And perhaps more tellingly, App Annie’s flagship State of Mobile 2021 report also reveals that mobiles now account for a greater amount of people’s time than live TV.", "This is the case even in the United States, where the average American now spends more than 4 hours per day using their mobile phone, compared to roughly 3¾ hours each day watching live TV.", "GWI reports similar findings, with the company’s latest research finding that a typical global internet user now spends 3 hours and 39 minutes each day using the internet on their mobile phone.", "This compares to a total of 3 hours and 24 minutes per day watching television, but it’s worth noting that people are increasingly watching “TV” content via streaming apps on their mobile devices too.", "However, mobile devices only account for about half of our daily internet time.", "In total, the average internet user now spends almost 7 hours per day using the internet across all devices, equating to more than 48 hours per week online – that’s a full two days out of a seven-day week.", "Assuming that the average person sleeps for between 7 and 8 hours per day, this means that we now spend roughly 42 percent of our waking lives online, and that we spend almost as much time using the internet as we do sleeping.", "The figures also show that people are spending more time online each day than they did in previous years.", "The latest findings from GWI show that the typical internet user spent 16 minutes longer online each day in Q3 2020 than they did in Q3 2019, representing a year-on-year increase of 4 percent.", "If these rates continue throughout 2021, the world’s internet users will spend almost 12 trillion hours online this year, which translates to more than 1.3 billion years of combined human time.", "However, as we saw in last year’s report, there’s significant variation in the amount of time that people in different countries spend online.", "Filipinos report spending the greatest amount of time online, at an average of almost 11 hours per day.", "Brazilians, Colombians, and South Africans also say they spend an average of more than 10 hours per day online.", "At the other end of the scale, the Japanese report spending the least amount of time online, at less than 4½ hours per day.", "Interestingly, the figure for China also falls at the lower end of the spectrum, at just 5 hours and 22 minutes per day – 1½ hours less than the global average of 6 hours and 54 minutes.", "Mobile phones now account for roughly 53 percent of the time the world spends online, but the data clearly shows that other devices still play important roles in our connected lives.", "9 in 10 internet users say they go online via a smartphone, but two-thirds also say that they use a laptop or desktop computer to access the internet.", "However, once again, things vary considerably by country.", "Mobiles are now the most widely used internet device in all countries, but the gap between mobiles and computers is often quite small, especially in Western Europe.", "For example, 46 percent of Belgium’s internet users say that computers are their primary internet devices, compared to 49 percent for phones, and 5 percent for tablets.", "Japan also sees relatively high computer use, with more than 4 in 10 internet users saying they prefer to go online via a laptop or desktop device.", "The stage of a country’s economic development plays a role in shaping these ratios, but the median age of the population is also a critical driver.", "As GWI reports, Baby Boomers are more likely to go online via computers and tablets than via phones, with mobile devices accounting for less than 50 percent of total internet time amongst users aged 45 and above.", "Meanwhile, the latest data from StatCounter shows that computers still account for a meaningful share of the world’s web activity.", "More than 40 percent of web pages served in December 2020 were requested by web browsers running on laptop and desktop devices, although the overall share of these devices is down slightly compared to December 2019.", "The relative importance of different devices also varies considerably between countries.", "StatCounter’s data shows that mobile phones account for more than 8 in 10 pages served to web browsers in Nigeria, but that figure drops to barely a quarter of web pages served to browsers in Russia.", "It’s worth highlighting that web browsing only accounts for a small share of overall mobile time, with people spending far more time using mobile apps.", "The latest data from App Annie reveals that native apps account for 92 percent of the time that the world’s Android users spend on their phones, while just 8 percent of that time is spent using mobile web browsers.", "One simple takeaway is that mobile is clearly an essential part of the mix, but we certainly can’t ignore other devices – especially in Western markets, or when we’re hoping to engage older audiences.", "Finding information is the main reason why people go online, with almost two-thirds of the world’s internet users saying this is one of their top motivations.", "However, the latest research from GWI shows that the world’s search behaviours are evolving, and their changing behaviour has important consequences for anyone hoping to engage a digital audience.", "Conventional search engines are still an essential part of the mix of course, with a massive 98 percent of respondents saying that they use a search engine every month.", "However, more than 7 in 10 respondents also say that they now use at least one tool other than text-based search engines to find information online each month.", "Voice interfaces are the most popular alternative to text-based search engines, with 45 percent of global internet users saying that they used voice search or voice commands in the past 30 days.", "It’s important to stress that digital assistants on mobile phones, such as Siri and Google Assistant, account for the majority of this voice activity.", "Smart speakers represent an exciting opportunity, but barely 1 in 12 internet users around the world owns one of these devices today, so their potential is still limited outside of North America and Europe.", "Almost a third of the world’s internet users also use image recognition tools on their mobiles each month, with tools such as Pinterest Lens and Google Lens seeing particularly strong adoption across Latin America and Southeast Asia.", "Young women are the most likely to use an image as their search query, with GWI’s research showing that 4 in 10 female internet users aged 16 to 64 have used one of these tools in the past month.", "These tools represent a particularly interesting opportunity for ecommerce brands, especially those in highly aesthetic categories like fashion, beauty, and home furnishing – and even consumer electronics.", "However, it’s easy to see how image recognition technology could also augment other internet-powered tools.", "For example, a curious diner might access a restaurant’s reviews by snapping a picture of the storefront while they’re standing outside, and using that photo as a search query.", "Perhaps the most interesting trend in evolving search behaviours is the rise of social search.", "Roughly 45 percent of global internet users say that they turn to social networks at least once per month when looking for information about products or services that they’re thinking of buying.", "However, that figure is considerably higher amongst younger age groups.", "Indeed, Gen Z internet users are now more likely to start their brand research on social networks than they are to turn to a search engine, and trends suggest that this will soon be the case for younger Millennials too.", "Digging a bit deeper into online search activities, this year’s reports reveal that people are more likely to research “how to do things” on the internet than they are to look for information about specific brands, products, or services.", "This finding has particular salience for marketers, because it offers valuable insights into the best ways to engage an audience.", "For example, rather than merely telling people that your brand is the ideal solution for a particular problem, a ‘how-to’ video may be a more effective way of capturing their attention.", "Teaching people how to get the best out of your products and services is a great way to add mutual value, improve satisfaction, and potentially boost contextual relevance and recall.", "People are actively asking for this kind of content, too.", "Research from GWI that we covered back in our Digital 2020 April Global Statshot Report found that people were actively seeking out more ‘how-to’ videos and tutorial content during COVID-19 lockdowns.", "And while these findings may have been asked in the specific context of coping with the impact of coronavirus movement restrictions, the ongoing ‘motivations’ data that you’ll find on slide 48 of our Digital 2021 Global Overview Report confirm the enduring appeal of this kind of content.", "Another interesting trend we’ve spotted in this year’s search data provides evidence of the rise of content collaboration, as well as third-party mashups and remixes.", "For context, this trend has been particularly evident in the recent ‘Wellerman’ meme, where people across the world have joined forces for duets of popular sea shanties.", "Already hugely popular on TikTok, these videos have found their way across to YouTube too, often in the form of curated collections or remixes of content that was originally published to TikTok.", "However, data from Google Trends suggests that this kind of content ‘porting’ isn’t an entirely new phenomenon.", "If we were to consider ‘Tik Tok’ and ‘TikTok’ (one query with a space, one without) as being essentially the same search, TikTok would have been the third most popular search term on YouTube across the whole of 2020.", "This latest ranking of YouTube queries also highlights the importance of music to the world’s second largest social platform.", "In 2020, 13 of the 20 most popular search terms on YouTube related specifically to music, with 8 of those including some version of the word “song” (including equivalents in non-English languages).", "Internet users’ enthusiasm for music isn’t restricted to YouTube either.", "Google Trends’ ranking of the 20 most common search queries on Google throughout 2020 also features ‘MP3’ in fifteenth place, highlighting the enduring appeal of music downloads despite the rising popularity of music streaming.", "Music streaming is a clear winner too though, with App Annie’s State of Mobile 2021 report revealing that Spotify was the ninth most-used mobile app around the world in 2020.", "And while many musicians may have a different perspective, it’s clear that there’s money to be made in online music too, with Sirius XM’s Pandora ranking 10th in App Annie’s list of the top 10 mobile apps by consumer spend in 2020.", "New data from Ookla shows that internet connection speeds accelerated rapidly over the past year, with average mobile speeds increasing by almost 50 percent compared to this time last year.", "Around the world, the average mobile data connection now offers download speeds of more than 47 megabits per second, which is more than 15 megabits per second faster than the average we reported in our Digital 2020 report.", "The year-on-year pace of change for mobile connections accelerated by roughly 70 percent compared to last year’s figures, indicating that 5G is already delivering tangible benefits for the world’s mobile internet users.", "GSMA Intelligence reports that more than 4 in 5 mobile users around the world now have a connection which is capable of delivering ‘broadband’ data speeds, although not all of these connections will include a data subscription.", "The number of connections identified as “3G or above” grew by roughly 8 percent over the past year, although – once again – the figures vary considerably by geography.", "Perhaps surprisingly, North Korea is one of just 4 countries where all mobile connections are 3G or above.", "At the other end of the scale, there are now just 6 countries where fewer than 20 percent of mobile connections are capable of delivering broadband data speeds.", "There’s a big difference between 3G and 5G though, and the countries that have already activated 5G networks are already seeing significant benefits in terms of mobile data speeds.", "For example, 5G is now readily available on some mobile networks in Qatar, China, and Kuwait, and all 3 of these countries have seen average mobile internet connection speeds more than double over the past 12 months.", "The increased bandwidth available on 5G networks is also starting to make a tangible difference in the continued growth in global mobile data consumption.", "Ericsson reports that the world now consumes roughly 55 billion gigabytes of mobile data each month, with each smartphone device consuming an average of 9.4GB of data per month.", "The company reports that 5G currently accounts for around 4 percent of total mobile data traffic, but forecasts that this will jump to more than 10 percent this year, and more than half of all mobile traffic by 2026.", "These figures all point to the rapidly growing influence of 5G networks on the world’s mobile landscape.", "For a start, faster connections mean that people should be able to enjoy richer content experiences while on the go.", "The average mobile connection is now fast enough to enable users to stream 4K video without any disruption, although given the size of most mobile phone screens, this may not deliver substantial benefits to the average mobile viewer compared to streaming in 1080p.", "However, 5G should bring more tangible benefits to mobile gamers, because 5G is designed to deliver significantly reduced latency.", "This metric is particularly relevant to ‘shooter’ games – the world’s most popular video game format – because connection latency determines how quickly people can see and react to on-screen action.", "Ookla’s latest data shows that average latency across the world’s mobile connections has decreased from 41ms to 36ms over the past year, although the latest mobile figure is still 70 percent slower than the average fixed internet connection.", "However, 5G connections will enable video game companies to offer more compelling mobile-oriented gaming titles in genres where latency is an important consideration, which may significantly increase the appeal of these games across geographies that currently struggle with slower connections.", "This is particularly pertinent in the developing world, where fixed internet infrastructure is often unavailable, and where it does exist, mobile connection speeds are often faster anyway.", "But this is also true in some of the world’s highly developed economies.", "For example, average mobile connection speeds in Australia, the UAE, and Saudi Arabia all outpace the average speed of each country’s fixed internet connections.", "The greater bandwidth offered by 5G should also improve options for people who want to broadcast their own livestreams.", "This has particular relevance to mobile esports and mobile game live-streaming, which depend on fast, stable connections for the best experience.", "Beyond gaming, improved mobile upload speeds will also enable a greater number of people to get involved in live commerce, empowering a new wave of mobile entrepreneurs to sell their wares in real-time via live-stream promotions.", "So, if you’re wondering how 5G might impact your marketing, my tip would be to think beyond current marketing activities, and ask yourself whether now might be a good time to start exploring mobile gaming or live-stream commerce opportunities for your brand.", "One of the most interesting takeaways from the rankings of the world’s top websites in this year’s reports is that a large amount of social media activity still takes place within mobile browsers.", "For example, Semrush reports that Facebook still attracts 1.8 billion unique visitors to its website each month, which equates to roughly two-thirds of its monthly active user base.", "Facebook’s own data suggest that most of these users will be using the company’s native mobile apps more frequently than they visit the web interface, but it’s still interesting to see that the website continues to play an important role.", "However, the figures for some other social platforms are perhaps more surprising.", "For example, WhatsApp and Instagram also attract huge volumes of traffic to their web presences, despite being clearly positioned as ‘app-first’ experiences.", "Semrush also reports that Instagram’s website saw more than 830 million unique visitors in December, while WhatsApp.com attracted 276 million uniques.", "Even TikTok – with its considerable Gen Z skew – attracted almost 200 million visits to its website in December 2020.", "Data from SimilarWeb echoes these findings, with the company reporting even higher unique visitor numbers than Semrush for some of these platforms.", "One hypothesis is that this web traffic is the result of ‘off-platform’ sharing, such as when someone sends a link to an Instagram post via a messenger app like Telegram.", "Meanwhile, when it comes to services like WhatsApp, we might conclude that considerable numbers of people are chatting via the platform’s web interface.", "These findings may not have immediate implications for brands’ advertising activities, but they do offer interesting insights into how the world uses the internet, and in particular, how people’s journeys across different digital platforms take shape.", "A more strategic approach to social media marketing", "In-depth analysis of data collected by GWI shows that at least 98 percent of the users of any given social media platform use at least one other social platform.", "The audiences of individual social platforms are also subject to significant overlaps, with 85 percent of TikTok users aged 16 to 64 saying they use Facebook, and almost 95 percent of Instagram users saying they also use YouTube.", "The extent of these audience overlaps has particular relevance to marketers, who often spend significant amounts of time debating which platforms to use for their activities.", "The key takeaway here is that brands do not need to be active on every single platform, and in fact the data show that a presence on just one or two of the larger platforms offers the potential to reach almost all of the world’s social media users.", "For context, at least 6 platforms now have more than 1 billion monthly active users, while at least 17 have more than 300 million.", "However, this doesn’t mean that marketers should focus solely on these larger platforms.", "Indeed, the data support the argument for a more strategic, portfolio approach to social media.", "Rather than focusing all of their attention on reach, marketers can now explore other factors, such as the specific creative opportunities offered by each platform’s content formats, or the different engagement opportunities available on more ‘niche’ platforms.", "And the good news is that – if we look beyond reach – we have plenty of options to choose from, even when it comes to social media.", "GWI’s data shows that the typical global user now has a presence on more than 8 different social channels, although the data also indicate that people use these channels with varying frequency and different levels of engagement.", "However, it’s very unlikely that people use each of their 8.4 different platforms for exactly the same purpose.", "GWI’s data clearly show that people use social platforms for a variety of different reasons, and these underlying motivations offer a far better basis for planning than reach figures alone.", "So, next time you’re planning a campaign, look beyond platform user numbers, and ask yourself:", "Which platform(s) will be most relevant to their motivations?", "How can I use these channels to achieve my desired outcomes?", "As we’ll see in the next sections though, people’s motivations and platform choices also vary meaningfully by location and by demographic, so be sure to dig into our latest local country reports for richer insights into your specific audience’s behaviours.", "The internet may seem like a truly global environment, but the data in this year’s reports clearly show that people’s behaviours and preferences vary considerably between geographies.", "Furthermore, while many platforms are popular amongst users all over the world, the ways in which people use those platforms often differ meaningfully between geographies.", "For these reasons, marketers need to invest time to understand the nuances of their specific audiences.", "In particular, global marketers need to go beyond the headlines reported in Western media, because trends in these countries are only representative of a small fraction of global digital audiences.", "For context, the United States accounts for fewer than 1 in 15 (6.4 percent) of the world’s internet users.", "Users across the whole of the EU and the UK account for less than 10 percent of the global total, while internet users across all of the world’s 60-plus ‘highly developed’ economies account for less than one-third of the world’s total connected population.", "And just in case you’re thinking that developed economies account for the majority of the world’s spending, Statista reports that China – which doesn’t feature in that list of ‘developed’ economies – now accounts for almost half (46 percent) of the world’s total consumer ecommerce spending.", "The first step is to pay closer attention to what’s happening at a local level.", "You’ll find all of our latest reports for every single country in the world – completely for free – in the DataReportal library.", "I’d also recommend going beyond headlines to identify the corresponding audience for each “juicy stat”.", "Don’t assume that reports of a meteoric rise in the users of a new social platform have any bearing on your audience in your country.", "It’s always better to invest time to find out which channels your audience prefers, and what they use each platform for.", "In many cases, you may find that digital platforms that haven’t made the news for years in your home country are still the dominant choice in another market.", "A good example of this is Yahoo!, which remains one of the top destinations for audiences in Japan.", "However, it’s also important to look beyond your bubble – especially if you want to identify emerging trends that may shape your audience’s future behaviour.", "Various trends suggest that the ‘next big trend’ in digital won’t emerge from a Western market.", "For example, as we saw above, the connected behaviours of people across Asia and Latin America are already reshaping online search.", "Similarly, the popularity of live-streaming has revolutionised online shopping in China, where the ‘live commerce’ market is now worth around US$60 billion a year.", "The live-stream shopping format has become so popular in China that just one influencer – Viya – sold more than US$4.5 billion through her Taobao live-stream channel last year.", "For context, reports suggest that this equates to roughly the same amount that supermarket chain Carrefour sold across all its stores in China in the same period.", "However, data shows that the popularity of live commerce isn’t just a Chinese phenomenon, with the format also picking up momentum across Southeast Asia and India.", "What’s more, these three regions – China, Southern Asia, and Southeastern Asia – account for more than half of today’s global internet user base, so this is an opportunity that marketers around the world will want to tap into, even if live-stream shopping hasn’t taken off in their home market yet.", "Developing nations are also leading the way when it comes to innovations in digital finance.", "For example, the latest data from GWI shows that internet users across Africa, Latin America, and Southeast Asia are far more likely to own cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, compared to their peers in Europe and North America.", "However, the impact of these trends isn’t restricted to the developing world; they also have real significance for marketers in the West.", "With many developed nations already seeing internet adoption rates in excess of 90 percent, big internet companies from the US and China know that they need to look to emerging markets to secure the next wave of growth.", "To ensure the best possible chances of success, these companies also know that they’ll need to tailor their products and services to the needs, behaviours, and preferences of these new audiences.", "However, economies of scale are a critical consideration for big internet companies, which means that they’re unlikely to develop significantly different products for each region or local market.", "As a result, we can expect to see the influence of trends and developments in developing markets appear in Western platforms too, potentially resulting in changes in behaviour across developed economies as well.", "We’ve included a wealth of new charts in this year’s reports that offer insights into connected activities by age and gender.", "One of the most revealing of these charts shows how adoption of ecommerce varies by demographic.", "And the clear takeaway from this GWI data is that internet users in the Baby Boomer generation are only marginally less likely to use ecommerce than Gen Z and Millennial internet users.", "Moreover, female internet users aged 55 to 64 are actually more likely to shop online than male internet users aged 16 to 24.", "It’s important to stress that these figures only reflect people’s behaviours once they start using the internet; the data doesn’t show ecommerce penetration against the broader population.", "Nevertheless, these findings clearly show the near universal appeal of ecommerce amongst internet users, regardless of their age or gender.", "And the obvious takeaway here is that online shopping represents a large and compelling opportunity for almost all consumer brands, regardless of category or target audience.", "However, there are some important differences in how people of different ages go about their online shopping.", "GWI’s data show that younger generations are considerably more likely to use a mobile phone to make online purchases, but these figures tail off quite quickly amongst their parents’ generation.", "Conversely, Baby Boomers are considerably more likely to buy things online via a laptop or desktop computer.", "Nearly twice as many internet users aged 55 to 64 say they bought something via a computer in the past month compared to internet users aged 16 to 24.", "However, these figures relate solely to checkout, and there’s a high likelihood that older generations will still be using mobile devices to inform the rest of their ‘buyer journey’.", "For example, while it’s not mobile-specific, data from GWI shows that older age groups are the most likely to research products online before making a purchase.", "More than 6 in 10 male internet users over the age of 45 say that they go online to look for information about products and services that they’re thinking of buying, compared to just 51 percent of men aged 16 to 24.", "It’s also interesting to note that a significant share of older internet users play video games.", "Perhaps unsurprisingly, gaming adoption rates amongst older generations aren’t as high as they are for Gen Z, where more than 90 percent of internet users say they play games.", "However, GWI’s data still shows that more than two-thirds of internet users aged 55 to 64 around the world play video games.", "But once again, there are plenty of differences lurking beneath the surface of these headline findings.", "For example, as we saw in the earlier section on internet connection speeds, older gamers have different preferences when it comes to the kinds of games they play, with ‘puzzle’ formats particularly popular amongst Baby Boomers.", "Another age-related trend is evident in our latest social media data, which shows that older age groups are the fastest-growing segments of many platforms’ audiences.", "For example, Facebook saw users over the age of 65 increase by roughly 25 percent over the past year – that’s almost double the average across all age groups of 13 percent since this time last year.", "Meanwhile, users over the age of 50 also represent Snapchat’s fastest-growing audience segment.", "The number of users aged 50 and above that advertisers can reach on Snapchat has grown by roughly 25 percent in the past 3 months, with male users in this age group increasing by a third.", "Note that these Snapchat figures represent quarterly growth, while the Facebook figures above showcase annual growth.", "It’s also worth noting that these figures represent relative growth, not the absolute increase in user numbers.", "Older age groups typically account for a smaller percentage of overall social media users than younger demographics, so it’s perhaps ‘easier’ for older age groups to record faster growth.", "For context, users aged 25 to 34 still accounted for the greatest number of new Facebook users over the past year, even though they were already the platform’s largest demographic segment.", "However, these relative growth figures still show that a greater number of older users are joining social platforms.", "These evolving demographics may bring new opportunities for marketers, together with new revenue streams for platforms and publishers.", "One of the standout digital stories in 2020 was the rise of ecommerce, with the COVID-19 pandemic driving consumers all over the world to embrace online shopping.", "With GWI data showing that most internet users already made online purchases even before the pandemic, there wasn’t much scope for an overall increase in ecommerce adoption rates amongst internet users.", "However, GWI data still shows that ecommerce adoption rates increased by 3.3 percentage points between Q2 and Q3 2020, representing quarterly growth of more than 4½ percent.", "At a global level, nearly 77 percent of internet users aged 16 to 64 say they buy something online each month.", "Internet users in Indonesia are the most likely to make ecommerce purchases, with more than 87 percent of the country’s respondents to GWI’s survey saying they bought something online in the past month.", "At the other end of the scale, just 57 percent of internet users in Egypt say they made an online purchase in the past 30 days.", "The ecommerce adoption rate is also relatively low in Russia, where just 60 percent of internet users say they bought something via the internet in the past month.", "As we saw in the previous section, there isn’t a significant difference in ecommerce adoption rates by age and gender, at least at a global level.", "However, a more interesting story lies in what people have been buying over recent months.", "Before we dig into the numbers, it’s worth pointing out that different sources report quite different findings for ecommerce activity, so data points on some slides may appear to contradict similar data points on other charts.", "These differences don’t represent an error; rather, they illustrate that different metrics may tell a different story about what people have been doing across different parts of the internet.", "Statista reports that the Fashion and Beauty category accounted for the largest share of global B2C ecommerce revenues in 2020, at more than US$665 billion.", "This is the first time in our ongoing series of Global Digital Reports that the Travel category hasn’t come out top, highlighting just how difficult recent months have been for travel and tourism brands.", "Indeed, Statista reports that online revenues in the Travel, Mobility and Accommodation category were down by more than 50 percent year-on-year, resulting in a drop of well over half a trillion US dollars in annual consumer spending.", "On the other hand, many other categories saw strong growth in ecommerce revenues in 2020.", "Food & Personal Care was the fastest growing category, with COVID-19 lockdowns and social distancing measures acting as a catalyst for significant increases in online grocery shopping.", "Worldwide, the category saw annual revenues in excess of US $400 billion in 2020, up by more than 40 percent compared to the previous year.", "Data from Contentsquare also offers good news for online grocery brands, with traffic to supermarkets’ ecommerce properties 35 percent higher in December than it was in January.", "People haven’t just been visiting online grocery stores either; Contentsquare’s data shows that supermarkets’ online transactions were more than double their January 2020 levels in both November and December 2020.", "These numbers support findings that we shared in our Digital 2020 July Global Statshot Report, when we reported that significant numbers of internet users had been saying they intended to continue with new online shopping behaviours that they’d adopted during the first wave of COVID-19 lockdowns.", "Moreover, these numbers don’t just offer good news for supermarkets.", "Grocery shopping tends to be a high-frequency activity, which means that people have had the chance to develop new habits over recent months.", "As most marketers know, it can be very difficult to inspire behaviour change – especially in high-frequency activities – so the new shopping habits of recent months present an unparalleled opportunity for brands and retailers to challenge the status quo.", "And what’s more, we’re already seeing evidence that people’s habits have changed in other categories too.", "Online cosmetics purchases soared during the recent year-end holiday season, with shoppers around the world making more than 3½ times as many online category purchases in November 2020 as they did in January 2020.", "Some of this variance can likely be attributed to the category’s normal seasonality, but such a dramatic jump between January and December suggests that a significant number of purchases that people might previously have made in physical stores have now shifted online.", "This echoes findings from Adobe, who reported that:", "“…it would’ve taken between 4 and 6 years to get to the levels that we saw in May 2020 if growth had continued at the same levels [we’d seen] for the past few years.”", "Furthermore, it’s now highly unlikely that people’s shopping behaviours will return to pre-pandemic patterns once daily life returns to some semblance of normality.", "While we can expect to see people return to physical stores once health concerns ease, many people will likely continue to conduct a greater share of their shopping activities online than they did prior to 2020.", "These changes aren’t just about where people make their purchases, either.", "Our analysis suggests that people have moved a significant share of their activities across every step of the buyer journey into online channels, meaning that marketers may need to rethink every aspect of their activities – not just “last-mile” demand generation.", "Google dominates global digital – but a bit less than before", "It might not come as a surprise to learn that Google dominates almost every aspect of digital, but it’s still interesting to quantify the company’s position.", "More than 7 in 10 mobile handsets in use around the world today use the Android operating system, according to the latest web traffic data from Statcounter.", "Facebook’s data puts Android’s share even higher, with the company’s Insights tools indicating that more than 8 in 10 mobile Facebook users aged 18-plus access via an Android-powered device.", "Google’s position in the search market is stronger yet, with Statcounter’s latest data indicating that the platform enjoys more than 90 percent share of the global search market.", "Chrome is also the world’s favourite web browser, accounting for almost two-thirds of web traffic across all devices.", "However, data suggest that Google’s global dominance may have started to slip in these key categories over the past 12 months.", "Statcounter’s data shows that the share of global web traffic served to Android devices fell by 1.6 percentage points in the year to December 2020, representing a 2.2 percent relative annual decline.", "Similarly, Statcounter’s data indicate that Google’s share of the global search market dropped by 1.3 percentage points over the past 12 months, representing a 1.4 percent relative decline.", "Chrome’s share of global web traffic also saw a year-on-year decline of 0.2 percentage points, although its longer-term growth trend still points upward.", "App Annie reports that the average amount of time that people spend watching videos on YouTube has increased by as much as 6 times in some countries over the past year.", "At a global level, people now spend an average of more than 23 hours per month using the YouTube app on Android phones, equating to almost one full day using the platform’s app each month.", "However, Google’s own data reveals that mobile phones only account for around 70 percent of YouTube watch time, suggesting that the overall total across all devices is somewhere in the region of 33 hours per month.", "And there’s more good news for Google when it comes to its communications platforms.", "App Annie’s data also shows that the company’s flagship video calling platform – Google Meet – ranked seventh amongst the world’s most downloaded mobile apps in 2020.", "That puts it just three places behind Zoom, and ahead of both Snapchat and the rapidly rising Telegram.", "And with video calls looking set to remain a key feature of the communications landscape for the foreseeable future, Meet may turn out to be yet another jewel in Google’s crown.", "Hopefully that’s given you a solid understanding of the ‘state of digital’ today.", "Based on our ongoing analysis of these trends, here are some of the things we’ll be monitoring closely during the coming months.", "Based on current plans, 2021 will be the last year that Google’s Chrome browsers support third-party cookies, which Apple’s Safari browsers already block by default.", "Many advertisers have relied on these cookies to power their targeting and reporting activities, so this change may have significant implications for many of the world’s digital marketers.", "In the short term, this change may result in greater reliance on “walled garden” platforms such as Facebook and Amazon, because their on-platform technologies don’t rely on third-party cookies.", "However, almost all programmatic advertising companies will need to reinvent their models for a world without third-party cookies, so we may see a wave of new innovations in the ad tech industry over the coming months.", "For many white collar workers around the world, 2020 was the year of working from home, or “WFH” as it became commonly known.", "WFH looks like it will remain an enforced part of many people’s working lives for the foreseeable future too, with many countries still in the throes of high COVID-19 infection rates at the start of 2021.", "Moreover, many people may choose to continue with more flexible working practises even after the pandemic passes, and many employers may actively encourage such flexibility too.", "Evolving workplace dynamics have already inspired many changes in the world’s professional digital behaviours, from the rise of video conferencing to a greater reliance on software that helps teams manage remote workers.", "However, I expect to see further innovation in products and services designed to help with remote working over the coming months, especially in the areas of communication and ‘team cohesion’.", "Telemedicine was already a hot topic in healthcare prior to the outbreak of COVID, but the coronavirus crisis of 2020 has accelerated the industry’s advance in much the same way that it accelerated people’s move to online shopping.", "Doctors around the world are now offering ‘remote’ consultations, with many turning to video conferencing platforms and even messenger apps to deliver diagnoses and advice for their patients.", "Digital solutions designed to help with wellness and wellbeing have also seen significant growth in recent months, and trends suggest that this will continue to be one of the hottest areas of growth in 2021 too.", "The ever-fluctuating price of Bitcoin continues to grab media headlines around the world, but it’s clear that ‘DeFi’ – decentralised finance – has started to gain more mainstream acceptance.", "For context, it’s notoriously difficult to change people’s financial behaviours, with a popular industry axiom proclaiming that people are more likely to change their spouse than change their bank.", "However, data shows that increasing numbers of people are now turning to ‘alternative’ financial solutions, especially for products like insurance.", "Meanwhile, mobile payment platforms and ewallets are changing the ways in which people pay for things.", "This is most clearly evident online, with Worldpay reporting that ewallets accounted for the greatest share of online purchases around the world in 2019, with almost twice as much share as credit cards.", "But with many retailers and shoppers prioritising contactless payment methods in recent months due to COVID-19-related health concerns, mobile payment services such as Apple Pay and Google Pay have come to the fore in physical retail too.", "I don’t foresee an ‘overnight revolution’ in consumer finance this year, but I do expect to see an acceleration in people’s adoption and use of more digital products and services in the financial services sector.", "More than 1 billion people around the world faced some kind of disruption to their education in 2020 due to COVID-19, so we can expect increased emphasis on digital innovation in the world of learning over the coming months too.", "Some of this will relate to how individual educators deliver their materials, with innovations in ‘digital classroom’ solutions likely to continue apace in 2021.", "I’d expect to see some important changes in government policy too, with lawmakers all over the world addressing the societal imperatives and potential opportunities associated with enhanced online learning.", "These innovations will likely extend to the corporate world too, with remote training and ‘upskilling’ remaining one of the hottest topics for HR professionals in 2021", "And given the importance of education, we might expect to see digital giants like Google and Facebook become more actively involved in this field too, potentially even collaborating to deliver much needed support to governments and educators around the globe.", "With digital privacy once again making headlines at the start of 2021 thanks to another furore surrounding platforms’ terms and conditions, 2021 may be the year when ‘portable digital identities’ start to gain more mainstream traction.", "People everywhere are increasingly aware of – and concerned about – how much of their ‘data’ they share, whether knowingly or not.", "As a result, platforms and publishers may start to accept decentralised sign-on solutions, such as those offered by Inrupt.", "Large internet companies will likely resist these third-party solutions due to the inevitable financial consequences, but if a sufficient number of users choose privacy over ad-supported content,", "Are there any other trends that you’ll be watching in 2021? Send me your tips on Twitter.", "And if you’d like more tailored insights into what the future of digital might hold for your brand or business, get in touch with me on LinkedIn to learn more about Kepios’s Quarterly Digital Briefings.", "Let’s wrap up this year’s bumper analysis with some more lighthearted insights…", "Instagram passed another cultural milestone last week, when the total number of posts published to the platform featuring the hashtag #love passed the 2 billion mark.", "While this means that the typical Instagram user has only tagged an average of 2 of their posts with #love, it’s by far the most popular hashtag on Instagram, appearing on more than 50 percent more posts than its closest rival, #instagood.", "Interestingly, however, it’s taken longer for posts tagged with #love to reach the 2 billion mark than it did for them to reach 1 billion, despite huge growth in Instagram’s user base in the past few years.", "The billionth #love post was published sometime around the middle of August 2015, back when Instagram had just 300 million monthly active users.", "That means it took roughly 58 months to reach 1 billion #love posts, but 65 months to reach 2 billion, despite Instagram having four times as many users today as it did back in 2015.", "However, just as I reported back in August 2015, Instagram’s constantly updated feed of posts tagged with #love offers some fascinating insights into the human psyche and people’s motivations.", "Be warned, though: there’s plenty of #NSFW content in there too, so prepare yourself for some rather ‘explicit’ surprises.", "We couldn’t finish this year’s analysis without an update to our Pulitzer-worthy coverage of one of the internet’s most hotly contested battles.", "Despite raising the alarm this time last year, it appears that many people still haven’t received the memo about the internet being invented for sharing pictures of kittens.", "To make matters worse, the past 12 months have even seen #TeamDog consolidate its position as – well, top dog on the internet.", "The #CanineCrew managed to publish an additional 44 million #dog posts to Instagram, while #FelineFriends only managed 33 million new #cat posts.", "It’s a similar story over on Twitter, where the platform’s advertising tools reveal that 307 million users are ‘interested’ in dogs, compared to just 23 million who are ‘interested’ in cats.", "That’s a marked improvement on last year’s ratio of 250 million vs. 250 thousand, but dog lovers still outnumber cat lovers on Twitter by a factor of 13 to 1.", "Bizarrely, even reptiles are more popular on Twitter than cats (35 million vs. 23 million).", "Maybe all the cats have been banned from Twitter for perceived threats to Larry.", "Perhaps most tellingly though, cats appear to be losing the battle for the web – arguably their home territory – with Google web page results for ‘dog’ outnumbering results for ‘cat’ by 3.83 million to 3.68 million at the start of 2021.", "But as we’ve seen consistently throughout this year’s data, there are considerable differences between countries.", "India is clearly all about #TeamDog, with the country’s netizens more than three times as likely to enter a Google search for topics related to dogs as they are to search for topics related to cats.", "The data tells a different tail in Indonesia though, where online searches for cats are more than twice as common as searches for dogs.", "I could go on, but much as I enjoy this pun-ditry, I’ve probably taken up enough of your 6 hours and 54 minutes for today, so I’ll paws things there.", "I’ll be back in a couple of weeks with the first of our Digital 2021 local country reports.", "Until then, if you need any more stats, check out our complete free library of Global Digital Reports."]}

That means that the platform has roughly 300 million monthly active users outside of China.", "Furthermore, the latest data from App Annie suggest that Chinese users account for 80 percent of the total time spent using TikTok in 2019, while users in India account for a further 10 percent of the total.", "That means that users in China and India are responsible for roughly 9 in every 10 minutes spent using TikTok around the world.", "Regardless of country differences, however, TikTok climbed to sixth place in the global mobile app rankings by monthly active users for 2019.", "For context, TikTok is still behind WhatsApp, Facebook, WeChat and Instagram, but it’s already ahead of all the other social platforms.", "However, it’s important to stress that the data do not indicate that TikTok’s success has come at the expense of any of the Western social networks.", "In fact, Facebook, Instagram, and Snapchat have all reported increases in their advertising audience reach over the past few months, even amongst users aged 13 to 17.", "While the media has been distracted with all the hype surrounding TikTok, some other social platforms have been posting some impressive numbers that seem to have slipped under the radar.", "Top of the growth charts is Reddit, whose reported monthly active user numbers have surged by 30 percent (100 million new users) since this time last year, with the company’s latest reports revealing that the platform now attracts 430 million users each month.", "Meanwhile, Pinterest has enjoyed similar success, growing its total active user base by 29 percent over the past year.", "The platform has attracted more than 70 million new monthly active users (MAUs) over the past 12 months, to reach a total MAU figure of 322 million at the start of 2020.", "The company has also added a number of new countries to its advertising targeting options, resulting in a quarter-on-quarter increase in reported potential advertising reach of 12 percent between October 2019 and January 2020.", "Sina Weibo has also been enjoying impressive growth, with recent trends suggesting that the platform’s MAU numbers should pass the half-billion mark within the next few months.", "The 497 million MAUs that the platform reported in November was buoyed by an annual increase of 51 million new users, equating to year-on-year growth of 11 percent.", "Mirroring a trend that we highlighted in our Digital 2019 Q4 Digital Statshot report, various data points in our Digital 2020 reports show that the internet’s centre of gravity is moving progressively eastward.", "This trend is even more visible in the latest data, with Asian apps and websites commanding an ever-increasing share of global activity.", "In particular, the latest rankings of the world’s top websites illustrate the dramatic rise of Asia’s ecommerce platforms.", "In its latest list, Alexa [note: not the voice assistant] places China’s Tmall in third place in the global website rankings – that’s ahead of both Facebook and Baidu, and 10 place higher than its top Western competitor, Amazon.", "Across the full top 20 sites, Alexa includes 5 Chinese ecommerce sites, 4 of which belong to Alibaba.", "It’s worth noting that Alexa uses a 3-month rolling average of monthly website traffic to determine its rankings, and the latest data include activity around Singles’ Day.", "This huge online shopping festival – the Chinese equivalent of Black Friday or Cyber Monday – is increasingly popular throughout Asia, so it’s perhaps not surprising that China’s ecommerce giants are becoming much more visible at a global level.", "However, it’s not just China’s ecommerce sites that are breaking through at a global level:", "- Baidu, China’s top search engine, ranks fifth in Alexa’s latest list, and fourth in a similar ranking from SimilarWeb.", "- QQ, a popular messenger platform owned by WeChat’s parent company, Tencent, currently claims the sixth spot in Alexa’s rankings", "- Seventh spot in Alexa’s rankings is occupied by Sohu, a popular online portal that offers news, search, gaming, and various other services.", "- Qihoo 360, a Chinese internet security company that is best known for its antivirus software, popular web browser, and mobile app store, takes Alexa’s tenth spot.", "Asia’s rising influence is also evident in the latest rankings of mobile apps.

As GlobalWebIndex stated in their recent Commerce trends report,", "“While social networks often play a central role in the initial steps on the path to purchase, only 12 percent of internet users say that a ‘buy’ button on a social network would drive them to check-out online.”", "“At present, enthusiasm about buying ordinary goods and services via social networks is limited. However, this is something that robust branded content and inspiration can change.”", "The key takeaway here is that there is no silver bullet when it comes to “closing a sale”, and marketers would do well to consider the full scope of the consumer purchase cycle – from initial discovery through to purchase, and even post-purchase activities – when devising their plans.", "Moreover, marketers would do well to stop thinking in terms of ‘online’ and ‘offline’. With most shoppers demonstrating that they’re equally happy to engage with connected devices and physical-world properties in equal measure – often simultaneously – it’s increasingly clear that these ‘lines’ only exist in marketers’ heads and budgets.", "Every year when we’re producing these reports, we spot something fun in the data. In previous editions that’s been which emoji people use most on Twitter (we’ve included that in this year’s report too), or the discovery that Yahoo! is still more popular than porn (spoiler alert: it still is).", "However, this year’s fun fact goes to the very heart of why the internet exists, and marks a fundamental shift in the internet’s centre of gravity that’s arguably as radical as the rising influence of the East.", "If you’ve been online since the 90s (ahem), you may know that the internet was in fact invented to share pictures of kittens.", "However, recent trends in some of our most cutting-edge data reveal that things may be changing.", "Data from Google Trends reveals that people searched for dogs almost twice as frequently as they searched for cats in 2019.", "For reference, the average search index for ‘dog’ in 2019 was 90, compared to an average of 52 for ‘cat’.", "Similarly, Twitter’s ad targeting tools report that more than 250 million of the platform’s users are “interested” in dogs, compared to just 250,000 who are interested in cats – that’s a thousand-fold difference.", "Dogs even outperform cats on Instagram. A quick search reveals almost 250 million posts have been published to the platform using #dog, compared to just 200 million for #cat.", "Doug the Pug also has more followers than Grumpy Cat (RIP).", "However, there’s still hope for cat lovers: a Google search for ‘dog’ at the start of 2020 delivered a total of 6.76 billion results, but a search for ‘cat’ returned a total of 6.82 billion.", "Cats also still rule Reddit, where r/cats is home to 1.70 million users, compared to 1.29 million for r/dogs.", "We’ll share updates on this important story as and when we get them.

Try exploring cultures too, by constantly asking yourself what’s different about what you’re seeing compared to what you expected.", "Staying on top of the latest tech trends is one of the biggest causes of stress for marketers everywhere.", "Hopefully, our Global Digital Reports help, but maybe a better answer is less, not more.", "Do you really need to try that niche new platform with a couple of million users, or might you be better focusing your efforts (and budgets) on one or two proven platforms with billions of active users?", "Will that shiny new toy really propel your brand to perpetual success, or is it just a pleasant distraction from quarterly planning?", "More importantly, is it a sustainable solution that justifies a steep learning curve (VR, anyone?)", "On the flip-side, can you really justify ignoring the big trends, just because they don’t appeal to you on a personal level?", "Gaming, voice interfaces, and esports are all hugely popular with global audiences, yet continue to be underrepresented in the media coverage, in marketing plans, and in brands’ budgets.", "Top takeaway: In 2020, use data-driven insights to identify a handful of technologies and platforms that really matter to your brand’s success, and not simply to add the latest fads to your roadmap.", "This article was originally written by our consultant, Simon Kemp, for TheNextWeb."]}

10 percent over the past year, taking the global total to 3.96 billion by the start of July 2020.", "This means that – for the first time – more than half of the world’s population now uses social media, with more people using social media than not.", "Growth trends indicate that an average of more than 1 million people started using social media for the first time every single day over the past 12 months, equating to almost 12 new users every second.", "What’s more, the pace of growth appears to have accelerated in recent months, despite the global total having already passed the halfway mark.", "COVID-19-related lockdowns may have played a role in this increased adoption, but many of the data points that feed our global total were last updated in Q1, so there’s a reasonable chance that we’ll see rapid growth in our next Statshot report too.", "Given the significance of this milestone, we’ve produced a comprehensive analysis of the global state of social media, which you can read in full here.", "Internet user numbers continue to show strong growth as well, with our latest analysis revealing that 346 million people came online for the first time over the past year.", "4.57 billion people around the world now use the internet, accounting for close to 60 percent of the world’s total population.", "This is similar to the figure that we published back in April, but following conversations with both the ITU and GSMA Intelligence, we’ve made significant downward corrections to our internet user numbers for a handful of larger countries.", "These corrections were triggered by a broader trend we’ve been tracking in internet user numbers, where some reports appear to show unrealistic growth over relatively short periods of time, resulting in figures that seem improbable given the demographic and socio-economic realities within the relevant countries.", "However, even once we adjust historical figures for these source corrections, the latest data show that the number of global internet users continues to grow at a similar pace to the rates we’ve reported over our past few reports.", "The global total grew by 346 million over the past 12 months, equating to year-on-year growth of more than 8 percent.", "On average, this means that roughly 11 new users come online for the first time every second since July 2019.", "The figures we report for mobile phone users this quarter also appear to have remained static compared to the figures we published in April, but the latest data from GSMA Intelligence show that unique mobile users continue to grow, despite corrections to the overall total.", "The organisation reports that mobile users have grown by 2.4 percent over the past year, although the pace of growth slowed in the first three months of 2020 to quarter-on-quarter growth of 0.5 percent.", "This slowdown is likely due to the impact of Coronavirus lockdowns, especially in China, which contributes a sizeable share of overall global growth.", "New research shows that the increased use of connected devices that we reported in our April report continues today, despite many countries starting to lift the lockdown restrictions that triggered that initial surge in use.", "The latest wave of GlobalWebIndex’s Coronavirus Multi Market Study finds that 7 in 10 internet users are still spending more time using mobile phones compared to pre-pandemic levels, while nearly half of us are still spending more time using laptops.", "Meanwhile, our love affair with streaming continues, with more than half of GlobalWebIndex’s respondents

more time using social media, while 1 in 7 respondents say that they’re continuing to create and upload more video content.", "But connected tech hasn’t just been keeping people entertained during lockdown.", "More than 8 in 10 mobile phone users surveyed by Ericsson report that internet-connected technologies have helped them cope during the pandemic, enabling them to support their children’s education (76 percent), stay in touch with friends and family (74 percent), and even improve their mental health and wellbeing (43 percent).", "Indeed, numerous stories have emerged over recent weeks highlighting the role that connected tech can play in combatting issues such as loneliness amongst the elderly.", "So, while there’s plenty of evidence that excessive use of connected tech can be harmful, it’s worth remembering that the same technologies can also improve people’s quality of life.", "We’ve been tracking the rise of voice search and voice command for some time in our Global Digital Reports series, especially because of the sharp increases in use across some of the world’s fastest growing internet markets.", "The latest data from GlobalWebIndex indicate that well over half of the internet users in India, China, and Indonesia now use voice tech each month, with 6 in 10 users in India saying that they used voice interfaces in the past 30 days.", "However, voice isn’t the only technology that’s reshaping search.", "GlobalWebIndex’s research also reveals that image recognition services such as Pinterest Lens and Google Lens have become increasingly important tools for internet users, especially amongst younger audiences.", "More than one-third of internet users aged 16 to 64 report using image recognition tools in the past month, but that figure rises to almost 40 percent for women aged 16 to 34.", "These tools are especially important when it comes to ecommerce, and have particular value for brands in aesthetically oriented categories such as fashion, home decor, and even consumer technology.", "But perhaps the most significant change in search behaviours involves the online platforms that people use when they want to learn more about brands and products.", "GlobalWebIndex finds that social networks are playing an increasingly important role in people’s brand research behaviours, and are now second only to search engines.", "However, the overall gap between search engines and social networks has been steadily closing over recent months, pointing to an ongoing shift in how people look for information about the things they want to buy.", "What’s more, social networks are now the top choice amongst internet users aged 16 to 24 when it comes to brand research – even ahead of search engines – with younger women particularly likely to turn to social media for their research needs.", "With roughly 98 percent of internet users across all age groups using a search engine every month, there’s no doubt that these tools continue to play an essential role in people’s online activities.", "However, the latest data highlights the fact that people are using a wider variety of tools to help inform their purchase decisions.", "As a result, it’s essential that marketers think more broadly about how audiences and consumers might want to discover and learn about their brands, and in particular, how they can weave search-friendly elements into their social media activities.", "As COVID-19-related lockdowns took hold and hundreds of millions of people started working from home, various pundits predicted the demise of the office.", "However, the latest research indicates that tales of the office’s death appear to have been somewhat exaggerated.", "In a study conducted at the end of June, GlobalWebIndex found that just over a quarter of the world’s internet users expect to work from home more frequently after the pandemic has passed, compared to how often they worked from home before lockdown.", "That figure varies considerably by country though, with more than half of respondents in India and the Philippines reporting that they expect ‘WFH’ to become a more common occurrence.", "However, as with so many aspects of our digital lives, this change in behaviour won’t necessarily involve a binary shift.", "In reality, lockdowns have helped many people and businesses understand how to adapt ‘working from home’ to their needs, but once social distancing eases there will still be plenty of occasions when people need to – or choose to – work from more communal settings.", "As a result, the future of work is more likely to be ‘WFW’ than ‘WFH’ – i.e. working from wherever makes most sense given the context.", "In other words, just as “home is where the heart is”, so “work is where the wifi is”.", "This evolution will have important implications for brands, especially those in the B2B space.", "For example, products and services that enable people to work more efficiently and effectively from home – office chairs, computer monitors, team communication platforms, secure remote connections, etc. – may continue to enjoy increased demand over the coming months.", "Similarly, new commercial opportunities may also arise as people’s WFH habits evolve and become more established.", "These will vary by country and by culture, however, so be sure to check the latest findings for your country before getting too deep into planning.", "The enduring appeal of video conferencing appears to mirror people’s WFH expectations, with GlobalWebIndex’s research finding that just over a quarter of internet users expect to use these platforms and tools more frequently after the pandemic has passed, compared to their pre-COVID habits.", "The research points to a fairly disparate range of expectations though, from less than 1 in 10 internet users in Japan expecting to meet over video in the future, to almost half of all internet users in India.", "Interestingly, however, these differences do not appear to be determined by technological factors.", "Indeed, Indian internet users seem to have embraced video conferencing and video calling more than users in any other nation, despite the fact that the country continues to be plagued by some of the slowest internet connections in the world.", "Our reading of this data suggests that – as is so often the case in connected tech – adoption rates and digital activities are more likely to be determined by people’s age than by infrastructure.", "On average, the higher a country’s median age, the less likely that country’s internet users are to foresee major, enduring changes to their digital behaviours as a result of recent events.", "We can see support for this hypothesis in the global figures for increased use of video conferencing by age and gender as well, where the data shows a clear difference between the expectations of younger and older users.", "Either way, the surge in the use of video conferencing has resulted in a variety of additions to people’s digital platform ‘portfolios’.", "As we reported in our April report, Zoom appears to be one of the biggest beneficiaries of these new behaviours, but the platform is by no means the only tech brand that has seen its day-to-day use skyrocket over recent weeks.", "While it’s safe to assume that increased use presents an exciting opportunity for these brands to grow their revenues, they may not be the only brands that will be able to capitalise on these new behaviours.", "Zoom already promotes a selection of branded virtual backdrops on its website, and we’re guessing it may only be a matter of time before one of the larger platforms adopts an ad-funded video conferencing model for those users who haven’t signed up for paid packages.", "Facebook’s advertising tools show that brands can now reach more than 1 billion people using ads on Instagram.", "The company’s latest data indicates that Instagram added 111 million new users to its advertising reach in the past quarter, equating to quarterly growth of more than 10 percent.", "The figures mean that Instagram’s ad audience is currently growing at a rate of more than 1 million new users per day, resulting in global reach of 1.08 billion by early July 2020.", "LinkedIn’s tally of total registered users also reached an impressive milestone this quarter, passing 700 million global users.", "The platform’s global user base grew by more than 25 million over the past 3 months, equating to quarter-on-quarter growth of almost 4 percent.", "It’s important to note that this figure does not represent monthly active users though, so this figure does not compare directly to the figures we report for other platforms in this report.", "Sadly, LinkedIn stopped publishing monthly active user figures when it was acquired by Microsoft, but DataReportal analysis suggests that the platform wouldn’t quite make our latest ranking of the world’s most active social platforms.", "Twitter appears to have lost the audience gains that it posted last quarter, with the company’s advertising tools suggesting that global advertising reach has now dipped back below the figures those same tools were showing back in January.", "However, it is worth noting that the numbers reported in Twitter’s advertising tools are subject to considerable fluctuation, even over relatively short periods of time.", "Furthermore, a 90 percent drop in the reported number of Twitter users in Russia played a significant role in this quarter’s reduction.", "Twitter’s tools show that the addressable advertising audience in the country dropped by more than 20 million over the past 3 months, accounting for more than a third of the overall global adjustment.", "This is particularly noteworthy given the big rise (+149 percent) in Twitter users in Russia that we reported in our April report.", "TikTok had been enjoying a stellar quarter, with all signs pointing to impressive user growth all over the world.", "However, the Indian government’s move to ban the app across the country at the end of June may put a dent in the platform’s future growth trajectory.", "Bytedance still hasn’t published any updated figures for global TikTok use, but DataReportal analysis of a variety of data sources indicates that the platform had passed 800 million monthly active users outside of China before the ban in India came into place.", "Previously, we reported a combined active user figure for both TikTok and Douyin, but in light of recent events and changes to the company’s structure, we now report them separately.", "Had we continued to report the two platforms together, however, the combined monthly active user total would now be roughly 1.2 billion, which would represent growth of 50 percent in just the past year.", "It’s unclear whether the Indian government’s decision will result in a permanent ban for TikTok, so we’ve elected to report the unadjusted figures for now, especially because the ban only came into place one day before the end of our reporting period.", "However, our analysis indicates that India may account for as much as a quarter of TikTok’s global active user base, so any ongoing restrictions could become a major hurdle for TikTok’s future expansion.", "In contrast to the jump in ad engagement that we reported back in April, the latest data suggest that Facebook users clicked on fewer ads in June than they did in March.", "The company’s ad tools report that the global median remained steady at 13 ad clicks per user, per month, but closer inspection of the data by age and by gender reveals that clicks actually declined across most demographic groups, compared to the median levels for March.", "Facebook ad engagement levels are still higher than they were at the start of the year though, which should offer some level of encouragement for marketers.", "We’ve collected a wealth of new ecommerce insights for this quarter’s report, all of which point to an increased role for ecommerce even after the COVID-19 pandemic has passed.", "Data from Contentsquare shows that overall ecommerce transactions are up by roughly 20 percent in July compared to the start of 2020.", "The company reports that the weekly number of online transactions has been declining steadily since lockdowns started to ease – especially now that people are able to return to physical stores – but online conversion rates continue to increase.", "Moreover, research from GlobalWebIndex shows that almost half of all internet users expect to make more use of ecommerce even after the outbreak is over, with consumers in some of the world’s largest developing economies most likely to foresee increases in their online shopping activities.", "Older shoppers seem to have shown the biggest increases in propensity to shop online compared to our April report, with nearly 4 in 10 internet users aged 55 to 64 now reporting that they expect to make more frequent ecommerce purchases after the pandemic ends.", "Even more encouragingly, ecommerce transactions have increased across almost every category, with sports equipment brands and supermarkets seeing particularly strong gains compared to pre-Coronavirus levels.", "Tourism transactions continue to be badly affected by safety fears and ongoing travel restrictions, but the encouraging news is that transaction volumes appear to have increased threefold since our previous report three months ago.", "Weekly transaction volumes in the tourism sector are still 30 percent lower than they were in the first 6 weeks of 2020 though, and with the number of new COVID-19 cases continuing to rise at the time of writing, it’s likely that conditions will remain tough for travel brands for the remainder of this year.", "With more than half of the world’s total population now using social media, now is an ideal time to rethink how we use these powerful platforms.", "In particular, I’d recommend thinking of social media as a layer that runs through everything that people do – both online and in the physical world – rather than being a series of distinct ‘destinations’ and standalone activities.", "Try to avoid getting swept up in the hyperbole of binary predictions. Just as digital hasn’t replaced TV, working from home likely won’t replace the office, and ecommerce won’t replace all physical stores.", "People’s behaviours are evolving though, and it’s important to understand how these changes will impact demand for your brand’s products and services, as well as how you’ll need to adapt your marketing activities to achieve maximum efficiency and effectiveness.", "My advice would be to adopt a ‘balanced diet’ in all things digital, and to take advantage of every opportunity to learn about what your audience really cares about.", "Keep an eye on ‘stealth’ trends. Media stories about connected tech often focus on the platforms and the devices, but how people use these technologies is far more important.", "However, many of these behavioural trends emerge over time, without reaching a sudden ‘tipping point’ that spurs us into action.", "For example, the changes in people’s search behaviours that we explored above could have fundamentally important consequences for brands across almost every category, but they haven’t replaced search engines (yet).", "And to make things even more complex, these behaviours are evolving all the time, so there’s no ‘quick fix’ that can deliver a permanent advantage.", "As a result, as you start to think about 2021, it’s worth investing in plans and tech stacks that can adapt and flex over time – especially given the uncertainty around the ongoing evolution of COVID-19.", "It was #WorldEmojiDay last week 📅, so we’ve produced an update to our chart showing EmojiTracker’s ranking 🏆of the all-time most-used emoji 📈 on Twitter.", "🔥 has been used in more than 70 million tweets over the past 6 months, accounting for more than a quarter of its all-time total.", "😍 has moved above ♻️ to claim third spot ⬆️ in the rankings.", "The ⚔️ between ❤️ and ♥️continues, but 💙 and 💜 are both ⏫.", "That’s probably enough nerdiness 🤓 for now, but if you fancy getting involved in a bit of an emoji mystery 🕵️♀️, you might want to check out this intriguing Easter egg 🥚 that I spotted in Apple’s musical notes emoji 🎵🎶.", "That’s all for now though – we’ll be back with another Statshot report in October."]}
