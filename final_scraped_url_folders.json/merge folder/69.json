Here’s What You Can Learn.", "Editor’s Note: This article was first published on January 25, 2018.", "You know the story. Back in 2011, Netflix restructured their pricing in a big way. They unbundled streaming plans from the traditional DVD-by-mail business, increasing the price of the combined offering from $10 a month to $16 a month.", "And they rebranded their DVD-by-mail business to Qwikster.", "The public reaction was staggeringly negative. Netflix lost a whopping 800,000 subscribers in Q3 2011.", "Their stock price plummeted immediately following their Q3 2011 earnings release. Over the course of four months, Netflix’s stock price dropped by almost 80% compared to July 2011.", "In the chart below, you can see the painful progression (courtesy of Yahoo! Finance).", "When asked about the 2011 price change, Netflix’s CEO Reed Hastings said he wasn’t sure if the company had run customer focus groups before announcing the new plans.", "And, if they had run focus groups, he wasn’t sure what those focus groups had said. All of this uncertainty didn’t instill much confidence…", "Fast forward to present day. In October of 2017, Netflix announced another pricing change. They raised the price of their core Standard plan from $9.99 per month to $10.99 per month.", "This change crossed a critical threshold in the minds of consumers and create a sizable gap in price between Netflix and Hulu Plus (which rings in at $7.99 a month).", "With this new change, Netflix announced that existing customers would be automatically migrated into new plans – a move in stark contrast to a 2014 pricing change that grandfathered in existing customers, allowing them to keep lower prices for two years before being migrated to the newer, more expensive plans.", "Given the company’s fraught history with pricing, I could not wait to hear how the 2017 pricing changes are impacting Netflix’s bottom line went.", "On Monday, January 22, Netflix announced the results in their Q4 2017 earnings.", "By all measures, colossal success. Subscriber growth was not hurt by the pricing increase whatsoever.", "In fact, Netflix added 2 million new streaming subscribers in the US and 6.4 million overseas, 33% more than what Wall Street analysts had forecast.", "Both new and existing customers happily swallowed the price increase, which lifted Netflix’s revenue by 35% (faster than their 25% growth in average paid streaming memberships).", "When asked about the impact of the price increase, CEO Reed Hastings told analysts, “We saw very little effect on sign ups and growth", "[from the price increase] and thus, the really strong results.” #Humblebrag.", "With more subscribers, and with all subscribers now paying 10% more on average, Netflix saw a massive increase in profits.", "Operating income jumped to $245M, up from $154M the previous year. (Sidenote: Even very small pricing increases can have an outsized impact on a company’s profitability.", "You can guess what happened to Netflix’s stock price. It soared.", "Netflix could have taken their pricing windfall and called it a day. It would seem prudent to avoid rocking the boat knowing that the competitive landscape was about to get tougher as consumers would now have the choice of new streaming services from Apple, Disney, CBS, YouTube and many others.", "The resounding success of their 2017 pricing increase gave Netflix the conviction that they had not yet reached a ceiling on price, the point at which price becomes an impediment to subscriber growth.", "They still had room to try their luck again. In January 2019 the company announced higher pricing for each of their plans, which represented the largest price increase in the company’s history according to Variety.", "With these changes, Basic would go up to $8.99 per month (+13%), Standard would jolt to $12.99 (+18%) and Premium would go to $15.99 (+14%).", "The plans themselves remained exactly the same as they were in 2017 (see below).", "This again turned out to be a major win for the streaming giant. The price increase announcement had an immediate positive impact on the stock price (the headline in CNBC was “Netflix raised prices and the stock soared”).", "In the company’s first quarterly earnings call after the price increase, CFO Spencer Neumann indicated that churn levels were very consistent with the 2017 pricing increase despite the fact that this one was much more significant and even impacted the Basic plan.", "Furthermore, the company reported that it beat expectations on both domestic and international paid subscriber additions (9.6 million versus a forecast of 8.9 million).", "All of this translates to a massive impact on the bottom line. Let’s do some quick math. If we assume the company has 60 million US subscribers who will now pay $1 more per month and that pricing hasn’t impacted churn or subscriber growth, that means a jaw-dropping $720 million increase in annual revenue.", "All of that extra revenue is pure profit – it doesn’t require new investments in content or hosting or marketing or sales.", "Given that the company made $1.2 billion in net income in 2018, this 13% increase in revenue per customer actually means a 60% increase in profitability.", "Not too bad for a dollar meal sized price increase.", "What you can learn from Netflix’s pricing strategy", "There are a number of lessons SaaS companies should take away from Netflix’s successful 2017 and 2019 pricing changes, as well as from their epic 2011 fail.", "How many business decisions can send your stock price spiraling down by 80% one year and then rocketing up another?", "The Netflix case proves that pricing changes can make or break a business, and therefore it’s important to invest in making the right pricing decisions.", "It also reinforces that even small changes in pricing can add up to major improvements in a company’s profitability.", "2. Don’t let one mistake stop you from touching pricing again", "After the Qwikster disaster of 2011, Netflix could have decided that they were never going to touch pricing again.", "They did, in fact, leave pricing alone until 2014. But over time, Netflix collected evidence that they had an opportunity to revisit pricing in a more thoughtful way.", "When they were ready to do so in 2014, Netflix took a conservative approach to mitigate the risk of another backlash.", "The success of their 2014 pricing change gave Netflix the confidence to take a more aggressive approach the next time around and then an even more aggressive approach in 2019.", "3. Pricing power comes down to value and customer satisfaction", "In their Q4 2017 earnings call, Netflix’s CEO Reed Hastings was asked if he had plans for future price increases.", "His response perfectly summed up a value-based pricing philosophy. With a value-based approach, pricing power is an output that you can measure based on how much value you deliver to customers relative to alternatives on the market.", "It’s not a best guess, a snap decision, or an input based on a company’s cost structure.", "“I think it’s a tricky thing because it really has to be a reflection of the underlying quality of the experience on a relative basis.", "So, as long as we’re able to continue to improve our content and our whole experience at a remarkable rate…then asking our customers to help us fund that at higher levels is reasonable.", "But if we weren’t gaining relative value for the customers, then we wouldn’t be changing prices.”", "One reason why Netflix’s pricing change went over so smoothly was the timing. The 2017 price increase coincided with the launch of amazing new original content, including new seasons of popular series like Stranger Things and The Crown (which I both highly recommend) and the debut of a big budget action film starring Will Smith (Bright).", "Other companies should similarly launch pricing increases when they can tie those increases back to improvements in customer value, for instance through new product launches, increases in NPS, new partnerships, or better analytics.", "Finally, customers respond better to pricing increases when they have options. And that’s true even if the options aren’t all that great.", "In Netflix’s case, while they increased the price of their Standard plan, they kept their entry-level Basic plan at $7.99 per month.", "A budget-conscious customer could by all means downgrade if they could not afford Netflix’s price increase.", "Doing so would mean giving up a lot – no more HD streaming and only 1 concurrent device. Still, having a choice makes the customer feel in control, and makes it easier for them to swallow a price increase.", "What have you learned from Netflix’s pricing strategy?

If you look around carefully, you will see that scarcity is a fact of life.", "Scarcity means that human wants for goods, services and resources exceed what is available. Resources, such as labor, tools, land, and raw materials are necessary to produce the goods and services we want but they exist in limited supply.", "Of course, the ultimate scarce resource is time- everyone, rich or poor, has just 24 expendable hours in the day to earn income to acquire goods and services, for leisure time, or for sleep.", "At any point in time, there is only a finite amount of resources available. Think about it this way: In 2015 the labor force in the United States contained over 158 million workers, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics.", "The total land area was 3,794,101 square miles. While these are certainly large numbers, they are not infinite.", "Because these resources are limited, so are the numbers of goods and services we produce with them. Combine this with the fact that human wants seem to be virtually infinite, and you can see why scarcity is a problem.", "Introduction to FRED Data is very important in economics because it describes and measures the issues and problems that economics seek to understand.", "A variety of government agencies publish economic and social data. For this course, we will generally use data from the St. Louis Federal Reserve Bank's FRED database.", "FRED is very user friendly.

So how do we solve it?", "LINK IT UP Visit this website (http://openstax.org/l/drought) to read about how the United States is dealing with scarcity in resources.", "Every society, at every level, must make choices about how to use its resources. Families must decide whether to spend their money on a new car or a fancy vacation.", "Towns must choose whether to put more of the budget into police and fire protection or into the school system.", "Nations must decide whether to devote more funds to national defense or to protecting the environment.", "In most cases, there just isn’t enough money in the budget to do everything. How do we use our limited resources the best way possible, that is, to obtain the most goods and services we can?", "There are a couple of options. First, we could each produce everything we each consume. Alternatively, we could each produce some of what we want to consume, and “trade” for the rest of what we want.", "Let’s explore these options. Why do we not each just produce all of the things we consume? Think back to pioneer days, when individuals knew how to do so much more than we do today, from building their homes, to growing their crops, to hunting for food, to repairing their equipment.", "Most of us do not know how to do all—or any—of those things, but it is not because we could not learn.", "Rather, we do not have to.

Modern businesses divide tasks as well.", "Even a relatively simple business like a restaurant divides the task of serving meals into a range of jobs like top chef, sous chefs, less-skilled kitchen help, servers to wait on the tables, a greeter at the door, janitors to clean up, and a business manager to handle paychecks and bills—not to mention the economic connections a restaurant has with suppliers of food, furniture, kitchen equipment, and the building where it is located.", "A complex business like a large manufacturing factory, such as the shoe factory (Figure 1.4), or a hospital can have hundreds of job classifications.", "FIGURE 1.4 Division of Labor Workers on an assembly line are an example of the divisions of labor.

First, specialization in a particular small job allows workers to focus on the parts of the production process where they have an advantage.", "(In later chapters, we will develop this idea by discussing comparative advantage.) People have different skills, talents, and interests, so they will be better at some jobs than at others.", "The particular advantages may be based on educational choices, which are in turn shaped by interests and talents.", "Only those with medical degrees qualify to become doctors, for instance. For some goods, geography affects specialization.", "For example, it is easier to be a wheat farmer in North Dakota than in Florida, but easier to run a tourist hotel in Florida than in North Dakota.", "If you live in or near a big city, it is easier to attract enough customers to operate a successful dry cleaning business or movie theater than if you live in a sparsely populated rural area.", "Whatever the reason, if people specialize in the production of what they do best, they will be more effective than if they produce a combination of things, some of which they are good at and some of which they are not.", "Second, workers who specialize in certain tasks often learn to produce more quickly and with higher quality.", "This pattern holds true for many workers, including assembly line laborers who build cars, stylists who cut hair, and doctors who perform heart surgery.", "In fact, specialized workers often know their jobs well enough to suggest innovative ways to do their work faster and better.", "A similar pattern often operates within businesses. In many cases, a business that focuses on one or a few products (sometimes called its “core competency”) is more successful than firms that try to make a wide range of products.", "Third, specialization allows businesses to take advantage of economies of scale, which means that for many goods, as the level of production increases, the average cost of producing each individual unit declines.", "For example, if a factory produces only 100 cars per year, each car will be quite expensive to make on average.", "However, if a factory produces 50,000 cars each year, then it can set up an assembly line with huge machines and workers performing specialized tasks, and the average cost of production per car will be lower.", "The ultimate result of workers who can focus on their preferences and talents, learn to do their specialized jobs better, and work in larger organizations is that society as a whole can produce and consume far more than if each person tried to produce all of their own goods and services.", "The division and specialization of labor has been a force against the problem of scarcity.", "Trade and Markets Specialization only makes sense, though, if workers can use the pay they receive for doing their jobs to purchase the other goods and services that they need.", "In short, specialization requires trade. You do not have to know anything about electronics or sound systems to play music—you just buy an iPod or MP3 player, download the music, and listen.", "You do not have to know anything about artificial fibers or the construction of sewing machines if you need a jacket—you just buy the jacket and wear it.", "You do not need to know anything about internal combustion engines to operate a car—you just get in and drive.", "Instead of trying to acquire all the knowledge and skills involved in producing all of the goods and services that you wish to consume, the market allows you to learn a specialized set of skills and then use the pay you receive to buy the goods and services you need or want.", "This is how our modern society has evolved into a strong economy.", "FIGURE 1.5 Esther Duflo, Abhijit Banerjee, and Michael Kremer Esther Duflo, Abhijit Banerjee (both from Massachusetts Institute of Technology), and Michael Kremer (University of Chicago) were awarded the Nobel Prize for groundbreaking work in which they established experimental methods to understand poverty and outcomes of initiatives to address it.", "(Credit: modification of work by U.S. Embassy Sweden/Wikimedia Commons, CC BY 2.0; Financial Times/Wikimedia Commons, CC BY 2.0; U.S. Embassy Sweden/Flickr Creative Commons, CC BY 2.0)", "Now that you have an overview on what economics studies, let’s quickly discuss why you are right to study it.", "Economics is not primarily a collection of facts to memorize, although there are plenty of important concepts to learn.", "Instead, think of economics as a collection of questions to answer or puzzles to work.

Choice 4 in Table 6.4 shows that if we move to point R, we would gain 21 utils from one more T-shirt, but lose 23 utils from two fewer movies, so we would end up with less total utility at point R. In short, the general rule shows us the utility-maximizing choice, which is called the consumer equilibrium.", "There is another equivalent way to think about this. We can also express the general rule as the ratio of the prices of the two goods should be equal to the ratio of the marginal utilities.", "When we divide the price of good 1 by the price of good 2, at the utility-maximizing point this will equal the marginal utility of good 1 divided by the marginal utility of good 2.", "Along the budget constraint, the total price of the two goods remains the same, so the ratio of the prices does not change.", "However, the marginal utility of the two goods changes with the quantities consumed.

Assume that a firm can produce a home exercise cycle with three different combinations of labor and manufacturing equipment.", "Say that the firm pays labor $16 an hour (including benefits) and the machines", "14.3 • Market Power on the Supply Side of Labor Markets: Unions", "for manufacturing cost $200 each. Under these circumstances, the total cost of producing a home exercise cycle will be lowest if the firm adopts the plan of 50 hours of labor and one machine, as the table shows.", "Now, suppose that a union negotiates a wage of $20 an hour including benefits. In this case, it makes no difference to the firm whether it uses more hours of labor and fewer machines or less labor and more machines, although it might prefer to use more machines and to hire fewer union workers.", "(After all, machines never threaten to strike—but they do not buy the final product or service either.)", "In the final column of the table, the wage has risen to $24 an hour. In this case, the firm clearly has an incentive for using the plan that involves paying for fewer hours of labor and using three machines.", "If management responds to union demands for higher wages by investing more in machinery, then union workers can be more productive because they are working with more or better physical capital equipment than the typical nonunion worker.", "However, the firm will need to hire fewer workers. Hours of Labor", "TABLE 14.7 Three Production Choices to Manufacture a Home Exercise Cycle In some cases, unions have discouraged the use of labor-saving physical capital equipment—out of the reasonable fear that new machinery will reduce the number of union jobs.", "For example, in 2015, the union representing longshoremen who unload ships and the firms that operate shipping companies and port facilities staged a work stoppage that shut down the ports on the western coast of the United States.", "Two key issues in the dispute were the desire of the shipping companies and port operators to use handheld scanners for record-keeping and computer-operated cabs for loading and unloading ships—changes which the union opposed, along with overtime pay.", "President Obama threatened to use the Labor Management Relations Act of 1947—commonly known as the Taft-Hartley Act—where a court can impose an 80-day “cooling-off period” in order to allow time for negotiations to proceed without the threat of a work stoppage.", "Federal mediators were called in, and the two sides agreed to a deal in February 2015. The ultimate agreement allowed the new technologies, but also kept wages, health, and pension benefits high for workers.", "In the past, presidential use of the Taft-Hartley Act sometimes has made labor negotiations more bitter and argumentative but, in this case, it seems to have smoothed the road to an agreement.", "In other instances, unions have proved quite willing to adopt new technologies. In one prominent example, during the 1950s and 1960s, the United Mineworkers union demanded that mining companies install laborsaving machinery in the mines.", "The mineworkers’ union realized that over time, the new machines would reduce the number of jobs in the mines, but the union leaders also knew that the mine owners would have to pay higher wages if the workers became more productive, and mechanization was a necessary step toward greater productivity.", "In fact, in some cases union workers may be more willing to accept new technology than nonunion workers, because the union workers believe that the union will negotiate to protect their jobs and wages, whereas nonunion workers may be more concerned that the new technology will replace their jobs.", "In addition, union workers, who typically have higher job market experience and training, are likely to suffer less and benefit more than non-union workers from the introduction of new technology.", "Overall, it is hard to make a definitive case that union workers as a group are always either more or less welcoming to new technology than are nonunion workers", "The Decline in U.S. Union Membership The proportion of U.S. workers belonging to unions has declined dramatically since the early 1950s.", "Economists have offered a number of possible explanations: • • • •", "The shift from manufacturing to service industries The force of globalization and increased competition from foreign producers A reduced desire for unions because of the workplace protection laws now in place U.S. legal environment that makes it relatively more difficult for unions to organize workers and expand their membership", "Let’s discuss each of these four explanations in more detail. A first possible explanation for the decline in the share of U.S. workers belonging to unions involves the patterns of job growth in the manufacturing and service sectors of the economy as Figure 14.13 shows.", "The U.S. economy had about 15 million manufacturing jobs in 1960. This total rose to 19 million by the late 1970s and then declined to 17 million in 2013.", "Meanwhile, the number of jobs in service industries (including government employment) rose from 35 million in 1960 to over 118 million by 2013, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.", "Because over time unions were stronger in manufacturing than in service industries, the growth in jobs was not happening where the unions were.", "It is interesting to note that government workers comprise several of the biggest unions in the country, including the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees (AFSCME); the Service Employees International Union; and the National Education Association.", "Table 14.8 lists the membership of each of these unions. Outside of government employees, however, unions have not had great success in organizing the service sector.", "FIGURE 14.13 The Growth of Service Jobs Jobs in services have increased dramatically for more than the past 50 years.", "Jobs in government have increased modestly until 1990 and then declined slightly since then. Jobs in manufacturing peaked in the late 1970s and have declined more than a third since then.", "A second explanation for the decline in the share of unionized workers looks at import competition. Starting in the 1960s, U.S. carmakers and steelmakers faced increasing competition from Japanese and European manufacturers.", "As sales of imported cars and steel rose, the number of jobs in U.S. auto manufacturing fell.", "14.3 • Market Power on the Supply Side of Labor Markets: Unions", "This industry is heavily unionized. Not surprisingly, membership in the United Auto Workers, which was 975,000 in 1985, had fallen to roughly 390,000 by 2015.", "Import competition not only decreases the employment in sectors where unions were once strong, but also decreases the bargaining power of unions in those sectors.", "However, as we have seen, unions that organize public-sector workers, who are not threatened by import competition, have continued to see growth.", "A third possible reason for the decline in the number of union workers is that citizens often call on their elected representatives to pass laws concerning work conditions, overtime, parental leave, regulation of pensions, and other issues.", "Unions offered strong political support for these laws aimed at protecting workers but, in an ironic twist, the passage of those laws then made many workers feel less need for unions.", "These first three possible reasons for the decline of unions are all somewhat plausible, but they have a common problem.", "Most other developed economies have experienced similar economic and political trends, such as the shift from manufacturing to services, globalization, and increasing government social benefits and regulation of the workplace.", "Clearly there are cultural differences between countries as to their acceptance of unions in the workplace.", "The share of the population belonging to unions in other countries is very high compared with the share in the United States.", "Table 14.8 shows the proportion of workers in a number of the world’s high-income economies who belong to unions.", "The United States is near the bottom, along with France and Spain.

The great rise in union membership in the 1930s followed the passage of the National Labor Relations Act of 1935, which specified that workers had a right to organize unions and that management had to give them a fair chance to do so.", "The U.S. government strongly encouraged forming unions during the early 1940s in the belief that unions would help to coordinate the all-out production efforts needed during World War II.", "However, after World War II came the passage of the Taft-Hartley Act of 1947, which gave states the power to allow workers to opt out of the union in their workplace if they so desired.", "This law made the legal climate less encouraging to those seeking to form unions, and union membership levels soon started declining.", "The procedures for forming a union differ substantially from country to country. For example, the procedures in the United States and those in Canada are strikingly different.", "When a group of workers wishes to form a union in the United States, they announce this fact and set an election date when the firm's employees will vote in a secret ballot on whether to form a union.", "Supporters of the union lobby for a “yes” vote, and the firm's management lobbies for a “no” vote—often even hiring outside consultants for assistance in swaying workers to vote “no.”", "In Canada, by contrast, a union is formed when a sufficient proportion of workers (usually about 60%) signs an official card saying that they want a union.", "There is no separate “election date.” The management of Canadian firms is limited by law in its ability to lobby against the union.", "In addition, although it is illegal to discriminate and fire workers based on their union activity in the United States, the penalties are slight, making this a not so costly way of deterring union activity.", "In short, forming unions is easier in Canada—and in many other countries—than in the United States. In summary, union membership in the United States is lower than in many other high-income countries, a difference that may be due to different legal environments and cultural attitudes toward unions.", "LINK IT UP Visit this website (http://openstax.org/l/fastfoodwages) to read more about recent protests regarding minimum wage for fast food employees.", "14.4 Bilateral Monopoly LEARNING OBJECTIVES By the end of this section, you will be able to explain: • How firms determine wages and employment when a specific labor market combines a union and a monopsony What happens when there is market power on both sides of the labor market, in other words, when a union meets a monopsony?", "Economists call such a situation a bilateral monopoly.", "FIGURE 14.14 Bilateral Monopoly Employment, L*, will be lower in a bilateral monopoly than in a competitive labor", "market, but the equilibrium wage is indeterminate, somewhere in the range between Wu, what the union would choose, and Wm, what the monopsony would choose.", "Figure 14.14 is a combination of Figure 14.6 and Figure 14.11.

The proportion of workers attending college has increased in recent decades, so the supply curve for high-skilled labor has shifted to the right, from S0 to S1.", "If the demand for high-skilled labor had remained at D0, then this shift in supply would have led to lower wages for highskilled labor.", "However, the wages for high-skilled labor, especially if there is a large global demand, have increased even with the shift in supply to the right.", "The explanation must lie in a shift to the right in demand for high-skilled labor, from D0 to D1. The figure shows how a combination of the shift in supply, from S0 to S1, and the shift in demand, from D0 to D1, led to both an increase in the quantity of high-skilled labor hired and also to a rise in the wage for such labor, from W0 to W1.", "What factors would cause the demand for high-skilled labor to rise? The most plausible explanation is that while the explosion in new information and communications technologies over the last several decades has helped many workers to become more productive, the benefits have been especially great for high-skilled workers like top business managers, consultants, and design professionals.", "The new technologies have also helped to encourage globalization, the remarkable increase in international trade over the last few decades, by making it more possible to learn about and coordinate economic interactions all around the world.", "In turn, the rising impact of foreign trade in the U.S. economy has opened up greater opportunities for high-skilled workers to sell their services around the world, and lower-skilled workers have to compete with a larger supply of similarly skilled workers around the globe.", "We can view the market for high-skilled labor as a race between forces of supply and demand. Additional education and on-the-job training will tend to increase the high-skilled labor supply and to hold down its relative wage.", "Conversely, new technology and other economic trends like globalization tend to increase the demand for high-skilled labor and push up its relative wage.", "We can view the greater inequality of wages as a sign that demand for skilled labor is increasing faster than supply.", "Alternatively, if the supply of lower skilled workers exceeds the demand, then average wages in the lower quintiles of the income distribution will decrease.", "The combination of forces in the high-skilled and low-skilled labor markets leads to increased income disparity.", "15.5 Government Policies to Reduce Income Inequality LEARNING OBJECTIVES By the end of this section, you will be able to: • Explain the arguments for and against government intervention in a market economy • Identify beneficial ways to reduce the economic inequality in a society • Show the tradeoff between incentives and income equality", "No society should expect or desire complete equality of income at a given point in time, for a number of reasons.", "First, most workers receive relatively low earnings in their first few jobs, higher earnings as they reach middle age, and then lower earnings after retirement.", "Thus, a society with people of varying ages will have a certain amount of income inequality. Second, people’s preferences and desires differ.", "Some are willing to work long hours to have income for large houses, fast cars and computers, luxury vacations, and the ability to support children and grandchildren.", "These factors all imply that a snapshot of inequality in a given year does not provide an accurate picture of how people’s incomes rise and fall over time.", "Even if we expect some degree of economic inequality at any point in time, how much inequality should there be?", "There is also the difference between income and wealth, as the following Clear It Up feature explains.", "CLEAR IT UP How do you measure wealth versus income inequality?

Although the general idea of a ladder of opportunity for all citizens continues to exert a powerful attraction, specifics are often quite controversial.", "Society can experiment with a wide variety of proposals for building a ladder of opportunity, especially for those who otherwise seem likely to start their lives in a disadvantaged position.", "The government needs to carry out such policy experiments in a spirit of open-mindedness, because some will succeed while others will not show positive results or will cost too much to enact on a widespread basis.", "Inheritance Taxes There is always a debate about inheritance taxes.

It may also be possible to increase equality with little impact on economic output, like the movement from choice D to E. However, at some point, too aggressive a push for equality will tend to reduce economic output, as in the shift from E to F. The tradeoff in Figure 15.10 (b) then flattens out in the area between points D and E, which reflects the pattern that a number of countries that provide similar levels of income to their citizens—the United States, Canada, European Union nations, Japan, and Australia—have different levels of inequality.", "The pattern suggests that countries in this range could choose a greater or a lesser degree of inequality without much impact on economic output.", "Only if these countries push for a much higher level of equality, like at point F, will they experience the diminished incentives that lead to lower levels of economic output.", "In this view, while a danger always exists that an agenda to reduce poverty or inequality can be poorly designed or pushed too far, it is also possible to discover and design policies that improve equality and do not injure incentives for economic output by very much—or even improve such incentives.", "BRING IT HOME Occupy Wall Street The Occupy movement took on a life of its own over the last few months of 2011, bringing to light issues that many people faced on the lower end of the income distribution.", "The contents of this chapter indicate that there is a significant amount of income inequality in the United States.", "The question is: What should be done about it?

President Obama and Congress agreed with the ITC recommendation, and in June 2009 tariffs on Chinese tires increased from 4% to 39%.", "In addition, tariffs on Chinese tires increased further as part of President Trump’s increases on a broad range of Chinese products.", "Why would U.S. consumers buy imported tires from China in the first place? Most likely, because they are cheaper than tires produced domestically or in other countries.", "Therefore, this tariff increase should cause U.S. consumers to pay higher prices for tires, either because Chinese tires are now more expensive, or because U.S. consumers are pushed by the tariff to buy more expensive tires made by U.S. manufacturers or those from other countries.", "In the end, this tariff made U.S. consumers pay more for tires. Was this tariff met with outrage expressed via social media, traditional media, or mass protests?", "Were there “Occupy Wall Street-type” demonstrations? The answer is a resounding “No”.

Conceivably, a tax increase, even a small one, might make voters unhappy.", "However, voters probably realized that it was not worth their time to learn anything about this issue or cast a vote based on it.", "They probably thought their vote would not matter in determining the outcome of an election or changing this policy.", "Estimates of the impact of this tariff show it costs U.S. consumers around $1.11 billion annually. Of this amount, roughly $817 million ends up in the pockets of foreign tire manufacturers other than in China, and the remaining $294 million goes to U.S. tire manufacturers.", "In other words, the tariff increase on Chinese tires may have saved 1,200 jobs in the domestic tire sector, but it cost 3,700 jobs in other sectors, as consumers had to reduce their spending because they were paying more for tires.", "People actually lost their jobs as a result of this tariff.

This theory helps explain why voter turnout is so low in the United States.", "18.2 Special Interest Politics Special interest politics arises when a relatively small group, called a special interest group, each of whose members has a large interest in a political outcome, devotes considerable time and energy to lobbying for the group’s preferred choice.", "Meanwhile, the large majority, each of whose members has only a small interest in this issue, pays no attention.", "We define pork--barrel spending as legislation whose benefits are concentrated on a single district while the costs are spread widely over the country.", "Logrolling refers to a situation in which two or more legislators agree to vote for each other’s legislation, which can then encourage pork-barrel spending in many districts.", "18.3 Flaws in the Democratic System of Government Majority votes can run into difficulties when more than two choices exist.", "A voting cycle occurs when, in a situation with at least three choices, choice A is preferred by a majority vote to choice B, choice B is preferred by a majority vote to choice C, and choice C is preferred by a majority vote to choice A.", "In such a situation, it is impossible to identify what the majority prefers. Another difficulty arises when the vote is so divided that no choice receives a majority.", "A practical approach to microeconomic policy will need to take a realistic view of the specific strengths and weaknesses of markets as well as government, rather than making the easy but wrong assumption that either the market or government is always beneficial or always harmful.", "Self-Check Questions 1.

Trade really occurs because of comparative advantage.", "Recall from the chapter Choice in a World of Scarcity that a country has a comparative advantage when it can produce a good at a lower cost in terms of other goods.", "The question each country or company should be asking when it trades is this: “What do we give up to produce this good?”", "It should be no surprise that the concept of comparative advantage is based on this idea of opportunity cost from Choice in a World of Scarcity.", "For example, if Zambia focuses its resources on producing copper, it cannot use its labor, land and financial resources to produce other goods such as corn.", "As a result, Zambia gives up the opportunity to produce corn. How do we quantify the cost in terms of other goods?", "Simplify the problem and assume that Zambia just needs labor to produce copper and corn.

It was an insult enough that you raised the price on me last month, right in the middle of the biggest recession since the Great Depression, but now instead of a sincere apology, all we get is excuses and a flimsy new name,” wrote one of the over 10,000 who commented on the company blog.", "Customers bailed out almost immediately following the announcement. Netflix's stock price tanked, from $300 a share in mid-July to $78 in late October, and sinking further from there.", "Analysts described it as a “nuclear winter” for Netflix, with many predicting the company’s demise. They also questioned Hastings’ leadership.", "It would require a skillful strategy to pull the company back from the edge. Much depended on the finance team, led by former CFO David Wells, who Hastings later credited with “managing the company's finances during a period of 'dramatic growth.’”", "(Source: CNN Money) Netflix's stock price plummeted in October 2011 following a price hike and an announcement that the company would split up its offerings and rename the DVD rental side.", "The company needed to turn the situation around—and fast. Much of this fell on the finance team. They were well aware that the company would have to navigate the change from Netflix as a DVD rental site to Netflix as a streaming video destination, all the while winning back the trust of its subscribers.", "As Wells and the rest of the finance team knew, the company's key metric was subscribers. Win there, and the rest followed.", "This required that they consider the key factors that would make the journey possible. First, the company needed to show it was listening to its customers.", "Second, they had to reduce risk by moving fast into streaming video ahead of the competition. Third, they needed to turn the company into a creative force in its own right.", "The finance team no doubt knew that with this strategy there would be short-term losses. DVDs had been a profitable business line that had sustained the company since its inception in 1997.", "Sidelining it would make a serious dent. And finally, the company needed a way to make Netflix a viable alternative to its competitors, including the heavyweights of the industry like HBO.", "From a financial perspective, the team saw that removing the legacy part of the business would be the best strategy in the long-term.", "But it was a delicate balancing act to convince subscribers to move towards streaming. Here's what had to happen:", "- The viewing public had to see Netflix in positive terms once again", "- DVD subscribers had to be shifted into a separate business area", "Hastings understood the extent of his blunder, scrapped Qwikster, and issued a humble apology, emphasizing that he was listening to his customers: “I messed up ...", "In hindsight, I slid into arrogance based upon past success,” he wrote on the company blog.", "From there the company pushed forward with essentially the same plan: Customers still had to pay separately for streaming and DVD rental plans.", "Between Q3 and Q4 2011, DVD-by-mail subscriptions dropped 20%, from $13.93M to $11.17M. Meanwhile, streaming-only subscriptions increased slightly, netting just $52M on $476M in sales in Q4.", "For a public company in the spotlight for a bad decision, Netflix was not reassuring investors. But the company wasn’t going to backtrack.", "As Hastings explained on the company blog, if the company didn't take financial hits now, they would have to accept even greater losses in the future.", "“For the past five years, my greatest fear at Netflix has been that we wouldn't make the leap from success in DVDs to success in streaming.", "Most companies that are great at something – like AOL dialup or Borders bookstores – do not become great at new things people want (streaming for us) because they are afraid to hurt their initial business.", "Eventually these companies realize their error of not focusing enough on the new thing, and then the company fights desperately and hopelessly to recover.", "Companies rarely die from moving too fast, and they frequently die from moving too slowly.”", "When the uproar died down, the last of the plan was put in place. The DVD side of the business was separated out in 2012, though given a less 1990s name: DVD.com.", "This cemented the most important element of the financial strategy, which was to remove DVDs from the company’s core offerings.", "It was also a subtle push to get more streaming customers on board.", "Customers, faced with the choice between DVDs and streaming, chose the latter. By the end of 2012, the company’s streaming subscriber numbers surged, adding nearly 10 million globally.", "Meanwhile its losses continued on the DVD side, with around 400,000 dropping out.", "No doubt, the CFO and finance team understood where the market was heading. These losses were no longer a bad sign: in fact, they were a good one.", "Their calculations proved out. Not only did streaming continue to increase, but the company’s profits from streaming began to overtake DVDs.", "This meant its stock price rebounded as analysts and investors realized that the company was on the right track after all.", "There was no more talk of a “nuclear winter.” By October 2013, the stock price reached an all-time high of almost $400 a share.", "(Source: Motley Fool) Netflix's once fat profits from DVDs fell while streaming surged ahead and soon overtook them.", "The team knew that to get out ahead of the competition, it had to be a technology leader. It was one of the to use an algorithm to determine user preferences.", "Then, Netflix began its moonshot into streaming. This meant:", "- Netflix was a first mover among its peers in the streaming video area", "- The finance team proved it was willing to think long-term and support large investments in untried technology", "- CFO David Wells and his team acted in service of their goal of growing subscribers", "In 2007, the company put $40M into developing a video streaming system called Watch Now. This may not seem like a lot for the Netflix of today, but at the time this investment accounted for almost 60% of the year’s profits.", "Not only that, but the technology was in its infancy. Watch Now could only run on Windows Internet Explorer, and users had to download an applet to use it.", "There were also bandwidth problems, as the internet didn’t yet support the speed needed for a seamless video-watching experience.", "Despite all this, it meant Netflix perfected the technology ahead of the competition. The company was also growing its user base while its competitors sat on the sidelines waiting for streaming to be ready for prime time.", "By 2012, all looked rosy. This early bet had proved correct. But in fact, Netflix was about to become a victim of its own success.", "The team knew as early as 2011 that to keep its place at the top of the streaming food chain, Netflix would have to create content of its own.", "- Placing large bets to ensure top quality entertainment", "- Pioneer new ways of delivering content to audiences that would feed their appetite", "- Reinvent the Netflix brand as a TV and movie studio", "Just as the ship seemed to be righting itself, another disaster struck. The partnership with Starz, forged in 2008, abruptly ended in 2012.", "The reason — Netflix was no longer a struggling bit player that could distribute the channel's offerings on the cheap.", "Now, it was a competitor. Starz was owned by Liberty Media, a large cable operator with a number of channels under its control.", "Thousands of movies and TV shows disappeared from Netflix virtually overnight. Customers weren’t happy.", "Meanwhile, the cost and complexity of acquiring titles from Hollywood was becoming unsustainable.", "The company once again had to make a choice. The team had learned that the safest route was to reduce risk by moving faster than the competition.", "They had to reinvent Netflix as a studio in its own right. And they couldn't afford to back into it. They'd have to go big.", "With Netflix Originals, the company pushed forward a bold plan to beat Hollywood at its own game. They would bring in big Hollywood talent and spend millions making shows and movies that were the same caliber as those coming out of the big studios.", "Wells was a key part of this. As he later told audiences at a 2017 Goldman Sachs conference, “I don’t think we have any regrets of the level of content investment we’ve made to date.”", "Rather, he said the amount the company spent would continue to increase as long as “the company can continue to add to its more than 100 million subscribers around the world.”", "In other words, Wells knew that growing subscribers was the goal that mattered most, and if that meant making big investments in creating content, then he was ready to do so.", "The next decision proved that the company’s focus on technology was about to pay off. Netflix chose as its debut program a U.S. remake of a British political drama, “House of Cards.”", "The company spared no expense bringing in top talent to make it, which included director David Fincher (“Fight Club,” “The Social Network”) and actor Kevin Spacey.", "Major networks had passed on the idea because it didn’t seem to have wide appeal. Once again, the team’s investments in R&D were paying off.", "Their smart financial decision to develop a user data tracking algorithm showed that viewers enjoyed the original show.", "Not only that, but they often chose political dramas over other genres, and they liked movies starring Spacey and directed by Fincher.", "Armed with this data, Netflix signed on to make two seasons of “House of Cards,” and then released the first season all at once in February 2013.", "It was a hit. Its stock price rose 97% in the first quarter of 2013 alone. By the end of 2013, Netflix had more than 44 million subscribers and invented a new phenomenon called “binge-watching.”", "Netflix’s competitors are still scrambling to catch up.", "(Source: Statista 2016) Netflix’s dominance of streaming video picked up steam as competitors scrambled to catch up.", "“House of Cards” set a new standard for streaming video programming. The show drew legions of loyal fans.", "It was the first online-only series to receive major nominations at the Primetime Emmys, and won a 2013 Outstanding Director award for David Fincher.", "Lead actress Robin Wright, who portrayed Claire Underwood, was the first to win a Golden Globe for an online-only series.", "As the accolades piled up, Netflix blew out its production side. Its next hit “Orange is the New Black,” debuted in July 2013.", "This was followed by many more binge worthy shows including “Stranger Things,” “Black Mirror,” and “The Crown.”", "Amazon, meanwhile, had Amazon Studios, but it had taken a more cautious approach. It made small budget shows, and distributed them through multiple external studios.", "It wasn’t until the release of “Transparent” in 2015 that Amazon had created a series of the same caliber.", "And it didn’t consolidate its offerings into one destination, Prime Video, until 2017.", "The Netflix story teaches us a great deal about how to successfully navigate tricky waters during a recession.", "The company had to move fast in order to reduce the risk of being outpaced by the competition. This meant expecting and even welcoming losses in the core business.", "It also shows how finance teams touch every aspect of a company. When subscribers were angered by the changes the company made, it was on the CFO to a great extent to drive the initiative forward while facing down a loss of confidence by investors and customers.", "Wells and his team also had to be willing to invest first in R&D and later in entertainment. These expenditures were not for the faint hearted.", "They were risky bets in untried areas with no guarantee of success.", "Ultimately, the story shows that keeping the ultimate goal in mind can clear the way for good decision making.", "Though there were setbacks, it was the combination of the CEO’s vision and the tactical success on the financial front that turned Netflix into the success it is today."]}

I look at a 10 or 20-year price history of the stock, as I need to know, high level, what I’m dealing with.", "The long term character of the stock can give us a lot of insight as to near term expectations. A trending stock trends whereas a range-bound stock undulates between its extremes, etc… These are not hard and fast rules, just general assessments that provide context.", "To be fair, unless someone has been living under a rock for the last decade, they know that Netflix has been on an incredible uptrend.", "So we start there. What does this information provide? It lets us know that we are dealing with a long-established earnings and revenue powerhouse.", "It’s like a measure of reliability or trustworthiness.", "Kam: That makes sense. But then they go and disappoint us in a big way. Does this then destroy some of its long-established credibility?", "Can we trust the future with the confidence we’ve built from the past?", "Himelsein: That is the ultimate question! Generally speaking, yes we can. As I have shared many times before, strength begets strength.", "In particular, the behavior we call “momentum” has one of the most powerful evidentiary backings. A study out of Wharton aptly named “the longest backtest ever done,” looked at 212 years of market data and found that momentum has always been there.", "And it makes sense for two reasons; one, because humans tend to chase, to put it simply, we tend to follow the leaders, in stocks and in life, and two, information takes time to disseminate.", "That is, good news and growing earnings take time to absorb into the market, as people thoughtfully process and act on their decisions.", "All that said, the real issue is identifying when this changes. For no matter how strong the trend or momentum has been, once it changes, it can be over, and sometimes, dramatically.", "So that’s why we go to the next level, getting closer and closer to what’s been happening recently with ever-widening lenses, so as to assess if there’s a crack in the seams.", "Kam: So when you look closer, do you see some cracks in Netflix that you think may change the long term character of this stock?", "Himelsein: As a matter of fact, yes I do. When you look at the most recent year, you actually see behavior that is precisely the opposite of much of the best characteristics I have discussed about many of my picks.", "I am a big fan of recovery strength and have liked many stocks that came roaring out of the Q4 2018 decline with greater vigor than the market.", "I want to see demand in a name that far exceeds the broader market.", "Netflix failed at this and failed miserably. As of before the earnings disappointment a few days ago, it had still not recovered to its October 1st, 2018 level.", "Moreover, it tried to not once, but twice. It crept up to nearly that level as of May 1st but then got taken down with May’s broader market fall.", "This is also bad, it went down with the weight of the market, but did not gain prior with the Q1 push of the market.", "Kam: I had not noticed that, but now that you describe it, I see that you are quite right. So knowing how you think, this would suggest that the long term trend is cracking at the seams?", "Himelsein: Yes, exactly. In general terms, it has spent the entire 2019 in a wide sideways range. The broader S&P 500 has been on fire, as has its more closely connected index, the Nasdaq 100, but Netflix has not.", "It’s lagging on all fronts, demonstrating behavior that is distinctly different from a strong trend leader, aka cracking at the seams.", "And then it cracked. On Thursday of last week, it disappoints on earnings, and gaps down 10%-ish, and sells off even further the very next day to reach about 12.5% off.", "But the concern goes further than that because we are now below the entirety of this year’s sideways movement, breaking even the low that was the first stopping point of its January of 2019 rally (with the market).", "Kam: By your standards of analysis, that seems doubly problematic! Are you, therefore, suggesting that any holder get out now, and no buying the dip at this point?", "Himelsein: High level, Netflix is breaking a powerful long term trend. This can be ugly and can last a while.", "From my perspective, I am therefore not touching Netflix until I see a healthy stop to the pain and healthy recovery.", "That said, and to be fair, Netflix may be fine in the long run. Based on my assessment, Netflix could be out of favor for months, or perhaps the rest of the year or even longer.", "The point is that how long it is “out of favor” and the related deterioration period is a complete unknown.", "It is reasonable to be a fan of the long term viability of the business model and believe that it will revert to its historic trend at some point.", "If investors can live with gyrations and have no need for liquidity, there is nothing wrong with holding the stock until it turns around.", "But that’s not what I do. I would rather find better places to deploy that capital. I have learned from decades of investing that what matters is tomorrow.", "We can only pay our bills with money in the bank, not with gains from next year’s turn around.", "My Take: Wayne has an 18+ year track record delivering 11.79% a year while the S&P 500 returned just 5.93% for the same period.", "Few managers have outperformed the market for as long and by as wide a margin.", "If you are thinking about selling Netflix and want some ideas about where to invest the proceeds, click here to learn more about Wayne, the stocks he has been buying recently, and sign up to be notified when he updates his views."]}

Obviously, it was Netflix.", "I’ll let you know why.. (And I’m under no illusions that I’ll actually have one of these questions asked.)", "Normally, if you asked me if earnings calls matter, I’d say no. Sure, the letter to shareholders will have some data, and the quarterly reports matter to investors, but the presentation is the most self-interested presentation imaginable.", "It would be like listening to just the closing statement of the prosecution in a trial. You’d get a lot more guilty verdicts, don’t you think?", "But I have a much larger project I hope to unveil sometime this year where I make a “power ranking” of streaming/bundling services.", "From ad-supported to sports, anything digital video I will rank in one definitive list. Like sports power rankings, if you go to ESPN or any sports website nowadays.", "To build that ranking requires good information, like all good decisions. And right now the company that has the most black holes in data, for me, is Netflix.", "Since I’ve written about their data and even coined a phrase about how selectively they pull it (read here for “datecdotes”), I naturally had the most questions for Netflix, and they convinced me to finally write an email.", "To be fair—meaning unbiased across all digital video companies—I hope to roll out this type of feature semi-regularly with other digital video companies.", "Google, Apple and Disney are the most relevant, though Disney gets a brief reprieve with all the information they dropped on us last week.", "Youtube deserves a ton of questions and so does Apple with their paucity of information.", "With that preamble, onto the questions. I have three big areas: Viewership (to see how valuable their content is), activity (to gauge how subscribers interact with the site) and subscribers (to probe their business model a bit).", "After each question, I’ll explain my reasoning in parentheses. These explanations I didn’t send!", "– In the last earnings call, Netflix reported that Bird Box was viewed by 80 million customers over the first four weeks.", "During that time, was it the most viewed movie on your platform? Over 2019 as a whole, was it the most viewed movie on your platform?", "Have any Star Wars, Marvel or Disney Animated films had more viewers than Bird Box since their respective launches?", "(As we look to the battlefield of 2020, churn is the name of the game. Is the most popular content on Netflix leaving?", "I believe it is with either Friends (or other long running TV shows like it) or all the Disney content.", "This question helps get at that for the movies side, especially the Disney content.)", "– In the Q3 earnings call of last year, you said that 80 million unique customer accounts had watched one or more “Summer of Love” romantic comedies on your site, was that using the same standard as Bird Box, where you counted “watched” as 70% completion of a film?", "(If Netflix answers this, I’d be shocked. My guess is they moved to the 70% threshold after minor pushback on their Q3 report.", "They knew they had to explain the calculation, but waited for a film that did well enough, like Bird Box, to justify it.", "Still, if they say, “No”, then that “Summer of Love” number can be severely discounted. Likely they won’t ever answer either way.)", "– How many people watched The Christmas Chronicles? Or The Ballad of Buster Scruggs or Private Life? How many hours have customers viewed for any of this content?", "(You reported in the last earnings call that you do track hours viewed on site.)", "(Again, this is to help flesh out the context of whatever numbers they do release. And the scale of losses.", "This is the best example of how one-sided an earnings report is. If there were a “defendant” making the bear case, these are the numbers their defense lawyers would seize on to make their case, to continue the prosecutor announcement from earlier.)", "– In 2018, what was your monthly active users? What has been your monthly active users in 2019?", "(Monthly active users is the metrics that “feels” right for me when it comes to truly understanding the people who love your service.", "I don’t have data, but my gut that it explains usage best. Monthly users are the people who devoured some piece of your content in their entertainment diet.", "Subscribers is not that. If I were “entertainment czar” all streamers would have to release this.)", "– You reported the service “averages” 100 million hours a day of viewing in the US in a month. How much does that average vary by month?", "What does the time on site distribution look like by customer decile? What was the annual daily average?", "(We all hate averages, don’t we? Well I do. They don’t tell use anything. And since someone quoted the “2 hours per day” number to me for Netflix usage recently, it made me want to know a lot more about it.", "Also, related to this is the variance overtime. December happens to be a huge month for Netflix, so touting numbers from December is deliberately overselling the annual performance.)", "– In your Q4 report, you mentioned a net add of 29 million customer accounts. What was the number of gross adds versus net?", "How does this breakdown internationally versus US? You used to report gross adds in 2011, why did you move away from this metric?", "(I didn’t know Netflix used to report this, and this is the type of number they should report, if you follow the standard, “Does the CEO get this information?”", "Because Reed Hastings definitely does. [I love that standard, by the way.] Again, churn is the name of the game, and the great thing about Netflix’s 60 million or subscribers is that it grows steadily every year.", "Which gives an illusion of stability the gross number would help understand. International is even more curious for me.)", "– What is the total unique subscriber base you have had in the US since you launched streaming?", "(My final way to get at the churn questions. Say Netflix had had 140 million unique subscribers in the US since launching in 2008.", "Some of those are duplicate accounts—people who signed up, then switched—surely. But some aren’t. That gets to the idea that it isn’t like Netflix is convincing people to try Netflix for the first time, but to come back.", "Which is fascinating, to me, and a different business challenge.)"]}

So the upper bound, if it was natural for each family member to have a separate subscription, like you each have a separate Facebook account, if it becomes so personalized video that you do want it individualized, than that would be the upper bound.", "Another way of looking at the market is the number of households that can subscribe to cable or satellite, and that number is about 100 million.", "BI: Do you think that you ultimately will start offering personalized accounts? That’s an interesting idea that I hadn’t heard before.", "RH: It’s quite personalized now, but not in a way that’s so compelling that you never want to say “I don’t want to use my kid’s account.”", "The question is, over time, can we make Netflix so personalized that as the kids get to be teenagers and they get their own Facebook account and their own mobile phone, that they also get their own Netflix account?", "BI: So, as you think about it, do you think the 100 million number is the right market-opportunity number that people should think about, or should it be a 200-300 million type number?", "RH: Well 100 million is another upper bound, and that assumes, in this case, that every single cable or satellite household subscribes to Netflix, so both of those are available market figures.", "As to how they get split between Netflix and its competitors, that’s really hard to tell. Somewhere north of 20 million, south of 300 million.", "BI: What percentage of the 20 million now have cancelled cable or other TV?", "RH: Everyone, essentially, on Netflix has a TV service and also 30% of them have HBO, which is the national average.", "BI: So right now, it’s definitely not an either/or, in fact it’s just how many more services can you pile on top of your existing cable service?", "RH: Yes, that’s right. We’re like one more cable network. We’ve grown from in the last three years, the number of streaming accounts in the US from zero to 20 million, and MVPD (multi-channel video programming distributor) is basically steady, so last year, total MVPD in the US went down slightly, or the first three quarters of the year, but that was largely due to the recession.", "And then in Q4, total MVPD households went back up. And if Netflix were a substitute, you would see MVPD going down like landlines have, or something like that, which you don’t see.", "BI: We already talked about one possible way that you could get more money per household, which is personalized accounts.", "Do you think that with streaming, you will ultimately have tiers, the same way that you do with DVDs.", "Like I get a basic selection for $8, but if I pay $15 I get twice as much stuff, or I get cooler, different stuff.", "RH: We don’t have any plans for that. We want to focus on a simple proposition: unlimited streaming for $7.99 per month.", "Our big focus is taking that simple proposition around the globe. We started with Canada seven months ago, we’ve been super successful there, we’re targeting to surpass 1 million subscribers this summer.", "Less than one year from launch in Canada. That’s been so successful that we’re now expanding to other countries.", "RH: All the markets where people have broadband and like TV.", "BI: Switching gears, let's talk about content deals going forward. I know Time Warner CEO Jeff Bewkes was quoted recently as saying something like “Look, back when Starz did their huge deal with Netflix, they were asleep at the switch, it was just a test, and suddenly, everyone has now woken up.", "There’s no way anyone would ever cut a deal like that again.” Do you think that’s true?", "RH: When we did the Starz deal in 2008, we almost walked away from it because it was so much money for an activity that basically didn’t happen, i.e. streaming, at the time.", "Now, as we look at renewal coming up the middle of Q1 next year, we will clearly pay more. And there are more people streaming, so we can afford to pay more.", "BI: Do you think you’ll pay the same way? As I understand it, the last deal was basically a flat fee--will the next deal be a per-sub fee, or is it likely to be per-stream?", "How do you think the content deals of the future like that will be structured?", "RH: I’m not really sure. We’re looking about how to acquire content. Traditionally or generally, most of our content, they want a guarantee, and a flat rate.", "BI: They want that even with you going from however many single-digit million subscribers you had when you started the Starz deal to now, with 20 million subscribers, even going forward you think they’ll want that, or will they want an average fee per sub or per stream?", "RH: Many of our deals are shorter term, 1-2 year deals, so it’s fixed in the short term, but fundamentally it’s variable in the long term.", "BI: You’ve said you ultimately hope to be the biggest revenue source for a lot of the content providers.", "The objection that I hear raised to that very quickly is “Oh come on, look how much the cable companies pay, that’s why the bills are $160 per month, Netflix is $8, how could that possibly be?”", "RH: For some content owners like Relativity Media, where we did an output deal with them, we’re already their biggest customer.", "So it depends on the content, in terms of the big bill that you referred to. There’s a huge amount of sports content, a majority of the value of MVPD.", "And then of course there’s news and reality and lots of other content types that we don’t focus on.", "BI: Do you think you ever will offer news and reality and other types of content? I know I read a presentation a couple of years ago from you saying “No, we’ve picked our market, we’re going to focus on that market.”", "I know a lot of subscribers hope that you’ll go into sports and things like that. Is that possible?", "RH: Now we’re very focused on TV shows and movies, and there’s an enormous opportunity. If you look at our selection, it’s really good.", "But it’s still a small part of the total universe of TV shows and movies. So both on the subscriber view and on the content view, we have tons of room to expand within TV shows and movies.", "BI: On the selection issue, certainly with our family, what often happens is that we’ll start talking about watching a particular movie, everyone gets all excited, and the kids will say “Oh it’ll be on Netflix.\"", "Then they’ll go check and find out that it’s there via DVD, which is great, but suddenly it seems like Pony Express to wait for the DVD, and it’s often not there on streaming.", "How long will it take before most of the stuff that we’re all looking for is just going to be there, and it becomes relatively rare that you don’t have something available for streaming?", "RH: Really, it is there today, from iTunes or Amazon, it’s just that you have to pay-per-view. So the newer stuff is first available in pay-per-view, and both of the services, iTunes and Amazon, are pretty comprehensive, but you’ve got to pay each time.", "RH: Very, very unlikely. We’re focused on the subscription. Unlimited for a flat fee. That simple proposition.", "So the same answer I gave you about simple possibilities with tiering.", "BI: Do you see Apple getting into a subscription thing at any point? There have been talks that they are, in theory, doing that, but we haven’t seen it yet.", "RH: You’d have to ask them. Amazon is in subscription as you know with Prime, Hulu Plus is in subscription, and there may be others over time.", "BI: But, really, why wouldn’t you offer pay-per-view? You now have this incredible catalog where you can find any movie and it’s either available by DVD or streaming--would it really muddy the waters that much to have a pay-per-view option?", "RH: It’s a little like Business Insider doing sports news or something.", "RH: If you do sports news, you'd find that some of your readers really enjoy it, because you have a unique take on it, but that mostly it’s such a big competitive market that you really have to make your brand stand for something very specific.", "At least until you’re the size of the Wall Street Journal. And for us, it’s about brand clarity, and that we stand for $7.99 per month for unlimited streaming.", "That’s what we really want to focus on and we think that’s the optimal strategy. Rather than try to get into every possible thing that our subscribers also want, like should we sell DVDs?", "BI: You guys are on a tremendous number of devices ranging from video game consoles to connected TVs and all that.", "Have you noticed anything unusual or interesting about the way people are consuming streaming content across any of these devices?", "RH: It’s really quite broad. We get great traction on internet TVs, on Blu-ray players, on game consoles, iPads, Apple TV, iPhone.", "It’s amazing really how broad the viewing of our content is.", "BI: Do you have any interest in the complementary social aspects that a lot of startups are focusing on?", "Getting people communicating on a second screen or even the first screen while they’re watching a show, or is Netflix kind of a private experience?", "RH: We’re open to adapting our service as new enjoyment paradigms rise (such as multi-person viewing), so there’s social thing for finding content you want to watch, like these six other people you know just watched X, and then there’s social thing during the watching which is a little trickier with online because it’s asynchronous.", "Everyone watches at a different time. But, just as social transforms the internet generally, it will also transform the Netflix experience.", "BI: So you just had to offer a higher compression streaming option in Canada because of bandwidth caps and overage charges, and I saw you talk quite a bit about this during the last earnings presentation.", "Do you think this is going to be a problem here in the states where we’re going to have to think about keeping an eye on the bandwidth meter, and do you foresee yourself having to adjust your service here to meet that?", "RH: Well in ways we already have caps. If you look at most of the iPad mobile plans, they’re 2 GB, and then $10 per GB after that.", "AT&T just implemented an 150 GB cap on DSL, 250 GB on U-Verse fiber. So that’s clearly a move by some ISPs at least, and hopefully other ISPs will compete against them on the basis of being unlimited.", "RH: With Google’s Kansas City move, hopefully that’s a sign of a long-term future trend that most of America gets Gigabit Ethernet, or Internet, and that these kind of skirmishes around 50 gigs, 100 gigs, 200 gigs are perceived to be like the 640K PC barrier 30 years ago.", "BI: There seem to be people who think that MSOs [cable operators] and Telcos will try to stifle competition from people like you by imposing really small caps and high overage fees.", "Is that plausible or do you think that’s a worry that people shouldn’t have?", "RH: No that’s plausible. In Canada, right after we announced that we were entering Canada, a few days after, Rogers lowered the caps on their most popular plans.", "So those kinds of things can definitely happen and then it’s an ongoing tension. We can do those high-density encodes like you referred to, and hopefully over time, broad, fast, inexpensive Internet becomes more and more a part of every person’s life, and that will open the possibility again over five or ten years for more online video.", "BI: That's a good segue into competition. This market is just incredibly noisy and there’s so much competition, you’ve got TV everywhere and you’ve got pay-per-view stuff, you’ve got Amazon now linking streaming to Prime, you’ve got Facebook suddenly doing a deal with Warner, Google TV, so forth.", "RH: In the beginnings of a new market, it’s really hard to figure out who the long-term competition is, and what we tend to focus on is how to grow our business, and we’ll see what competition emerges.", "In general, the big incumbents, like the MVPDs, they may turn out to be the biggest competition with TV everywhere.", "But it depends on what their goals are and how they execute, and in particular, the more consumers see us as truly complementary, to MVPDs, then the less incentive they are to try to stop us or kill us.", "BI: What percentage of the 100 million households that have cable and satellite do you think can actually afford a complementary service on top of the cable service?", "RH: Your typical cable bill is, what, $70-$80? If you ask how many could afford $7.99, it’s probably pretty high, right?", "BI: What do you think is the likely future of cable? A lot of people are saying “Look, there’s certainly a business for cable.", "Somebody’s got to be the actual hook-up to the Internet, but the idea that somebody else is going to have a box and control all the content is just ludicrous, and ultimately they [cable providers] will be reduced to being big fat pipes.", "RH: No, that’s too pessimistic. They certainly will have a broadband business, which has very high profitability because it doesn’t have content costs.", "They’ll have a telephony business, and many, many more people get telephony from their cable company than they do from Vonage or Skype.", "Third, they’ll have a video business and they’ll offer unique content bundles, unique other things. I mean look at DirecTV—it’s growing substantially because it’s got incredible NFL content.", "BI: On that subject--the sports question--are there folks who will do what Netflix has done in sports and become a very viable alternative option?", "RH: Well there’s MLB TV which runs direct to consumer subscriptions today. So that would be a place to start, and then whether NFL and other leagues do the same I’m not sure.", "Certainly MLB is doing that to a degree today, and I think they try to keep it somewhat complementary.", "BI: Lastly, I have a couple questions about Netflix’s culture. I was fascinated by the presentation you did about that a couple of years ago.", "For example, the fact that you have no set vacation policy company-wide--that folks can take as much vacation as they want.", "When I broached that idea here asking if it was a good idea and if we should do that, people freaked out because they said “No, what’ll happen is everyone will work around the clock and I will feel like I can never take a vacation.”", "RH: I would say we don’t have a “no vacation” policy, that’s a little ambiguous. Instead, we have no policy on vacation.", "Perhaps because I take lots of great vacations it sets a good example. If you [Henry] were more visibly on vacation and then when you asked the question about it, everyone would probably relax.", "To the degree that you hardly ever are seen to take vacation, that might scare people.", "BI: And the other thing you said that jumped out was “We’re not a family, we’re a professional sports team.", "Therefore, we’re going to try to have the best players at every position, and that means that folks who are B-players are going to be working elsewhere.”", "And when I raised that as a possibility here, people said “It’s ridiculous. There are lots of players who are B’s who want to be A’s.", "It’s just much too harsh.” What’s your reaction to that?", "RH: You’re over-simplifying with A’s and B’s. There’s a lot of graduations in terms of how someone performs.", "We’ve often had someone who was performing OK at one job so we move them to another job and they do fantastic.", "So it’s not even that much a reflection on the person. But in general, a sports-oriented model is “If you want to win the championships, you have to have great players who can work together.”", "You need both of those, and so that’s what we focus on: getting great people who can work together.", "BI: How do you convey to somebody that they’re just not quite great enough?", "RH: An employee who doesn’t work out usually knows it and the parting is mutual. Most admit they thought it would be for them and ignored signs that it wouldn’t.", "For example, we hire a lot of seasoned people but we don’t have all the perks – cubes, not offices, very few assistants, small staffs, no traditional HR support (plan your own offsite!).", "Some find that refreshing, others learn quickly that they’re accustomed to all the trappings and aren’t comfortable without them.", "It’s an honest and candid environment, and as a result, most employees who don’t work out say thank you when they leave.", "BI: Is there anything else that you think is critical to Netflix’s culture that has helped you become such an incredibly successful company over the past ten years?", "RH: It’s like the classic example: Which of the innovations for the DC-10 were most important? The retractable flaps and retractable wings, they all went together, and it’s pretty hard to put a finger on it.", "Some of the things are symbols -- the vacation policy symbolizes freedom and responsibility. But you couldn’t really do freedom and responsibility without high performance.", "And so those are intimately linked. And you couldn’t do freedom and responsibility without our kind of context management model.", "RH: In our culture deck, there’s a chapter on “context, not control,” which is using your role as manager and leader to educate people and what we’re trying to do and not guiding each specific action a person takes.", "When someone working for you does something that you think is a bad choice, instead of blaming them, it’s reflecting on yourself in terms of what context you failed to provide.", "Such as finding a talented person, who would come to the right decision. So it’s always reflecting back on the manager--what context did I fail to set?", "RH: The values are really key, that not only should one be clear about one’s values, but that there’s a collective intolerance to bad behavior.", "BI: Last thing… you wrote an extraordinary public letter to Whitney Tilson, who had publicly shorted your stock.", "When CEOs do that it’s usually a huge red flag and everybody in the world says “The company is screwed--I can pile on now.”", "Obviously you phrased the letter in a way that wasn’t like that at all. You went point by point. Yet, in the middle of it, you say that there are some things that Whitney was right to be concerned about.", "So what else should people actually be worried about?", "RH: I’d refer you to our January earnings letter where we said the two core questions are: “Given our approach, how big will we get in the domestic market?” and second, “How successful will we be internationally?”", "BI: You never did actually answer the first question we asked about how big you’ll get domestically. How big will you get domestically?", "RH: That’s exactly why there are investors who debate that. It doesn’t really matter what I think. It matters what actually happens.", "BI: I know it doesn’t matter, but I’m interested. How big do you think you’ll get?", "RH: There’s no simple way to tell it. We’re growing very well right now, and we’re focused on making our service better and better.", "But other than those benchmarks that I gave you, and then the question is “Well, what’s the appropriate discount to apply to those?”", "That’s where the investor judgment comes in. And then once an investor answers those questions for themselves, then they can figure out if they want to be a buyer of our stock at the current price.", "BI: And what about the international question? Are there unique challenges in many of the other attractive markets where there is broadband and people that want to watch TV that will prevent you from being successful?", "RH: Yes--in certain markets, in China in particular, it looks very daunting for US companies to build a profitable business.", "Now read the presentation on \"Culture\" that Reed refers to above >", "Thanks to Business Insider's Ellis Hamburger for transcribing the call."]}

By finally getting control of losses (holding steady at $3 billion) Wall Street will likely stay on the Netflix bandwagon.", "If losses had increased to $4 billion, would investors have the same patience?

Consider this the analysis of the data set before us, and it applies to everyone, including people at the company.", "First, this is a classic “small sample size” problem.", "Frankly, Netflix doesn’t have as a large of a sample size for their economists to leverage as I made it appear above.", "Sure, each year gives you a quarterly subscriber number. So 2008-2018 is 11 years by 4 quarters, or a sample size of 44.", "Except, the initial growth really isn’t representative. They transitioned a lot of people over from DVDs.", "We could look at monthly data, which would multiply it by 12, but that’s probably too granular for how often Netflix changes prices.", "If we just went by price changes we are at a sample size below ten. So no matter what model you build, you won’t have a lot of data to leverage.", "Second, there are multiple variables to consider, in addition to price.", "The problem with those fancy models is they may not have priced in the value of all that content correctly.", "If the model makes the assumption, “We can replace Disney/Warner streaming content with originals” and it turns out their originals aren’t popular with people (though still popular with critics), then the double whammy of price increases and content loss could lead to a drop out.", "Moreover, new services are entering that will compete for share of wallet. All these factors should work together to make us very uncertain here.", "So for everyone—myself included—who is willing to make a prediction: don’t! Or do so with a huge grain of salt.", "Your “90% confidence interval”—hat tip to Kahneman, Tversky, and OB professors everywhere—should be really large.", "Again, if the goal is to make a prediction that is right 9 times out of ten, then make the range very large.", "I have two. First, many of the people debating this on Twitter will not actually make a quantified prediction.", "They will say something like, “This price increase will not materially effect Netflix’s subscriber growth.”", "With a prediction like that, nothing is quantified. Even if they are wrong, how could I prove it? There is so much wiggle room they could easily debate the facts.", "Still, I think we’re smarter when we at least try to quantify our predictions. It forces us to think through the issues.", "So as foolish as it may be, I’m going to make a prediction. For the upper range, Netflix saw a real world subscriber increase of 11% in 2018.", "It was 10% the year before that, so I’m making 10% my upper interval on my prediction. In other words, I see a best case scenario where the price increase doesn’t hurt subscriber growth.", "For the floor, this is tougher. And this is where I worry about being too confident in my prediction.", "Again, it is very, very hard to be right 90% of the time. We’re often too over-confident. So I can see an upper growth of 10%, but if the price increase back fires, along with all the content leaving, I could see a scenario where Netflix loses 10% of their customer base.", "Yikes, that sounds high, but again I want to be right 9 times out of 10 here. Here’s a table with potential % drop out rates to judge for yourself:", "Now to the prediction itself. Assuming a 80% MAU rate (on the high end of my range), with a 10% “willing to drop out” gives me 2% growth.", "That sounds right and gets me right to about 60 million customers. So there you have that prediction.", "Prediction: 2% growth in subscribers, up to 60 million customers at the end of 2019.", "90% Confidence Interval: 52.6-64.3 million customers in the end of 2019. (That’s subscriber decreases of -10% to 10% growth.)"]}

So I took a swing at answering at a REALLY high level.", "“Netflix just reported that they have 125 million global subscribers. If they can double that over the next ten years, and they can also double what they charge, they will have 250 million subs paying $20 per month.", "Which is (pause for jet-lagged mental calculation) $5 billion in revenues. Each month. Or $60 billion per year.”", "There was a slightly stunned silence in the room. I’ll explain why in a minute, but I want to point out that I am not making an actual prediction on Netflix here.", "This is just kind of ‘back of the napkin’ thinking about what the media industry might look like ten years from now.", "I find this a useful exercise for a lot of strategy stuff.", "According to the Netflix results for Q1 2018, total global subs were 125.00 million, although only 118.90 million are paying customers, with the balance on the free month trial.", "The company is adding about 7.5 million subscribers per quarter at this time (8.33 million in Q4/17, 7.41 million in Q1/18, and is forecasting 6.20 million for Q2/18, although they have been beating their forecasts most quarters.)", "Most of those are converting to paying subscribers in the following quarter.", "Therefore Netflix is at a run rate of adding about 30 million subs per year. At that rate, they would have about 425 million paying subs by 2028, not 250 million.", "My assumption is intentionally conservative. Possibly MUCH too conservative, but I’ll stick with it for now.", "In the quarter, the company had $3.602 billion in streaming revenues from 118.90 million paying subscribers, so quarterly revenues of $30.29 per sub per quarter, or $10.10 monthly.", "In the US, they have raised prices 12% over the last year, with no slowdown in growth or customers quitting over the increase.", "Internationally, ignoring currency swings, monthly revenues per subscriber increased 13%.", "At a rate of 12-13% annual price increases, Netflix would cost more than $32 per month by 2028. That feels too high, so I will stick with my assumption above, that they double the monthly price over the next decade to about $20, which equates to an annual increase of 7.1% compounded.", "In some ways it doesn’t. If Netflix reaches 250 million subs in 2028, that is a lot more than today…but still small compared to traditional TV viewers worldwide, which were about 1.6 billion TV households globally in 2016, projected to grow to 1.68B by 2021, so likely 1.8B by 2028.", "The amount of time each subscriber spends watching Netflix seems to have plateaued or is even declining.", "Global TV revenues are around $380 billion in 2018 ($200B in pay TV revenues and $180B in advertising) so although a hypothetical 2028 Netflix top line of $60B is big for a single company, it is still small in the context of the overall industry.", "Although TV revenues globally are not growing as fast as Netflix, neither are they shrinking: estimates for the industry worldwide in 2021 suggest it will be roughly flat, or even up slightly, and I assume about the same for 2028.", "Whether we look at subscribers, time spent, or even dollars, there seems to be ample room for Netflix to coexist with the traditional TV industry.", "Netflix will spend about $8 billion on content in 2018. Compared to 2017 revenues of $11.243 billion, that seems really high: no media company can spend over 70% of revenues on content!", "As a comparison, Time Warner also spends about $8B on non-sports content, but has revenues of over $30B.", "“Netflix sure spends a lot. It is driving up the price of content for all of us. Thank God they can’t spend any more than they already do.", "Without getting into an actual forecast of what current year revenues will be (that comes too close to the kind of company-specific opining I won’t do), my napkin math suggests that they could have 2028 revenues of $60B or so.", "I don’t think they will be spending 70% of those conjectured revenues on content. But 50% is plausible.", "That Netflix is close to some sort of “ceiling” on content spending at $8 billion per year looks unsupportable in this scenario.", "I don’t see spending growing unreasonably, but could they be spending over $30 billion by 2028?", "Yes. And that is about as much as NBCU, Fox, Time Warner and Disney spent on non-sports content last year.", "As always, some disclosures. None of the numbers above are official from my day job. This isn’t a prediction, merely a thought exercise to answer the question of “where does Netflix go from here?”", "Most importantly, although I am a former portfolio manager, none of this should be used as investment advice, or constitutes an opinion of NFLX share price or valuation.", "That isn’t just boilerplate disclaimer: the stock is already highly valued, and I literally have NO OPINION at all on whether the price goes up or down.", "Neither I nor my wife owns any shares or interest in NFLX.", "People-led transformation for enterprises of all sizes. #productivity #resilience #sustainability", "6yI think as more screens are added per person, the uptake could surge in coming years. They have the killer tech plus content advantage that's unstoppable right now.", "So if I start consuming stuff I like on different screens at different time, they could expect a rise of 25% on charges over the next few years.", "It depends on the speed with which they can produce more niche content for the hundreds of personas they know they cater right now.", "Just wondering if smart distribution of content is an interesting play in the markets they are excelling right now, meaning are there indicators of creating content for more screen types (and bite size)?", "6yThis kind of projective thinking is important and useful. I'd argue that your upper subscriber figures are a stretch - as Netflix demonstrates the potential of the market, it will face more competition and more difficulty in gaining additional subscribers - but your more conservative estimate could be reasonable.", "I guess what Netflix is really doing is making content global and benefiting from those economies of scale.", "Netflix makes a show, and can then show it in every single market for no additional cost. Compare that to a Showtime, for example, which has immediate access to US subscribers, but then has to act through local distributors (Sky, Star, etc) to reach a wider audience, with a commensurate loss in revenue.", "What it hasn't shown is that it can marshall that revenue well. On $11.6bn of revenue last year, it turned a profit of $200m - it's a start, but it needs to become much better at being a business, not just a content factory."]}

A month later, Netflix removed support for the popular app, AirPlay.", "They cited Apple support’s for new devices (Samsung, LG, and Sony will start working with AirPlay in 2019) as the cause (explaining that they would not be able to provide the proper level of support).", "Despite the ban by the App Store editors, Netflix still ranks #1 in the Entertainment category. However, without regular mentions in Featuring, the application has lost its position in both Top Grossing and Free.", "In short, yes.

In January 2019, the first month after canceling payments through the App Store, Netflix shares on the New York NASDAQ rose 22% from $276 to $337.", "Does this mean investors saw greater value in Netflix?", "1) These values are less than the historical maximum in July 2018, when the price reached $418. Therefore, this is not about continuing growth, but the fluctuation of the stock price within the local interval.", "2) In December, the fall of the stock price (which continued from a peak in July) stopped.

This is less than the growth for Q4 2018, which was 27%.", "The growth rate fell by 5 percentage points for the quarter. Could this be at least partly caused by the conflict with Apple?", "At the beginning of 2018, quarterly growth was at 40% and then slowed down to 27%, (that is, about a third).", "It is more logical to attribute this slowdown to the saturation of the market and the exhaustion of light growth opportunities.", "Fortunately for us, Netflix provides an opportunity to look deeper at the statistics of the number of paid subscribers in its reporting, including a breakdown of the US / the rest of the world.", "In the local market in 2018, the number of Netflix paid subscribers increased by 10.7%, from $53 to $58.5 million; and for the 1st quarter of 2019 another 3% increase to $ 60.2M, which in annual terms is 12%.", "Compared with 2018, the growth of the 1st quarter of 2019 was higher!", "And what about the average bill? Did Netflix lower prices in order to remain competitive without the support of Apple?", "But everything is under control: even by the most modest estimates, the average bill rose by at least 10 cents to $11.5 (Netflix has not yet disclosed the exact data, but the numbers are expected to be higher).", "According to the tariff, this average bill means that the average paid subscriber in the USA watches video on 4 screens at the same time, which is suitable for the average family.", "With a population of approximately 330M and about 128M households, we can estimate that half of American households use Netflix.", "Of course, the other half still remains for an opportunity for growth, but, most likely, the easiest opportunities for growth have already been exhausted.", "Looking at not only the continuation of growth but also its acceleration in Q1 2019 we can see that Netflix’s conflict with the AppStore didn’t have much impact on performance.", "In the 2018 international market, paid subscriptions increased by 40%, from ~ $58 M to $81M, and in Q1 2019 to $88.6M, which is + 10% for the quarter and + 40% in annual terms!", "Thus, in general, the impact of the fight with Apple wasn’t much at all and Netflix saved on commission fees.", "It is worth noting that Netflix itself is optimistic about the future. The revenue growth forecast for Q2 2019 is estimated at 26%, 4 percentage points more than growth in Q1 2019.", "If the forecast comes true, we can assume that for the service as a whole, growth will continue at just as fast pace as before.", "While Apple and Netflix tried to sort this out, the latter became a frequent guest in the Google Play collections: the number of references to the service has increased 10 times since January 2019.", "But Apple, in the absence of Netflix, has found new favorites to feature. Since the beginning of 2019, VSCO and Fortnite have become the most mentioned apps.", "Apple is also preparing to launch Apple TV Plus, and the application page has already been optimized in the App Store.", "This article was originally published on Hacker Noon."]}

Consequently, minor changes to cash flows, WACC or long-term growth will have a dramatic effect on the calculated value.", "Perhaps a better way would be to use Enterprise Value/Revenues, which was 10.8x (FY’2018) and 8x on a forward basis.", "Both are high but nothing out of the ballpark.

Foreign firms often think that what helped them be successful in the US or in other foreign markets will also help them be successful in China.", "I think Uber China is a perfect example for that (see my blog post \"China Musings #8\"). The list of foreign firms that failed in China grows by the day, so the few ones that enter and succeed in China, deserve a closer look.", "Apple is one of such companies. Apple is a popular brand in China, and their growth story here has been remarkable.", "Yet with a market that is changing so rapidly, even a company like Apple will inevitable run into issues.", "After talking to China observers, reading articles, and doing some more research on my own, I wanted to share some observations on where Apple is headed in China.", "Apple recently issued a revenue warning. Certainly not the first one (last such warning was in 2002) and also not the first time that there were issues with iPhone sales (there were issues around the iPhone 5 and 6S cycles), but this one was different given the role that Greater China played – especially with regards to iPhone sales.", "While we anticipated some challenges in key emerging markets, we did not foresee the magnitude of the economic deceleration, particularly in Greater China.", "In fact, most of our revenue shortfall to our guidance, and over 100 percent of our year-over-year worldwide revenue decline, occurred in Greater China across iPhone, Mac and iPad…", "Lower than anticipated iPhone revenue, primarily in Greater China, accounts for all of our revenue shortfall to our guidance and for much more than our entire year-over-year revenue decline.", "In fact, categories outside of iPhone (Services, Mac, iPad, Wearables/Home/Accessories) combined to grow almost 19 percent year-over-year.", "This, however, isn’t the first time when Apple started having issues in China with regards to iPhone sales.", "Back in 2017 the company’s reports indicated that Greater China might be an issue for Apple going forward (all regions were up, except for China).", "Apple’s advantage around the world has always been the approach of “hardware differentiated by software.”", "This allowed Apple to sell the hardware with a margin much greater than competitors who run a commodity operating system.", "That “software differentiation” is not just because of the operating system being subjectively “better,” but also because an operating system can function as a “lock-in” once someone starts using it.", "If you want iOS, Apple has a “monopoly” on it. I’m a good example for that. What I value most is the camera, but by now there are plenty of competitors with better cameras, and I still haven’t switched away.", "In China, Apple has an additional advantage which is the country’s inequality and the very strong consumer aspirations.", "Apple products, especially the iPhone, remain highly popular. It’s something that someone would put on the table to show others they can afford it.", "I would argue that in China it’s mostly Apple’s brand that is the main selling point. Yet while the brand factor matters a lot, it’s not the only thing that matters in China.", "Unlike the rest of the world, in China, the most important layer of the smartphone stack is not the phone’s phone’s operating system.", "But it’s actually an App, namely WeChat with over a billion DAUs. There is no aspects of Chinese life that is not conducted through that single apple: messaging, mobile payment, video calls, hailing a cab, social media, investing money, buying cinema/flight/rail tickets, switching insurance provider, games, accessing government resources, etc.", "Looking outside of China, you won’t find anything comparable. For lack of better words, WeChat becomes your phone.", "And considering how much of daily life is managed through one’s phone in China, WeChat becomes super powerful.", "Naturally, WeChat works the same on iOS as it does on Android. Which consequently means that for the average Apple user, the switching cost away fro the iPhone is fairly low.", "This shows in the retention rate of iPhone users which is about 50% for iPhone (back in 2016) compared to 80% in other markets.", "In most parts of the world it’s hard to imagine seeing an iPhone user upgrade to anything but another iPhone.", "It would mean a loss of user experience, too many apps to back-up/transfer/reinstall, or specifically for the US, too many contacts on iMessage to even entertain the idea of a device switch.", "It’s a whole different picture in China, where life is centered around WeChat, which runs on any operating system.", "That makes Apple simply another smartphone vendor, which is a tricky place to be at. As Apple’s “hardware differentiated by software” advantage erodes in China, what it continues to have is its brand advantage in a society that craves status and luxury.", "This remains an advantage, but it’s also one that Apple needs to re-earn with every release, which is a very high bar to clear."]}

Anything data related is subject to privacy issues and anti-trust issues.", "This is at the core of the controversy with Facebook and Google.", "Roku is again set apart here, as the company only does OTT. The company does not share the data beyond the OTT player it owns.", "Amazon, however, is collecting data in a way that could come under anti-trust scrutiny as they take e-commerce data and broker this on the OTT player, which is anti-competitive with other ad exchanges.", "Amazon is well aware of this, and is being proactive rather than reactive by opening up its demand-side platform to other DSPs, such as The Trade Desk, which was announced in July of this year.", "On a side note, Facebook learn from Amazon’s playbook as reputational damage is hard to shake.", "Roku, however, does not need to worry about this as data never leaves the OTT hardware that they own, where they have a first-party relationship.", "Connected TV ads are ballooning because they combine audience data with the viewability and completion rates of linear television.", "Roku’s valuation at 14 price-to-sales seems high at first, yet the one-year forward price-to-sales is trading at 9.3 due to the forward growth opportunity in Connected TV ads.", "Roku earnings estimates for 2020 and 2021 are $-0.29 and $0.6178 respectively.

I tried MAPE, but ran into the same issue where the early errors pulled the table down too much.", "I highlighted 72 million because I drilled into that specific range and that’s the model that gets the absolute best fit.", "This means that ultimately I see Netflix total market for streamers at about 72 million in the United States for streaming subscribers.", "Listen, I really like the above fit, but no model is perfect. Here are the critiques I would level at myself:", "– First, the sample size is pretty small. We only used annual data points which means we have sample sizes of 21 and 13 respectively.", "– Second, this model has a “margin of error”, but using this method I couldn’t really tell you what it is in a rigorous fashion.", "Netflix won’t end up with precisely 72 million subscribers, so the eventual numbers will be off in some fashion.", "– Third, I had to make assumptions about the streaming adoption in the early time period and DVD-only customers in the later period.", "Assumptions are always a source of risk/error. I’d add that in the streaming only model, my initial assumptions seem a bit low and likely Netflix had some more early adoption than I assume.", "(They had a large installed base of customers to quickly adopt is my explanation.)", "– Fourth, this year really is critical. And hence will impact the model. If the content works and Netflix adds 8% subscribers from last year’s end, 75 million looks more likely.", "– Fifth, and most importantly, using “current subscribers” versus “total subscribers” really is a problem here.", "It’s huge. Frankly, Netflix used to report gross versus net subscribers, and when you see those numbers (you will), you forget how many people churned in and out of Netflix every year.", "In short, there’s a chance Netflix has actually had a much higher total streamer adoption than these numbers, they just haven’t shared that.", "– I’d add, this is one of those times I wish I had peer review. So I welcome feedback. One of the joys of writing is that the inter webs have way more eyes than I do, so I get tons of great recommendations/feedback.", "Implications – Why This Matters & How You Can Use This", "Despite those caveats—and honestly, how few prediction brokers are willing to tell you why their model may be wrong?—I think we can learn a few crucial insights from this data.", "In particular, the idea that Netflix will grow until it sucks up all the oxygen in the media universe doesn’t hold up to this scrutiny.", "If there are 120 million households in the US, well, Netflix is going to miss about 48 million of them unless it changes its business model.", "Specifically too, Netflix won’t hit the high end of Reed Hasting’s forecast unless growth rapidly reaccelerates.", "Netflix has previously forecast 60-90 million total US subscribers. But that’s the thing with innovative product diffusion: growth hardly ever just “pick ups” to mid-to-high double digit growth after it slows.", "Especially as a stream of streaming competitors enters the market. And as cash flow pressures force price increases.", "(Which is another caveat I’d love to know: how did artificially low prices impact growth rates? There’s a Bass Model for that, but I’m not skilled enough to deploy it.)", "Other streamers can learn something too. If you built your model for 120 million US customers, I’d seriously reconsider that.", "For a low end, consider using Netflix as a stand-in for all streamers. That’s probably more accurate, honestly.", "So for Disney+, if it is a “family-focused” brand, and 40% of households are families, well Disney+ nets out to 28 million subscribers in the US.", "That would mean it won’t catch Netflix anytime soon.", "After I finish a model like this, I try to find other estimates. I couldn’t find any Netflix-specific estimates in academic articles but just last week, I found The Hollywood Reporter published an article by Simon Murray that forecasts that Netflix will add 10 million subscribers in the next five years.", "Hey, that matches my estimate too! (I’ve seen other Netflix forecasts predicting similar slow downs too.)", "Then today, I saw an article that is way back at the high end, with THR reporting the investment company is forecasting 90 million subscribers in the next ten years.", "Honestly, I’d take this model built on data over subscriber survey results.", "Three specific projects leap off the page for me. First, if I used the quarterly data in the model developed, we’d essentially quadruple our data set.", "Which would add some noise to the data, but again more data points.", "Second, international, right? Of course, we’re much farther from the inflection point for growth and we have even fewer data points to choose from.", "Plus, you could do both “global” penetration and “international” (everything not US), so I’ll have to play with that model.", "Third, attempt to do all “streamer” adoption versus “Netflix only”. Similarly, I could run the analysis to “cord cutting”, which I’ve been mulling.", "Or to focus on Hulu or another streamer, if we have enough data to do it.

the world.", "In a number of countries, the total number of social media ‘users’ actually exceeds the total eligible population by a considerable margin.", "We’ve capped our eligible penetration figures at 99 percent though, because it’s unrealistic to expect that everybody in a country uses social media, and it’s also likely that some of these ‘users’ will represent duplicate accounts.",

people using social media in Iran has also grown considerably in the past year.", "The team at Techrasa and local social media expert Niki Aghaei both concurred that annual user growth is well into double digits, and even official government sources have reported strong growth.", "The five-year growth figures for social media users are even more striking than those for internet use, with the

18.", "There’s still a meaningful gender imbalance across overall social media audiences too, but – as we’ll see below – this varies markedly at the individual platform level.", "In general, countries with the lowest overall social media penetration are also those countries with the greatest male skew.", "While these figures are specific to social media users, they’re likely representative of

employment, and empowerment, ensuring more equal internet access for women must be a priority for the next phase of internet development.", "The amount of time that people spend on social media has increased again this year, albeit very slightly.", "GlobalWebIndex reports that the average social media user now spends 2 hours and 16 minutes each day on social platforms – up from 2 hours and 15 minutes last year – which equates to roughly one-third of their total internet time, and one-seventh of their waking lives.", "As with internet use, this time quickly adds up: if we extend this average daily time across all 3.484 billion people using social media today, we get a combined total of almost 330 million years of human time spent on social platforms during the course of 2019.",

minutes – and 40 percent – longer each day on social compared to this time in 2014.", "However, not all of that time is spent ‘being sociable’.

The platform has lost one in every seven of its US advertising audience since October 2018, and Snapchat’s total advertising audience in the country has now dropped below 100 million.", "My assessment of these numbers is that what previously made Snapchat appealing may also be contributing to its present declines.", "The platform has consistently appeared to focus on younger users – particularly those in the 13 to 24 year-old age bracket.", "However, people in these age groups tend to be more fickle in their social media behaviors, and while this targeted approach may have served Snapchat well in previous years, the platform seems to be struggling to maintain its appeal amongst its core audiences.", "Crucially, Instagram now boasts almost twice as many users as Snapchat in the same age bracket – and Instagram’s numbers are still growing.", "Furthermore, unlike Twitter, there’s little evidence in other data to hint at a remedy for Snapchat’s ails.", "The focused functionality of Snapchat’s platform was part of its initial success, but that focus leaves the company with fewer options now that the strategy seems to be delivering less favorable returns.", "So, once again, I’ll concur with the predictions of Prof Galloway: there’s a good chance that Snapchat will rethink its prior aversion to acquisition over the coming months.", "Fortunately, we return to good news in our analysis of LinkedIn.

The simple formula for success is to continuously attract more users onto the platform(s) and keep them engaged for longer so you can sell more ads.", "This is easier said than done. Twitter is my favourite social media platform, but not my favourite social media business.", "The company reported 321 million MAUs – and a back-of the envelope calculation translates this user base into revenue of around US$2.83 per user. 321 million users sounds good in that it’s almost the size of the US population.", "However, this number is still down from 330 million in Q4 2017 and down from 326 million in Q3 2018.

Let’s assess the above below:", "1. TWTR is losing users but is getting better at showing ads to those who still engage on its platforms.", "However one might try to package it, growth in mDAU does not make up for loss in MAUs. TWTR is struggling to make its platform(s) ‘sticky’ and keep more of us on there for longer - and is now overcompensating by showing more ads to fewer people.", "2. TWTR wants to make a statement by marketing itself as ‘more transparent’ in its presentation of user numbers.", "However, Facebook reported stronger growth from a higher base – reporting 9% growth both in Daily Active Users (DAUs) and MAUs, with the numbers being 1.52 billion and 2.32 billion respectively.", "Transparency and user growth don't have to be mutually exclusive.", "TWTR now has four profitable quarters behind it, but it seems the only revenue growth channel left is to extract more dollars from fewer users.", "The company has done relatively well to add 106 million users since 2013, however that only amounts to 49% growth in more than 5 years.", "Where to next for the blue bird? I see two possible solutions, both of which have been suggested by analysts in the past:", "- Apple, Netflix and Spotify have all shown the value in building a subscription business on top of a platform.", "With a user experience as entrenched as that of TWTR, a nominal monthly fee of even US$1, or $12/yr, and would generate an additional US$3.85b for the company every year from its current MAU base.", "- Assuming that paying to access TWTR would cause 30% of users to leave the platform, the remaining 224.7million users would still add US$2.7b to the company’s top line if they chose to accept this subscription model.", "That extra cashflow would greatly assist TWTR in improving its algorithms and perhaps acquiring platforms in other spaces (podcast platforms seem to be the flavor of the month) and these could supplement TWTR’s online and offline value-add to the user base.", "For the stockholder who bought at the All Time High: A Buyout", "My personal view is that TWTR would unlock greater value as part of a greater media and entertainment group (an acquisition was once attempted by Disney).", "I see strong synergies between a hypothetical ‘Twisney’ tie-up along the following lines:", "- Disney + Twitter-Lite: Disney could unlock the user growth that TWTR so badly needs. With Disney’s appeal across various age groups and demographics, a ‘Twitter-lite’ platform for kids which would allow them to interact as they consume Disney content may draw younger users from all over the world onto the platform.", "Their real-time feedback could also feed into an algo that tells Disney what’s hot and what’s not, and this could be used to direct content production and marketing efforts.", "- ESPN + Twitter: A more focused TwESPN partnership could provide a stronger advertising channel for TWTR.", "A pay-per-view model for high-viewership sports games would allow TWTR to attract users by showing the sports they want to watch, whilst picking up valuable insights into users’ sports viewership consumption habits.", "TWTR could then package that data to gyms, sports apparel retailers, nutrition and health companies and sports teams to facilitate access to a captive audience.", "- Disney+: Integrating TWTR into DisneyPlus would give Disney the opportunity to tap into TWTR’s user base for subscription revenue whilst being able to pick up real-time feedback and comments to get an edge on Netflix.", "Now that we’ve highlighted the trouble with TWTR, the next step is to evaluate the numbers. The company is now more than 12 years old and is running out of excuses for lack of growth.", "Q4 2018 revenue was US$909m a more than 2x improvement on what it used to make in an entire year just over 6 years ago.", "With minimal revenue coming from its Data Licensing arm, there’s no question that TWTR makes its money from ads.", "The stable revenue growth and user base declines suggest to me that TWTR has limited pricing power, and advertisers can credibly threaten to move their business to Facebook, Snapchat, Amazon or Google.", "This also tells me that TWTR is not a global business in the true sense. The company’s algorithms, while good, have most of their effectiveness in the US + Canada region as well as in Japan, its second largest market.", "All of that adds up to mean that TWTR can’t create very deep/broad or highly accurate categories of buyers that advertisers can tap into to save on their marketing costs by selling us what they already know we want.", "The #fact is, unlike on Facebook, our retweets and likes don’t easily convert into dollars for the company.", "TWTR has historically struggled to get a firm grip on expenses. This is why profitability took over a decade, and more than 5 years after listing.", "However, to management’s credit, TWTR has managed to decrease costs from 120% of revenue in 2015 to 79% of revenue in 2018.", "Revenue has also grown from US$2.2b to just over US$3b over the same period, an increment of 37%. See Table 1 below:", "Table 1: TWTR Total Costs and Expenses vs Revenue: 2015 to 2018.

Numbers taken from TWTR annual reports", "Chart 2: Revenue and Income Trends, 2015 – 2018. Numbers taken from TWTR annual reports", "TWTR has grown revenue by 37%, income from operations has grown from -20% to 15% of revenue, whilst net income has grown from -23% to 8% of revenue.", "This leaves TWTR with very thin margins with which to reinvest in the business and compete in the platform-based advertising space.", "Again, this is portentous in the context of increasing competition as more and more platforms (Reddit, Facebook, Snap, Spotify, Pinterest) compete for the attention of at least one of our senses to generate advertising revenue.", "TWTR still has a lot to do to develop a track record of financial performance that will convince investors to go bullish on the stock again.", "The company also doesn't appear to have a sustainable moat or particularly good growth prospects in its highly competitive space for our attention.", "The management team has done well to improve the company from a negative position over the past couple of years, but not enough to to inspire confidence of strong returns on the stock over time.", "I love the platform and wish the company well but wouldn’t recommend the stock on what I know today.", "5yTwitter has definitely not managed to have the exponential and rapid growth in revenues in a short period of time, like Facebook.", "I definitely think they should be open to the Twitter and Disney partnership or Twitter and ESPN.

I have to say I am a little skeptical about the use of data for what I see as a very creative product.", "I know that data informed decisions can do things like greenlight Orange is the New Black, but I fear that if you use data to create a formulaic production, it won’t have the same heart.", "And I also wonder if using data to see what’s gaining traction is really a new concept. There have always been ratings and ways to measure viewership.", "Of course the time something was showing played a factor, but it’s not like we were operating in a world without data that now has come to light.", "I just wonder how valuable it really is, and if you couldn’t make similar recommendations without all of this data jsut knowing basic demographics of your users.", "Realistically you don’t want it to be TOO personalized because you still want to allow for serendipity/discovery.", "Thanks for a great post! I completely agree that the smart application of big data has been Netflix’s winning strategy.", "However, as more players are aware of and equipped with data analytics capabilities, I think the accuracy of the data insights would become the differentiating factor.", "I would be curious to see how Netflix is going to sustain its advantage over time.", "I really enjoyed this article. I wonder if too much data my steer Netflix the wrong way as it looks to grow its business and expand into different markets.", "I absolutely love what they are doing, especially in terms of their geographic diversification strategy, and think there are clear values that are captured by both the company and the subscribers.", "I have however witnessed a decline in customer engagement and interface improvements. More data provides the company with more opportunity, but as it grows perhaps Netflix should consider separating its production units.", "I also believe there is a myriad of different factors that contribute to the success of a movie, so I wonder how useful the data is with time as the creative/human aspect of production decreases and ideas narrow in to similar categories.", "Thanks for your thoughtful and valuable contribution, Sean! Your description of Netflix’s recommendation engine reminds me of the perennial dilemma on the “echo chamber” effect of information retrieval and aggregation systems.", "Recommending similar digital contents may indeed drive engagement metrics in the short run, but may also shield the users from discovering thrilling new content like they’ve never seen before.", "Going forward, how can Netflix leverage its data analytics capability to strike the fine balance between content relevance vs. content discovery?", "Great post Sean! I think your point that “analytics does not solely drive creative decisions; Netflix still involves production studios and creative staff to make shows a reality” is particularly interesting and a concern for me as I think about the company’s future.", "Do you think there will ever be a point where Netflix becomes more like a movie studio with a core competency in data-driven decision making as opposed to a personalized streaming platform that also produces shows?", "I’m not sure if the company is already doing this now, but I foresee Netflix striking exclusive development deals with smaller studios (maybe the likes of A24 or Annapurna Pictures), or even outright acquisition of a studio."]}

Streaming appeals to many because it allows users to watch wherever and whenever they want, as long as there is a stable Internet connection (although some streaming services even allow downloadable content).", "This represents a notable departure from cable TV, which only comes in the form of live TV and recorded content via a cable box.", "Another perk is that many streaming services are ad-less, and provide a lot of instant content for cheap prices.", "Cable averages to $107 per month, whereas Netflix, a popular streaming service, charges only $12.99 per month for their standard plan.", "Even Youtube TV offers cable services for $50 per month.

This venture into streaming has since propelled the company to stratospheric heights, allowing its valuation to be in excess of $100B. Netflix’s streaming service was modest at first, with a simple interface and few shows, but has since grown dramatically.", "Hulu introduced streaming shortly after in 2008, focusing more on TV shows than Netflix.", "At first, both Hulu and Netflix began by licensing other networks’ content, gathering a wide variety of B-rated movies and TV shows.", "This type of service is often referred to as a “clearinghouse” for other networks’ content. Just as clearinghouses in finance facilitate collection and movement of securities, the streaming clearinghouses facilitate the collection of various media to entertain consumers.", "While networks were often hesitant to give up rights to popular content, clearinghouses capitalized on the fact that people would settle for less popular shows at a lower price.", "Cult classics such as “The Office” and “Friends” gained popularity, and now account for over 10% of all content watched on Netflix alone.", "With the advent of Netflix, many people realized they could substitute the utility derived from cable television with that of these streaming services.", "While few have replaced cable entirely, Netflix’s introduction of iOS and Android apps in 2010 made the service more portable than ever, and significantly more accessible compared to cable TV.", "This competition is evident as cable prices have remained relatively stagnant, only rising 1% from 2017 to 2018.", "The rise of Netflix was aided by technological advancements, such as improvements in Internet speeds and an explosion of mobile devices.", "Internet speed increases cut loading times, making streaming a more reliable source of entertainment.", "During that same time period, the number of mobile devices owned by Americans skyrocketed, allowing for easier use of common streaming apps.", "In the absence of detailed viewer data, which remains a corporate secret, Netflix’s stock prices are indicative of its success.", "Its stock price increase in late 2009 signaled an increase in investor confidence in the streaming business and an expansion in streaming demand as a whole.", "In another large departure from tradition, Netflix transitioned to becoming a part clearinghouse and part production company.", "To run the clearinghouse model, Netflix had to license all of its content from third parties, which ate into its profit margins.", "The rights were entirely owned by the third party production firms, who could therefore price shop among different streaming services.", "As Netflix did not hold a patent on streaming technology, their profits were being competed away by other streaming services entering the industry.", "This made implementing in-house production a viable substitute for licensing content from production companies.", "The launch of the critically acclaimed shows “House of Cards” and “Orange is the New Black” in 2013 signaled this change, and exemplified the potential of a non-network production company.", "An advantage of this approach is that it keeps people subscribed to the streaming service, even if some of their favorite shows move somewhere else.", "Production companies often have exclusive control over the content they create, which means if enough people are interested in it, it will differentiate their product.", "This type of competition, known as monopolistic competition, occurs when firms can differentiate their products from one another but there are no barriers to entering the industry or copying another business’ model.", "Therefore, firms can only run short term positive profits until they are competed away. This production model is differentiated from the clearinghouse model in which the services provided are relatively homogenous and therefore closer to perfect competition.", "Streaming services used production to their advantage, just as many cable networks do on a regular basis.", "Many streaming companies that began as clearinghouses took the same route Netflix did; notable cases include Amazon Prime Video with their introduction of “Transparent” in 2014 and Hulu Originals with “The Handmaid’s Tale” in 2017.", "Over 110 different streaming services currently exist, offering sports, live TV, movies, international TV and many more options.", "This explosion can be explained by the very low barriers to entry around streaming.

Companies can even make it harder to stream and use content across devices, often by creating competing services.", "Many companies offer package deals to keep customers fully invested in the ecosystem, similar to the bundling options offered by cable and telecommunications companies.", "No one knows exactly what the future holds for the streaming industry. At the moment the fragmented mix of clearinghouse and original content is confusing for companies and consumers alike.", "Additionally, with many traditional networks and cable companies playing catch up to match the staggering profits of streaming services, the field can be expected to change drastically in the next couple of years.", "Part of the reason it is hard to predict the future of streaming is that consumers’ preferences are currently unknown.", "Viewers may prefer the clearinghouse approach, which would then encourage companies to cross-pollinate TV shows with one another.", "People may begin to subscribe to multiple streaming services, handpicking those with the hottest shows or the most content.", "Alternatively, consumers may find online cable most attractive. In this new era, companies will likely need to adapt quickly to consumer preferences to stay competitive, and consistently introduce new products to strip competitors of their customers.", "For streaming to survive, internet speeds must also rise to keep up with data-heavy demands of streaming.", "Fortunately, internet service providers are already fully prepared. Speedtest.net reports in their global index that 170 out of the 176 countries measured have average speeds that meet Netflix’s Internet connection speed recommendations of 5 MB/s.

streams and then on top of it, had to buy servers, at least until Linux came along.", "In some cases, Windows Media Server deployments inside CDNs at the time cost 75% less than RealServer to deploy.", "As a result, some content delivery networks started charging content owners a premium to deliver content in RealNetwork’s format versus Microsoft’s.", "Content owners started re-thinking why they should spend more money to deliver content using RealNetworks’ platform when Microsoft’s media server elements, encoder and player software was all free.", "Microsoft really ramped up their marketing that year and even brought out Bill Gates as their keynote speaker at the Streaming Media West conference in December of 1999 to highlight the use of digital audio and video, as the “next major wave of Internet computing.”", "At the same time, little known to anyone outside of a small group of industry insiders, throughout 1999 and 2000, Microsoft had been quietly giving content delivery networks and webcasting production companies millions of dollars in what they called “net credits”.", "The idea was that these vendors could go to content owners and tell them that they would convert and host the customers content in the Windows Media format, and Microsoft would pay the cost, usually for the year.", "The service provider I worked for at the time got hundreds of thousands of dollars in net credits in just one year, and larger CDNs like InterVU, iBEAM and others got millions.", "This was the peak of the streaming media industry, late 1999, with lots of Microsoft dollars flowing into the market, which helped many of these vendors, like InterVU, build out their network for scale.", "Only a year later, InterVU would be bought by Akamai in a stock swap valued at roughly $2.8 billion and Microsoft’s net credit dollars was a big reason for InterVU’s growth.", "While Microsoft and RealNetworks competed with one another, both companies really had a different strategy and vision for their platforms.", "Microsoft’s primary interest wasn’t in defeating RealNetworks as a format/player, its real motive was in containing licensing costs for codecs.", "Taking the then license for MP3 and MPEG2 and including those technologies in Windows was going to cost Microsoft as insane $600 million per year of top line revenue.", "Had RealNetworks established their own codecs as the defacto standard, Microsoft could have been forced to license RealNetwork’s technology for even more money.", "It cost far, far less for Microsoft to buy a codec company and spend a fortune developing an ecosystem then it did to take these licenses.", "Another big difference was that unlike RealNetworks, Microsoft didn’t care as much about their player, it was created to make Windows better.", "It was considered a Windows component and important, but much of the development effort went into the server, format, and codecs.", "RealNetworks was much more of a “front-end” company and the main thing RealNetworks cared about was their player and the revenue from it.", "Everything else they did was designed to support their player, which was evident by the fact that even though RealPlayer was free, there was also a plus version that came with more functionality but cost users $29.99.", "In 2000, at the crest of the Internet bubble, RealNetworks and Microsoft both came out with newer versions of their platforms and worked hard to out maneuver one another with more features and functionality.", "RealNetworks also announced they had more than “75 million regular users” of

As RealNetworks CEO said in a letter to shareholders in 2000, “the underlying drivers for the change in our financial results are not trivial”, but the company felt the impact of these changes would only take “several months to work through.”", "In reality, the industry had been setting itself up for failure by setting financial expectations and guidance that vendors had no shot of reaching.", "Many originally dismissed this as market growing pains because they were blinded by greed, a wave of exuberance and were sacrificing growth over profits.", "They wanted to believe all was well. But in late 2000, the unrealistic and self-inflated numbers finally started to catch up with the majority of companies, in all Internet sectors, and investors took notice.", "For many the money was gone and funding dried up as investors begun to realize they were on the losing end of tens, if not hundreds of billions of dollars.", "The dot com bubble burst caused the loss of $5 trillion in the market value of companies between 2000-2002.", "When the larger Internet bubble burst, it trickled down into every segment of the market, including the streaming media industry.", "Content owners that were rushing to get all their content online quickly realized they had no way to make money from it and started to pull back.", "Advertising dollars dried up.

Those vendors that did survive, really scaled down their operations and stopped spending money, cutting costs anywhere they could.", "By my estimate, at least 75% of all the vendors in the streaming media industry went out of business between late 2000 through the end of 2002.", "To put it in perspective, at the 2000 Streaming Media West trade show, there were over 700 exhibitors on the show floor.", "When the show was started back up again in 2004, there was a total of 24 exhibitors.", "In March of 2001, RealNetworks announced a three-year deal with Major League Baseball to create a subscription service including live audio webcasts.", "While it was the biggest premium content deal in the market at the time, and important for the progression of the industry, it came as the market was crashing.", "Only four months later, in July, RealNetworks laid off 15% of their employees as their revenue from server licenses to companies that had gone bankrupt and advertising revenue started to disappear fast.", "Contracts went into default, companies couldn’t collect what they were owed and many vendors had to lay off employees.", "RealNetworks quickly tried to change their business model and source of revenue by starting a content subscription service called RealOne, which they launched in December of 2001.", "A month later they had 500,000 paying subscribers, but it wasn’t enough.", "Seven months later, in August of 2002, RealNetworks did another round of layoffs, this time 11% of their company, closed selected offices and canceled their annual user conference.", "By now, the battle between RealNetworks and Microsoft was almost over, as the market for video services on the Internet literally disappeared.", "New content wasn’t going online and no major improvements to streaming media technology was being developed.", "In 2002, RealNetworks introduced their Helix initiative, along with their Helix Universal Server and released substantial parts of the source code under an open source license.", "But it was the end of RealNetworks as an audio and video platform. Between 2000-2002, RealNetworks lost 51% of their revenue from software license fees and 83% of their advertising revenue.", "Microsoft came out with Windows Media 9 in September of 2002 and it offered better quality than Real, was free as part of the Windows platform and had the tools and ecosystem that content owners needed.", "It was at this time in the industry, when the market shifted and it was no longer about codecs and formats.", "Helix was the last major software release for RealNetworks which then got into the music business, including a partnership with Sony later that year, and launched one of the first major efforts to sell and deliver music from major record labels over the Internet.", "In the following years RealNetworks acquired music services and gaming companies and was out of the streaming media platform market.", "And just like that, in less than 18 months, arguably the most important company responsible for the growth of the streaming media industry was no longer in the market they started.", "But that wouldn’t be the last the industry would hear from them. In 2003, RealNetworks filed a federal antitrust lawsuit against Microsoft for anti-competitive practices, for amongst other things, bundling their Windows Media Player with the Windows operating system and bundling its media-server software with its server operating system.", "Two years later, in October of 2005, Microsoft settled with RealNetworks agreeing to pay a $460 million up-front cash payment to resolve all damages claims and gave RealNetworks long-term access to important Windows Media technologies that enhanced Real’s media software solutions.", "RealNetworks is still around today, but gets most of their revenue from games and other sources of online content and software.", "By 2005, Microsoft’s streaming media division, which had been renamed to the Digital Media Division with over 1,500 employees, and fell under the Windows Platform team, had served its purpose.", "Windows Media streaming won out and as result, Windows Servers had value over Linux. And with Microsoft being involved in codec development that lead to many patents, and these becoming part of H.264, Microsoft directly changed the pricing for H.264 through years of effort.", "As a result, Microsoft could license it for Windows unlike MPEG2, which clearly helped the industry as a whole.", "With the format battle now over, the Digital Media Division was looking for new competitors and reasons to exist.", "Apple had released iPod and iTunes for Windows, and Microsoft was struggling to figure out how to compete.", "The Digital Media Division owned this problem for Microsoft and came up with things like PlaysForSure to ‘unite’ the industry in a non-Apple ecosystem.", "But Microsoft really did not have any good solutions on how to challenge Apple as this was a whole different type of competitor.", "So post Vista, Microsoft execs did not see entertainment and streaming technologies as core to competing with the resurgent Apple.", "Streaming and codecs – “who cares, we won, and Macromedia and Adobe are not real competitors”, was the attitude of many inside Microsoft.", "After much debate at the Ballmer/Gates level, it was decided that Robbie Bach (head of Xbox) would ‘own the Apple compete problem’ since Apple was viewed as entertainment threat, not an OS threat, and certainly not a threat to the Windows Mobile group.", "With that mandate handover, the Digital Media Division was broken up in late 2005. The devices folks and subset of Windows Media Player went to work on Zune (but under the hardware device team from Xbox), and codecs and DRM went to phone group.", "Some also went to the tools team that was an offshoot group of .net that became the Silverlight group to try to compete with Flash.", "But as many who worked at Microsoft at the time would tell you, when there isn’t a competitor, Microsoft loses focus, and Flash wasn’t yet a threat.", "While Microsoft beat RealNetworks in the end, years later, Apple would beat everyone following the intro of the iPod and iPhone.", "Adobe would then take over with Flash, but even that became irrelevant with HTML5 and also lead to the death of Silverlight.", "In the end, Microsoft, Real and Adobe would all lose out in the video format/platform market, twenty years after it started.", "It’s also worth noting that all of these video platforms would have gone nowhere if it wasn’t for content.", "Software wouldn’t have driven downloads without nothing to listen to or watch.

Spotify Premium members pay a monthly subscription fee but have access to their playlists offline on multiple devices, thus having all the perks of owning the music while just paying $120 a year.", "Beyond that, Spotify is known for their social media interaction – users can interact with their friends and share playlists, and users can also follow the playlists of their favorite artists.", "Songs can be found by title, artist, or cd name, and various apps are available to enhance the service, such as radio streaming.", "Sean Parker, founder of Napster, invested $15M in Spotify through the venture capital firm the Founder’s Fund, and provided invaluable services with assistance in creating deals with music labels and with Facebook (Seufer, pg 23).", "A year after their initial launch Spotify had 6.5 million registered users, but as of May 2014 they now have 10 million paid subscribers and an additional 30 million registered users and they were valued at $4 billion in November of 2013 (Brustein, 2014) and $5 billion by May of 2014 (Kiendl, 2014).", "The contracts with music labels are structured so that 70% of all revenue Spotify earns goes directly to royalties, with a Spotify Artists page available on their website for full transparency of how this is calculated and all that Spotify does to protect the artists.", "The artists page also provides data and statistics about the benefits music streaming has had to the industry.", "Spotify links to research that proves 55% of 18-29 year olds pirate less when offered a free and legal alternative, that between 2009 and 2011 in Sweden (the launch of Spotify) the number of people who pirated music dropped by 25%, and that in Norway, which has the highest digital revenues per capita, from 2008 to 2012 the number of pirated songs dropped from 1.2 billion to 210 million.", "The Spotify brand identity revolves around the phrase “the right music for every moment” with the guiding principles of being easy, personal, and fun.", "The goal is to make sure that everyone can easily use Spotify, that they can personalize and find the music that they truly love, and have fun not only listening to their own playlists but discovering new music, connecting with their friends through social media, following their favorite artist, and many other services.", "Take for example their recent deal with Sprint – the only US phone company that Spotify entered into business with after holding discussion with all of the major brands.", "Ek, CEO of Spotify, stated that he was only looking for “genuine enthusiasm” and brands that were serious about music, not a company looking to profit.", "Ek embodies the fun yet dedicated to music spirit that Spotify wants to represent: he has guitars hanging in his office and instead of a desk he has chairs and couches, and he is a certified tour guide in Stockholm (Brustein, 2014).", "Spotify has been working to grow and recreate the music industry since it was first launched in 2008.", "A lot of Spotify’s strengths revolve around the new industry standard it has created. From the beginning, Spotify has always been promoting itself as the music streaming option that helps the industry’s artists.", "Out of all the revenue Spotify earns at the end of the month, 70% of it goes back to the record labels and artists.", "Since Spotify pays these royalties, the artists and rights holders are willing to provide Spotify with its songs.", "While some artists are against their music being streamed for free and the generally low royalties they are paid out, especially since the royalties Spotify pays goes through the record label before reaching the individual artist, Spotify is still known for being extremely transparent.", "They have an entire webpage dedicated to the artist, complete with details on how royalties are paid, how to promote their pages, and how Spotify is working to actually improve the music industry.", "They provide a direct connect between the artist and the listener, with the ability for artists to create their own playlists and sell their merchandise directly to their fans.", "The major strength of Spotify though is the service itself. Spotify, upon its launch, filled a major gap in the market – no one else had offered fully customizable playlist creation before.", "They offer the same exact song catalogue, with some 20 million songs available, to all of its consumers, regardless of whether or not they subscribe, appealing to multiple target markets.", "Those who chose not to pay get the same great service as those with a Premium subscription – they just have advertisements.", "The revenue generated by advertisements is also split 30/70, so Spotify generates revenue with whichever option the consumer chooses.", "Premium offers the same songs, but in offline mode. The consumer can listen to their playlists even when not connected to the internet, giving a sense of total song ownership.", "This product split is a large strength for Spotify because it essentially gives consumers a “preview” of their Premium service for free.", "Thanks to their relationship with Sean Parker and having an innovative leader in Daniel Ek, Spotify has taken full advantage of social media to enhance their brand and attract new customers.", "While Spotify launched in the United States in 2011, gaining access to a very large market, their joining with Facebook may have had an even larger impact and certainly spurred their growth.", "It was not until a few months after the launch in the States when Spotify partnered with Facebook in 2011 – and within the next year their user base doubled over the next year from 10 to 20 million users (Seufert, 2014).", "Spotify users can work through Facebook to share what they are listening to and send songs to their friends, and that is not the only powerhouse Spotify teams with.", "Spotify also utilizes apps to their advantage in attracting new customers while enhancing their product offering – for example last.fm has an app available through Spotify and Rolling Stones creates playlists.", "Twitter has a Spotify app where they create playlists of songs that are trending on Twitter. They use social media not only to attract new customers, but to interact and provide a more personal experience with those already existing customers.", "Unfortunately, some of Spotify’s strengths lead to some of their weaknesses. The free version of Spotify comes with many commercials that can often be repetitive, to include repeat advertisements on joining Spotify Premium.", "While advertisements are needed to generate revenue, there are other digital streaming companies that allow customers to listen to music for free with few or no commercials, such as Songza.", "Spotify wants their Premium user base to grow, but retaining customers in the free portion of their service is still crucial for maintaining revenues.", "With their large royalty payouts each month, it cannot afford to cut back on commercials and ads that interrupt its customer’s listening.", "So if a customer is not sold on the value of Spotify, they are likely to move to another company that will satisfy their needs at a lower cost.", "Their major benefit of customizable playlists is also a weakness – all of their development goes towards this area, and they are behind their competitors with a recommendation option.", "They have no algorithm in place for recommending new songs and bands to listeners, so the user must discover new music on their own or through other sources.", "Spotify is the best in their field for customization, but through their lack of a comprehensive recommendation algorithm they are potentially driving their target market to use other services.", "Spotify has to also deal with the potential alienation of the artists. While they are transparent with their royalty payouts and are extremely generous with the portion of their revenue that goes directly to said payments, the streaming industry itself is seen in a negative light by the very artist that they are trying to court.", "Streaming music is a relatively new industry and it cannot be denied that it is, at this point in time, taking revenue from the artist.", "Previously if a listener wanted a song, they would have to pay to download it or download it illegally.", "While the artist was not paid for the illegal download, the paid download was a clear and precise number that they received and the artist knew how many people purchased their song.", "With Spotify and other streaming services songs are listened to substantially more, but the individual payout per song listened to is much smaller, and many artists in general are against this new trend in music listening.", "Spotify’s attempts at transparency and communication, while much better than their competitors, still struggles to reach most artists.", "Spotify has established a steady market niche for itself, but it still has lot of opportunities.

As customers use the free package option, they know they are only getting a glimpse of everything Spotify has to offer.", "As users become loyal to Spotify, the idea of paying a monthly premium will not be an issue. Spotify has been working to end piracy of music.", "The opportunity to completely eliminate piracy is becoming more of a reality as consumers are turning to free music platforms.", "This is an opportunity for the entire music industry, not just Spotify.", "Spotify has room to create an algorithm and enhance their recommendations for new music, currently they just have a fairly weak discovery tool.", "The more music they entice their users to listen to, the more loyal they will become and the more free users might be tempted to switch to Premium.", "Spotify also has some great opportunities with working directly with the artists. Through BandPage they are starting to sell merchandise directly to the listener, but this is definitely an area that that they need to work to expand in.", "This opportunity will benefit both the artist and the listener – the listener will feel more connected to their favorite bands through this interaction and this will allow for the artists to earn more revenue.", "Piracy of music may be on the decline, but it is still a major threat to the music industry. Even though there are free options available, they are not necessarily available everywhere around the world.", "Spotify and other companies in the music industry will be fighting this threat until every music user has other options besides illegally downloaded music.", "Spotify is also facing threats that others in the industry are not facing. The royalties that Spotify pays out each month is 70% of its total monthly revenue.", "There are many free options available to customers, and if Spotify does not make enough money through ads or monthly fees it may lose money.", "If Spotify is unable to get the number of customers they need to break-even, they may not be able to support its music database and it may not be able to provide its customers with the services they have come to expect.", "Another threat Spotify faces is the growth of one of its competitors, Beats Music. Beats Music offers the same type of service as Spotify, just not as well developed.", "This will be discussed more in-depth during our Five Forces Analysis, but with the purchase of Beats Music by Apple they could become more appealing to customers.", "There is also a possibility they could change the industry in the way Spotify has been striving to achieve.", "Spotify stands on solid ground even in a saturated market with numerous competitors such as Pandora, Beats Music, Songza, and I Heart Radio, among numerous others.", "While Spotify does not have the algorithms used by their major competitor Pandora to provide playlists to customer based off of consumer preferences, they have an extremely large catalog and the ability for users to create custom playlists, a service that Pandora does not provide.", "Beats Music offers the music discovery recommendations that Spotify has limited experience in, but this puts them more towards competing with the services provided by Pandora.", "Beats Music also has no free option – the user must immediately pay the $10 monthly fee if they want to pay on a month by month basis, or roughly $100 for a years subscription if they commit to a full year contract, whereas Spotify can entice new users with a free offering to try out the service after which users can seamlessly transfer their playlists into the subscription offering.", "The biggest concern faced by Spotify is the purchase of Beats Music by Apple. Apple can promote the service heavily to their already dedicated consumers and Apple could, much like WalMart did, use their market power to get lower royalty rates.", "It appears at this point that Apple is mostly interested in Beats Electronics, which pulls in over a billion in revenue on an annual basis, but Spotify still needs to closely follow the deal.", "We will discuss the industry rival first, as the current forces faced by Spotify will be changing in the near future as the acquisition by Apple of Beats Music is completed.", "Industry rivalry is a medium to high risk that has been increasing as Apple purchased Beats Music. Currently Beats Music only has around 250,000 paid subscribers and is only available in the US.", "Compare that with the 10 million paid subscribers for Spotify along with the additional 30 million free users and their status as a continually expanding global operation, and the risk appears quite low.", "But with Apple purchasing Beats for $2.6 billion with plans to invest an additional $400 million in the future, and suddenly the risk of industry rivalry is quite large and a formidable obstacle.", "While Spotify already has committed users, Apple is a global force with an extremely loyal customer base, not to mention the ability to add Beats Music to all of their applications and services, which could cut a large portion of Spotify’s customers.", "Spotify is currently valued at $5 billion, which is substantially more than the entirety of Beats, to include Music and Electronics, but both are measly in comparison with the net worth of Apple.", "The competitive advantage that Spotify has in this situation is the fact that they have a free version that provides the same exact services and benefits, something which Beats Music does not.", "As Spotify has grown and expanded, the free service has always been substantially more popular with widespread use.", "Not to mention, it provides potential Premium users with the ability to preview the service for a long period of time before making the choice to buy – until recently there was no option to even preview Beats Music and now they just have a 14-day trial period (Breen, 2014).", "CEO Ek is also brushing off most concerns about the Apple acquisition, at least publically. An example provided by Ek is how both Google and Amazon tried to compete with Dropbox, but even facing two huge competitors with a wide user base did not have a negative impact – Dropbox still has 275 million users.", "Another example is how, in 2013, Apple launched iTunes Radio to directly compete with Pandora, but Pandora’s user base had grown by 4 million people 8 months after the launch.", "(Brustein, 2014). Spotify has also partnered with goliaths such as The Coca-Cola Company and received investments from Goldman Sachs, among others.", "The bargaining power of suppliers faced by Spotify is, at this point in their operation, quite low. There are a few artists that refuse to have their music available through streaming, but those decisions are usually made across the board and are not specific to one service, such as Spotify.", "Typically if an artist is against streaming their music, they do not allow it to be streamed by any provider.", "Beyond a large blackout such as that, Spotify holds considerable sway when in other discussion with artists.", "For example, Adele refused to have her album 21 available for free users of Spotify and requested that it only be available for Premium users.", "Spotify, who prides itself on offering the same large catalogue to all users, rejected this request. The album was not available to any level of user, only to become available to all users at a later date (Maloney, 2012).", "Spotify negotiates to enter each country individually, but so far has been successful in doing so and there does not appear to be any potential risk or denial of entering a future market.", "Canada, which Spotify recently entered on an invitation only basis with plans to launch to all users in the near future, proved for difficult negotiations, but those were across all streaming services and not unique just to Spotify.", "In the case of Canada, negotiations were by the Copyright Board of Canada and not unique and individual record labels.", "That being said, this could transition into a major future risk for Spotify when Beats Music is fully acquired by Apple.", "In 2013, AC/DC and Bob Seger finally allowed for iTunes to sell their music, but still refused for their songs to be available for streaming and Led Zeppelin was searching for an exclusive deal that they found no offerors for.", "With the market power of Apple behind Beats Music, they could open negotiations for lucrative deals that Spotify would be unable to match.", "They could also most likely more easily enter into deals, leaving Spotify users to wait a few months before the same songs became available, or even if they became available at all.", "The threat of substitutes is currently quite low for Spotify. While substitutes are available, Spotify itself was created as a substitute to provide unique service for music listeners.", "The key difference between Spotify and said substitutes, such as radios, is that users can create their own customizable playlists and have unlimited access to over 20 million songs.", "To be honest, the largest substitute risk for Spotify is users staying with the free version instead of upgrading to Premium.", "Even then, though, there are advertisements plays on the free version to still generate revenue for Spotify, though their ultimate goal is to reach more paid subscribers.", "The bargaining power of buyers is low as this area is completely controlled by Spotify. They have the standard, free service provided to all users and offer the Premium service for those who wish to listen offline.", "The customer has the power to make their choice, but not necessarily the power to sway Spotify in any other way.", "If the free subscriber does not want to deal with advertisements, they can choose to switch to Premium, but there is no free competitor who provides the same service for them to have any leverage in this area.", "Spotify has listened to their customers in the past for their preferences, and since their initial launch they have added various apps to meet consumer requests.", "They are continually adding new options, such as partnering with BandPage to offer artist merchandise available for purchase through Spotify.", "Once again, though, the acquisition of Beats Music must be taken into consideration as a potential future influencer of the bargaining power of the buyers for Spotify.", "It is unsure how this will play out, but Spotify needs to conduct a thorough analysis of the potential influence and must be prepared to meet buyer requests in order to stay competitive.", "Beats Music has already offered a lower priced membership when users sign a year-long contract, about $20 less than a full year of Spotify – but the user must commit to a year.", "If they choose to pay on a monthly basis the cost is still comparable with Spotify. Whether this means that they will offer less advertisements, discounted Premium subscriptions, or more services.", "In the future the bargaining power of the buyers could greatly increase in order for Spotify to stay competitive in the face of Apple.", "The threat of new entrants is quite low. At this point, the music streaming market is quite saturated and the purchase of Beats Music by Apple will most likely discourage future entry into this arena.", "Spotify has a large subscription base and is available on a global basis, and now Beats Music has the power of Apple behind them and they offer an algorithm based recommendation service like Pandora does.", "New entrants would have to conduct a thorough analysis of the market for Blue Ocean methods to enter the music streaming market, or otherwise they will be unsuccessful or only able to gain a small corner of the market.", "The prevalence of music piracy caused recorded music sales between 1999 to 2009, to decline by more than 50% (Goldman, 2010).", "The rapid decline has begun to level with the rise of streaming services such as Spotify, Pandora, iHeartRadio and other terrestrial radio alternatives.", "In 2013, physical music sales (CDs, vinyl, etc.) decreased by 12.3% ($2.27 billion decline). However, digital sales grew by 7.6% ($4.36 billion increase) (Pham, 2014).", "However, digital sales are not likely to bring the music industry back to pre-Napster levels, streaming services are predicted to stop the hemorrhaging of money the music industry has been experiencing.", "In 2013, revenue from streaming services accounted for 20% of all music industry revenue. In 2011, BusinessWeek referred to Spotify as “music’s last best hope” (Greeley, 2011)", "Streaming music is uniquely poised to generate additional revenue for the industry because of the connectedness of its users.", "On-demand music streamers are 96% more likely to follow a celebrity on a social network and 91% more likely to post links, articles, videos, or websites on social media.", "Spotify has leverage social sharing far better than Pandora by allowing users to collaborate on playlists and integrating share buttons within each song.", "In addition, the partnership with Facebook allows users to see what their friends are listening to in real-time and even listen with them.", "These socially connected individuals translate into spending as they are 90% more likely to spend money on music and 50% more likely to spend money on event tickets (The Nielson Company, 2014).", "Spotify has received criticism for its lack of profitability, leaving investors and those within the industry concerned for its overall sustainability.", "The current streaming trajectory indicates that subscription services generate almost three times as much revenue as ad supported streaming.", "Currently only one fourth of Spotify’s active users are paying subscribers. Apple recently purchased a streaming service, Beats Music which has no free plan.", "In order to be a sustainable business model, other streaming services will have to convert more of their free users to paid users or find additional revenue streams to rival the subscription service (Holmes, 2014).", "Now that an understanding of Spotify and an understanding of the steaming industry at large has been established, we applied the Four Actions Framework to the music industry as a whole so we could see how Spotify compares.", "We created an ERRC Grid with industry standards to isolate variables in order to more comprehensively analyze Spotify with a Five Forces analysis and make recommendations for Spotify moving forward.", "For the elimination portion of the grid, there are three main factors that have become the industry standard.", "First, there are only so many times you can skip a song while you listen to music. Once you use up the number of skips, depending on the streaming platform being used, you either end up listening to a long ad or no longer have the option to skip a song you might not like.", "Another factor that could be eliminated is the fact you need internet access in order to listen to music.", "If you are somewhere where you do not have service, you cannot listen to music. For example, if you are on an airplane and want to listen to during your flight, you will not be able to using streaming platforms.", "Finally, throughout the music industry there is a limitation on the number of hours you can listen to music on a streaming platform.", "Each company may place the limit on a different number of hours, but the limitation is still there. Spotify does not limit the number of skips or provide a limitation for number of hours listened, and they have an offline option provided through their Premium subscription service.", "For the reduction section of the grid, the industry requires a lot of advertisements when you are streaming music.", "This is because the majority of the industry allows a free streaming option and advertisements are necessary to make money.", "Most music streaming platforms are designed around pre-set playlists based upon genre or mood, or, like Pandora, are algorithm based and generate songs and playlists based off previous preferences.", "Both provide limited options to the user and will, at least on occasion if not more frequently, play undesirable or unwanted music.", "Combined with the limited number of skips already discussed, it becomes a sort of gamble for the average listener.", "Do you skip a song you are not interested in and risk getting “stuck” listening to a less desirable song later on?", "Or, with algorithm based services, will skipping this song change the complete sound of your established playlist if it is perceived as a change in preferences?", "There are also buffering periods for songs with many of the services. Even though this mostly due to slow internet speed it is still an area in which the industry can improve.", "Spotify provides an alternative to advertisements with their Premium service, though their free service faces the same negative aspects as the industry.", "While they have no undesirable or unwanted music, as the listener creates their own playlists, they have nothing in place for recommendations of new songs.", "They also have no buffering time with offline play and strong speed for online –their only limitation is internet speed.", "The first aspect that the industry is seeking to raise is sound quality. The songs are streamed online, so to provide additional quality is to incur additional cost.", "The platforms are also designed to be played to a room at large and are not typically aimed towards headphone use where the musical nuances are more readily noticeable.", "While the providers available also have very diverse catalogues, they are often extremely similar or, in the case of both those who are algorithm and genre based, repeat songs as the playlists are limited in the number of songs that they hold.", "The industry also has room to improve with social media networking, as the music integration into platforms such as Facebook and Twitter are lacking.", "Most platforms have apps available for song use that can interact with social media, but the interactions are limited and not a key focal point.", "Social media can be taken a step forward and should be used as a way to discover new songs, find what your friends are listening to, and should bring other industries into play.", "Spotify excels in this area as Twitter has a playlist on Spotify to play songs that are trending on Twitter, and other companies have created their own customized playlist for users to listen to.", "Spotify also has extremely strong sound quality as the music is provided offline and it is anticipated that consumers will use headphones and travel with their music.", "Spotify has over 20 million songs available in their catalogue, and there is no difference in the music that is available for the free users versus the Premium users.", "The last section of the ERRC grid is the factors that should be created for a company to surpass the industry standard.", "Currently, the ability for a customer to create their own playlist is limited to just a few music streaming providers.", "Most are operated through pre-generated playlists based upon various factors, but are more along the lines of listening to a radio station in that songs are played randomly.", "This ties in with on demand song choices – most play songs randomly so if a listener is craving a particular song they cannot access it.", "Even selecting a playlist based off of a song does not guarantee it will be played, and the best way to listen to your favorite song is to pay to download it, but then it can only be played in playlists with other songs you had paid to own.", "Another creation that the industry should look into is the ability for users to rewind and fast forward song choices, much like one can with a song they purchase.", "If you want to get to your favorite part of a song or have a friend listen to something in particular, you currently cannot do that with any currently available platforms.", "You can click and drag to certain points in a song with Spotify, but there is no fast forward option.", "With Spotify you can create custom playlists but do not have the access to algorithm based recommendation playlists for when you are unsure of what you want to listen to or want to discover new music.", "Spotify has also created a large library of songs, ranging from unknown up and coming artists to the top artists in the music industry.", "Users are able to start a song over again or skip to the next song, but they are unable to move forward or backwards to get to a specific section of a song.", "Using the ERRC grid, it is easy to see where Spotify stands out and what it needs to focus on to become an even bigger player in the music streaming industry.", "The music streaming service industry has only been around since the late 2000s, despite the fact that from a technological standpoint it can be considered a mature industry.", "From our point of view, these younger industries tend to focus initially on doing one thing very well before they seek out blue ocans in their market.", "As indicated below by the red dot, the music streaming industry fulfills this particular place in the Buyer Utility Map we have developed.", "The current red ocean for music streaming services are focused primarily on one thing: the simplicity of use.", "Companies that offer these types of services work hard to develop a product that is easy to operate, and they do not have to adjust to any learning curve to operate the software or applications.", "It’s as easy as typing in an artist or finding a radio station, and pressing play. However, there are many companies that offer easy to use music streaming applications or devices.", "In less than a decade, the industry is beginning to become oversaturated with indistinguishable products apart from name.", "There are, however, blue oceans to expand to in the industry. We have identified potential blue oceans below, indicated by blue dots in the Buyer Utility Map.", "What if a company were to go beyond ease of use, and attempt to provide utility through convenience of delivery, convenience of use, and the fun and image associated with the use of their product?", "To offer a product that is conveniently delivered, we must consider the product to be more than the actual application or software itself, and in the music streaming industry, that final end product is also more than the music that is streaming through the service.", "The final end product is the whole experience. This can be enhanced in several ways. The delivery of the initial product, the application or software, is as simple as downloading it from an app marketplace or from the company’s website.", "However, there are also more convenient ways of streaming music to the consumer. Additionally, there are ways to go beyond offering a simple to use product by actually going above and beyond with regards to quality and effectiveness of the streaming service.", "Finally, what ways can a company make the product more fun to use, and increase interactivity with the user?", "Spotify has found ways to meet these goals and move into a blue ocean. Their expansion into these untouched segments has started to pave the way into turning Spotify into an operating system of sorts for music.", "In order to demonstrate how Spotify has made the move into a Blue Ocean, we have developed a Strategy Canvas in order to take a look at the factors that have become relevant for success in the industry – price, user base, the number of platforms the service is available on, the size of the music catalogue, the type of on-demand services provided, unlimited access, social media integration, sound quality, and offline access:", "The data for these categories were gathered from numerous sources, namely Time Magazine and Mashable (White 2013, Peckham 2014) in order to evaluate Spotify and its two largest competitors in terms of user bases, Pandora and iHeartRadio.", "Some of these categories are intrinsic to many industries, such as price, the user base, and the number of platforms.", "Others are of much more significance when it comes to music streaming services. Spotify was able to enter a market and capitalize in several key areas that are untouched by its competitors.", "Spotify’s aim is to create an entire ecosystem for consumers to enhance the fashion in which music is provided to them wherever and whenever they want it (Hagell, Brown, Gong, Wang, and Lehman 2013).", "Consumers tend to favor Pandora and iHeartRadio as music “discovery” services to learn about new artists.", "As previously mentioned, companies in this industry are initially focused on one thing: ease of use. Both Pandora and iHeartRadio function in a simplistic manner.", "But besides that, how else do they stimulate their users? Spotify has taken some of the key areas that the industry competes on and completely trumped their competitors in the areas focused on the right of the strategy map.", "In order to raise their value curves up above their competitors and to attract new customers, Spotify was able to reduce factors below the industry standard, eliminate some factors altogether, raise factors above the industry standard, and create new factors.", "In addition to generating additional revenue streams, in order for Spotify to ensure sustainability and increase profits, it will need to maintain artist and label buy in, incentive advertisers, and achieve a “lifestyle brand” status.", "Several artists have come out against streaming services because of their small royalty rates to the artists.", "Thom Yorke, of the band Radiohead removed all his songs from Spotify saying via Twitter “Make no mistake new artists you discover on #spotify will no get paid.", "mainwhile shareholders will shortly being rolling in it. Simples. [sic]” (Digital Music News, 2013). Several months after Yorke expressed his disdain for the company, Spotify released a report to explain their artists’ royalty model and how it compares to the rest of the industry.", "The transparency built trust amongst artists while providing equity to labels ensured their continuous buy in.", "Unfortunately, providing labels with equity also makes artists question just how much the music company is looking out for them rather than their bottom line, while the transparency also have investors concerned about their sustainability over the long run.", "Spotify has found creative ways to collaborate with brands to make advertising an immersive experience.", "The inclusion of music and playlists makes the user experience personal such as remixing their own created playlist to resemble a branch such as an 80s move.", "In order to maintain that relationship with the advertisers, Spotify should leverage the technology they have through their recent acquisitions of Echo Nest and Next Big Sound to provide advertisers with relevant consumer data.", "Spotify is already providing this data to artists so they can have better insights to their fans. Advertisers should also be able to use this data to target certain listeners.", "Mobile music streaming would enable advertisers to target consumers based on their location or listening habits such as playing an ad for a concert while a consumer is listening to that artist or playing an ad for an artist similar to one a consumer listens to frequently.", "While these types of ads seem obvious, anecdotally, we have heard many people complain about ads that disrupt their listening by being completely different from what they listen to frequently.", "For example, Spotify has been known to play an ad for a heavy metal band while they a user is listening to a folk band’s album.", "It is possible that at a certain user may become intimidated by the all-knowing internet, however; the small incremental changes regarding targeted advertising in addition to being able to opt out should elevate some of those issues.", "Creating this type of consistency and understanding of the customer would align with Spotify’s unofficial mission statements, from Facebook: “Music for every moment.", "Play, discover and share for free” and from Twitter: “Give people access to all the music they want all the time – in a completely legal & accessible way.”", "Visiting the Spotify website, there are people holding hands together, people laying around together, people singing along in a car together.", "People are together.

Being influential and encouraging to your users could also appear as if you have an agenda.", "Having playlists available, that are generated by your friends just as prominent as playlists generated by Spotify tastemakers should fix some of these issues.", "It will be difficult for some users not to see curated playlists as just record label agendas and additional advertising.", "In order to further capitalize on their lifestyle brand, Spotify could begin sponsoring concerts and other events that bring people “together”.", "A 2013 Neilson report shows that on-demand music streamers are 50% more likely to be heavy spenders on event tickets.", "Spotify has 40 million users likely to spend heavily on event tickets. Spotify also has the data in place to ensure that they are targeting the correct people.", "Hosting concerts and events will add yet another revenue stream for Spotify and serve as a way to be more heavily involved in user’s offline.", "While a month subscription to Spotify is only $10 a concert ticket could be $50, plus concessions, merchandise, etc.", "Spotify could use these events to create a live music streaming service in addition to its pre-recorded tracks, similar to the in-house acoustic sessions that terrestrial radio and podcasts offer but on a larger, on-demand scale.", "Since Spotify strikes deals with labels primarily, they have said that they do not want to be in the business or determining how much the artist gets paid from their label because they’re not experts in that field.", "On a similar note, they may not necessarily have the expertise in live music or in merchandise sales to be able to generate revenue and not take away from other aspects of their business model.", "They could, instead, partner with a ticketing promoter like Live Nation to facilitate events on their behalf.", "To further bridge the offline and online worlds Spotify can also sell merchandise directly through their platform.", "This feature has already become available to some artists through Spotify’s integration with BandPage.", "This adds another stream of revenue for Spotify as well as artists. “Twelve percent of musicians who earn any income from merch sales say that it makes up 16% of their total average income per year” (Thomson, 2012).", "Depending on artist’s deals with their labels, this sort of revenue could go directly to them instead of the 70% of streaming revenue that is passed along directly to the label to be dispersed to the artists.", "Giving artist further autonomy would be beneficial to the artist and could potentially be beneficial to Spotify.", "Examples of giving rights holders more options include allowing certain songs to be for premium users only, being able to have pre-listens or exclusive to select fans, such as fan club members, or allowing for listen caps, so a song can only be streamed a certain number of times before it needs to be purchased.", "This would allow rights holders to use advanced metrics to determine the way they generate demand and revenue and could encourage those weary of Spotify to buy in.", "In addition, Spotify could use the patterns of rights holders with this type of autonomy to provide insights for best practices.", "These type of practices could alienate some users that expect all their music to be free if they listen to ads but Pandora still maintains its popularity though it charges a nominal fee once you have listened to your quota of music in a month.", "Because Spotify stresses “free” and “access” so often, it could be difficult to implement even with Pandora as a business model.", "Spotify is currently in 57 countries and continuously adding new ones. “The introduction of low-cost smartphones in many emerging markets will present new opportunities to access affordable music.", "This will help global mobile music revenue to rise by a 1.5% CAGR to 2018, driven by countries such as Nigeria (21.0% CAGR), Malaysia (10.0% CAGR) and China (8.5% CAGR)” (PWC, 2013).", "Every expansion to a new market brings with is legal and cultural issues that Spotify will have to address on a case-by-case basis, however, there can be many upsides.", "Expanding to additional countries generates more revenue and can serve as a test market for new products and offerings.", "This will also provide additional locations to offer live music experiences. “While global total live music revenue will rise by a 2.7% CAGR, countries such as Brazil and Indonesia will see rises of 6.3% and 8.0%, respectively, as emerging markets increasingly establish themselves as key locations for festivals and tours” (PWC, 2013).", "Global expansion is the ultimate example of bringing people “together” and can elevate Spotify to a level that few brands achieve–being ubiquitous worldwide.", "Needless to say, we plan on being the first in line to purchase shares if and when Spotify has an IPO.", "They are dedicated to their vision of providing every type of music to every potential user in every location, and that is readily visible in all of their business choices.", "They are continually growing and entering new markets while increasing the number of apps available and social media partnerships to provide a complete experience to their users.", "They are transparent with the artists who are the backbone of the music industry and are committed to fair business practices – feats that set them apart from their industry competitors.", "With the work they are doing with

The advantage of this model is that movie and TV studios are much more willing to participate in this type of distribution (which mirrors physical movie and TV distribution and the accompanying revenues).", "As a result, these marketplaces typically provide the latest, most popular movies. In contrast, a drawback of Netflix and Amazon’s streaming services is their limited selection of popular or recent titles, as their streaming libraries are dependent on content deals they have made with individual studios.", "One of the major advantages to these digital video distribution services is their ability to personalize a customer’s experience to a degree previously not possible.", "These personalized services learn about a user’s preferences according to the movies they frequently watch.", "From this data, the company creates a profile of each customer and a list of recommended movies. If, for example, a customer liked the movie Prometheus, he or she may also like the 1979 sci-fi classic Alien, and that movie will be included in a list of suggested movies.", "Customers can refine the recommendations by rating titles according to their preferences.

The simple answer is that mechanical royalties are payments to the writer of a song whenever that song is reproduced in some form.", "But to really understand mechanical royalties, let’s take a step back to understand how mechanical royalties first came about, how they’ve changed over the years, and the different ways they can generate income.", "First, a quick refresher. Music royalties are generated for the use of a copyright. And every song has two copyrights attached to it—one for the song as written down (the composition) and one for the song as recorded (the recording).", "Songwriters earn royalties on the composition copyright, and performers earn royalties on the recording copyright.", "Mechanical royalties come from the composition copyright. Whenever an artist/record company releases the musical composition through their unique performance and sound recording (making it available to the public for profit), a mechanical license requiring payment of a mechanical royalty is owed to the music publisher and songwriter.", "The reason this is called “mechanical” is because it originates to the time when songs were “mechanically” reproduced in piano rolls and vinyl records.", "Using the term in the digital age can cause confusion, but the same “reproduction” standard applies.", "Unlike sound recording royalties, most composition royalties rates are not set by the free market. Instead mechanical royalty rates are set by government regulation through various updates to the U.S. Copyright Act.", "Back in 1909 when mechanical royalties were first created, music publishers controlled the music industry.", "Congress stepped in to regulate them via the 1909 Copyright Act and created the government regulation of a “mechanical” royalty owed to songwriters and music publishers for the reproduction and distribution of their songs.", "Traditionally, the artist/record company pays this royalty to the songwriter and music publisher for any audio reproduction and distribution of their song that they make.", "Think of the countless recordings and versions of classic holiday songs like “White Christmas” or “Let It Snow.”", "That’s big money for the songwriter and music publisher.", "For most of the 20th century, this mechanical royalty applied to physical formats like vinyl, cassettes, and CD’s.", "Today, the mechanical royalty comes in new flavors: streaming and digital downloads.

Some record contracts may also say that the advance paid to the artist by the record company includes an advance of reduced mechanical royalties via Controlled Composition.", "It all depends on the deal and the parties involved. Many publishing agreements will also require the music publisher to obtain the songwriter’s approval for any mechanical licenses paying less than 75% of the 9.1 cents.", "It’s important to note that this particular royalty reduction is virtually unenforceable for streaming royalties, because the record company isn’t paying those to the artist (the streaming services are).", "The best an artist can do with the controlled composition clause is to negotiate royalty bumps into the contract, usually tied to agreement extensions, streaming/sales numbers or recoupment status.", "Some record companies try to apply this royalty reduction to the artist’s co-writers as well.

This removal of legal liability was a big reason the major streaming services supported the MMA.", "Under this law, virtually all U.S. mechanical streaming income will flow through the MLC. The MLC will also create a centralized copyright database, making it easier to track down rights owners, as well as for interested parties to claim their “black box” royalties.", "Many of the woes that brought MMA to law were due to sloppy record keeping and incomplete registration data from rights holders and creators.", "The aim of the MLC’s centralized database is to clear up this confusion and ensure accurate/timely payments.", "Additionally, the MMA has changed the rate setting proceedings for how the CRB can consider future mechanical royalty rates.", "In the past, the judges were barred from considering other free market rates (such as what a song could earn in a TV show or movie).", "Under the new MMA law, judges will be able to consider rates under a willing-buyer, willing-seller standard.", "This means a fair-market value will be considered in future mechanical royalty rate proceedings, which has never been done before.", "The hope is that this will cause mechanical royalty rates to rise."]}

The service represents an unprecedented gamble for the company – one that’s bolstered by its acquisition of 21st Century Fox (which closed this week), but also intensified by the giant’s $85B price tag (including debt and before select divestitures).", "Furthermore, there has never been a company of Disney’s size ($60B in revenue, 200k employees worldwide) that has pivoted from a B2B business model (i.e. selling its content to Pay-TV providers, theaters, home video retailers, etc.) into a B2C one (where it sells directly to consumers).", "This transformation requires not just new skills, such as subscriber acquisition, but a fundamental reorientation of the company – from how it’s organized, to whom it hires, how it invests and which metrics it prioritizes.", "What’s more, SVOD is a notoriously difficult category to compete in; great content isn’t enough. Technology and product matter (areas that Disney has almost no experience in and has never really needed before), as does focus (which inherently disadvantages a company as diversified as Disney) and a willingness to absorb substantial losses in pursuit of long-term value.", "And as a public company, Disney will be constantly scrutinized during this pivot, with shareholders expecting the company to rapidly scale Disney+ while maintaining its multi-billion dollar dividend programming and continuing to optimize its many other businesses.", "Oh, and not only is Disney late to SVOD, but the category leader (Netflix) is essentially unbeatable over the medium term and expected to devour a substantial portion of market value.", "Despite these challenges, most have come around to at least the viability of Disney+, even if they remain lukewarm on its overall prospects or believe The House of Mouse would be better off simply licensing its content to the highest bidder.", "I’m particularly bullish on the service for nine reasons. Not all of the reasons are new, but I do think they tend to be downplayed or misunderstood.", "I also don’t particularly worry about the fact that it’ll take years for Disney to be “all in”, among other concerns.", "Reason #1: Disney’s Content is So Popular You’re Likely to Underestimate It", "In building an SVOD service, Disney’s greatest advantage and accelerant is widely understood: the company’s IP is best-in-class.", "But it’s probably (much) stronger than you think. Disney released the highest grossing movies of 2015, 2016, 2017 and 2018 (a record) – with 2019 assured due to Avengers: Endgame (the sequel to 2018’s box office champion) and Star Wars:", "Episode IX (the sequel to 2017’s).

Nine of the ten largest opening weekends in US history now belong to the House of Mouse, as does roughly 25% of the annual box office (again, a record) – even though Disney releases only 10-12 of the 700+ films released each year.", "And this dominance doesn’t factor in the acquisition of 21st Century Fox, which will add titles such as Avatar (the highest grossing film of all time, with sequels due in 2021, 2024 and 2025) and Deadpool (#9 in 2016 and 2018) to Disney’s IP stores.", "Reason #2: Unprecedented Control over SVOD Adoption and Engagement", "Disney’s vast IP stores and output also gives the company the ability to improve SVOD performance almost at will.", "If the company ever needs to shore up lagging subscriber growth (or just decides it wants the service to grow faster), it can simply conjure up a new Marvel/Star Wars/Pixar/Disney series or shift a film from a theatrical release to Disney+.", "To date, several of Disney’s live-action/animated hybrid remakes, such as Lady & The Tramp and Noelle Claus, have already been moved from Disney’s theatrical schedule in order to premiere exclusively and live indefinitely on Disney+.", "Shifting titles from the theater to SVOD may, at least in the near-term, cost Disney more in foregone revenue than it would collect on SVOD.", "But it does mean that Disney can ensure the success of its most important business unit at the flip of a switch.", "Reason #3: Billions in Pre-Existing Revenue (and Costs) to Cannibalize", "Unlike digital-era subscriptions and digital services, such as Netflix or Fortnite, Disney doesn’t need to convince consumers to make room in their life (or budgets) for Disney+.", "US home video sales of Disney content average $2.6-3.0B per year (a figure that has been flat since 2015, despite the supposed death of home video).", "This spend is equivalent to 36-42MM annual subscriptions to Disney+ at $6 per month. Put another way, Disney can become a top three SVOD in the US without asking for a single incremental dollar in consumer spend.", "And it shouldn’t be hard to redirect this consumer spend to Disney+. Few households with tolerable internet access (at least 50% of US homes based on Netflix penetration) will choose to buy a $25 Captain Marvel DVD when they could instead access the film, and dozens of others, plus an assortment of original exclusive series (some of which would feature the character), on any device at any time and for more than four months.", "Renting, too, seems senseless in the era of Disney+.", "And just as Disney can shift its feature films to SVOD, it’s likely to swap the home video and SVOD release windows in order to advantage Disney+.", "Today, Disney’s films spend four months available only by purchase or rental before they shift to SVOD (i.e. Netflix).", "Once Disney launches its own D2C service, this order is likely to swap. Disney+ will instead be the first place to watch Disney titles after the theater, with home video purchasing and rentals only offered months later.", "To this end, it’s also important to highlight that Disney only receives a fraction of a fraction of the aforementioned $3B in consumer spend.", "To point, more than half of this revenue was retained by retailers such as Best Buy or iTunes, and Disney spends hundreds of millions a year to manufacture, distribute and drive those retail sales.", "With Disney+, Disney gives up at most 15-30% of home viewing revenues by way of App Store fees (it’s more likely the company joins Netflix and Spotify in opting out of iOS and Android billing, choosing only to distribute its app through OS app stores).", "Furthermore, Disney won’t have to encounter any marginal costs per customer – no DVD, no packaging, no shipping.", "As a new category, Disney is likely to increase marketing spend for Disney+ by more than it reduces home video marketing spend.", "However, the returns from this expense should increase – rather than placing an ad to draw the consumer to a single $5 or $25 transaction, it will help to drive a recurring subscription service.", "Put more simply, the shift to SVOD nets Disney more revenue all the while offering audiences more content, with more convenience and at a lower cost to both Disney and the consumer.", "This opportunity isn’t unique to Disney, but the studio generates more revenue from home video sales of its theatrical films than any of its competitors – and thus has more to cannibalize, too.", "Another way to think about Disney+’s realizable opportunity is by considering its most likely customers.", "And there are a lot of them. The United States has nearly 20MM households with one child under 18 and another 16MM with at least two.", "Priced low enough, it’s easy to imagine Disney+ achieving substantial penetration in these homes. After all, they’re the households primarily responsible for the ~$2.8B in annual home video spend – and that’s before pricing in the value of original, exclusive Pixar series (e.g. a forthcoming Monsters, Inc. show, various Star Wars series, etc.).", "Furthermore, there are another 80MM US homes without kids – but they, per the aforementioned theatrical statistics, also tend to be obsessed with Disney content.", "Marvel, Pixar, Star Wars and Disney aren’t just for families or kids.", "This doesn’t mean Disney+ will hit Netflix-like subscriber counts (and below, I’ll say why this isn’t particularly important anyhow).", "However, it’s hard to look at this demographic breakdown, the appeal of Disney’s content across these groups, and the pre-existing spend and conclude that Disney+ will struggle to scale its offering.", "Disney+ will be undermined by the fact that Disney will lack the rights to key titles for several years after launch.", "Films such as Avengers: Infinity War or Black Panther won’t be available until late 2020, and it’s not clear if Disney will have any (let alone exclusive) access to the first nine Star Wars films (and two spinoffs) until 2024.", "And despite its purchase by Disney, 21st Century Fox’s feature films will continue to go to HBO until 2022, with that year’s releases staying on the service until 2023 and 2024 (meaning Disney+ will likely have Avatars 1 and 4 before it gets 2 and 3).", "This will make it harder for Disney+ to articulate its content offering, undermine IP-based packaging (the service won’t be the home of the Marvel Cinematic Universe for many years, even if it is the home of the Disney Vault) and UI/X (searching via “Captain America” doesn’t work if it only leads to two of his seven MCU appearances), and frustrate those who find out about these gaps only after subscribing.", "At the same time, Disney’s brand is self-evident and requires no education. Apple, Amazon, Netflix and WarnerMedia (which is also launching a corporate SVOD service at the end of 2019) each need to educate consumers on what their brands signify and sell them on their value.", "And they also suffer from inconsistent catalogue rights and missing films: WarnerMedia has the rights to the five-title Fantastic Beasts films, but NBCUniversal has the rights to all eight Harry Potter films; Netflix has The Dark Knight Trilogy, but no Batman titles before or after the trio of Christopher Nolan’s films.", "Premium cable networks such as HBO, Starz, Showtime and CBS All Access, meanwhile, remain exposed (at least when sold a la carte as SVOD services) to whatever their newest original show is – and their success in convincing audiences to stay subscribed after their favorite show has aired.", "What Disney embodies, offers and represents is not only a simply communicated value proposition – it’s one that’s adored.", "Everyone loves Disney; all the company needs to do is literally list out which films and series it’ll have and millions will understand Disney+ and want it.", "After all, a quarter of US spend on film already goes to Disney (soon to be close to 40% including Fox).", "It’s problematic that it will take years for Disney to reacquire the rights to many Marvel and Star Wars films – not to mention those of Fox (X-Men included).", "But the flip-side of this challenge is that Disney+ will automatically improve every quarter for years to come (though this also means more in foregone revenue).", "And not just in volume; Disney+ will continuously add many of the most popular and beloved titles of all time.", "The company doesn’t even need to do anything. Everyone else? They need to make great content to have great content.", "Their development pipeline is what will make them successful. And as with pharmaceutical companies, this pipeline is expensive, with long lead times and no guarantee of success.", "It’s true Disney will still need to make outstanding, direct-to-platform original exclusives. However, catalogue and recently released feature films tend to be significantly more important in SVOD than most assume.", "HBO’s film library, for example, represents 73% of total viewing across all platform and 34% on HBO Go/HBO Now.", "40% of all of HBO’s viewers watch only the network’s film content. And there’s no studio with more valuable theatrical output than Disney.", "To date, no SVOD service has scaled into the millions without using another, relatively mature business to subsidize its start and drive subscriber acquisition.", "Netflix, for example, kicked off with 7MM DVD subscribers. Amazon used its Prime subscription, HBO used its Pay-TV bundling, Crunchyroll used pirated content, Hulu used the already-monetized content of NBC, ABC and Fox, and Apple will use the fact they have some 1B active customers spanning several devices each (and the company generates so much profit from other business units it has no need to monetize its originals directly).", "Disney’s 76-year brand represents a powerful starting point, but more important is the way Disney can use its myriad consumer touchpoints and high-dollar sales to drive SVOD adoption.", "Buy a cruise or theme park pass? Free year of Disney+. $300 tote bag? Disney+. Buy a DVD or video game?", "Here’s a three-month free trial. Many will argue this move will artificially inflate subscriptions – and it will.", "But that’s the point. This approach is common in SVOD, strategically necessary, and ultimately irrelevant to the company’s long-term success.", "What’s more, Disney has always been an ecosystem company.", "Disney doesn’t need its SVOD service to be massively profitable – or even revenue maximizing. In fact, Disney has never needed this in any business units.", "The Walt Disney Company isn’t in the business of selling a video or toy. It is about selling stories and IP that capture value across every media category and countless individual SKUs.", "As such, Disney’s Average Revenue Per Family is both far more important and larger than Disney+’s Average Revenue Per Subscription.", "Accordingly, any focus on what Disney+ charges or even how many subscribers it amasses will miss the point.", "The real opportunity is how Disney+ enables and grows the rest of Disney’s businesses – from merchandise to live events, mobile games and more.", "The service will allow Disney, for the first time ever, to know exactly who interacts with their content, how frequently and in what categories, and through which characters – as well as what these subscribers buy, at which (targeted) prices and when.", "This will be Disney+’s most important achievement, and the math shows why.", "Today, the core of Disney is its film studio, which is the company’s widest reaching and most consumed channel for Disney’s IP.", "To this end, the unprecedented success of Disney’s Studio Entertainment division has driven substantial gains across the rest of the company.", "But critically, Studio Entertainment is far from being Disney’s most lucrative business unit. Disney’s Parks & Resorts business generates twice the revenue of the company’s studio and nearly 60% more in operating income.", "With Disney Cruise Line vacations costing more than $5,000 for a family of four, Disney+ need have only a marginal impact on cross-selling its subscribers to blow away the isolated lifetime value of a Disney+ subscription.", "Disney will also be able to use Disney+ to directly sell film tickets (cutting out brokers such as Fandango), reduce the share of its vacation packages that are sold by travel agencies (which also take a large cut of revenues), grow its direct-to-consumer merchandise sales (v. selling through Amazon), reduce its marketing spend via on-platform advertising and user-interest level targeting, and so on.", "Disney+ should enable Disney to increase consumption of its content, drive additional cross-upsell of its other products and experiences, and improve margins across the entirety of its non-Pay TV business.", "It can’t do this if it’s disintermediated by a third party in video. Disney+ will serve as the new heart of The Walt Disney Company and, in doing so, transform the company from one that sells one-off toys and films into one that sells a year-round service that spans all media categories, all ages and all demographics; to become Disney as a Service, if you will.", "And this has been Walt’s very dream for more than sixty years.", "Reason #9: Content Bundling (AKA Even More Revenue to Cannibalize)", "While Disney+ will initially launch as a video-centric offering, I expect it will eventually go far beyond it.", "Disney’s ESPN+, for example, also includes access to ESPN.com’s paywalled content and coverage (which, in turn, can’t be accessed without an ESPN+ subscription).", "In time, Disney+ is likely to offer add-ons for everything else Disney – from comics (e.g. Marvel Unlimited), to ebooks, mobile games, music and even discounts to Disney’s theme parks and merchandise.", "And maybe even theatrical subscriptions and tickets. To this end, analysts need to look beyond the basic question of whether Disney+ will have enough content to sustain a standalone subscription.", "Video volume matters, but so too do other features and content offerings. And notably, each additional category expands the bucket of spend that can be cannibalized.", "For all the optimism, Disney+ does face several obstacles – some economic, others cultural and strategic.", "These challenges are serious, but they tend to be over-hyped or premature. And they can certainly be overcome.", "Building an SVOD service will require Disney to pivot its existing business model and invest in substantial losses for years to come.", "Not only is this risky and expensive, it’s unclear that Disney will be successful – and even if they are, this end state might not be as valuable as Disney and its shareholders hope.", "Accordingly, many Disney skeptics argue that the company should instead continue to license its library to third parties (a virtually 100% gross margin business model that also requires no capital investment).", "Estimates here vary based on timing and the impact of the Fox acquisition, but most believe that this could generate between $2.5B in incremental profit in 2019 and as much as $5B per year by the early 2020s.", "Given Netflix has been operating its streaming service for close to 12 years and amassed more than 150MM subscriptions and $16B in revenue, but still incurs billions in annual cash losses, the argument against self-distribution is certainly fair.", "Disney is taking on material risk and has an enormously lucrative alternative.", "At the same time, there is substantially more value in owning both content production and distribution.", "To this point, Disney’s content has created far more value for Netflix over the past six years than was collected by the House of Mouse.", "This gap can be narrowed in future deals, but by definition, any licensing agreement means splitting value.", "If Disney truly is the best content creator, it should be maximizing its economic exposure to its own content.", "Furthermore, the licensing logic is isolated to the company’s video revenues. As such, it ignores the ways in which Disney can use the Disney+ platform to enhance value across the Disney ecosystem – something that isn’t possible if Disney licenses its content out to third-party services.", "This doesn’t mean Disney will be successful, but the upside is considerable. And if the company fails, it can always revert to its licensing strategy.", "Disney+ should have launched years ago. But it couldn’t. Back in 2012 and 2013, Disney entered into so many licensing deals (primarily with Netflix) that it simply lacked the content rights needed to go direct-to-the-consumer before 2019.", "While Disney has done its best to correct for these mistakes over the past few years, the consequences of this delay remain significant.", "Disney+ will be launching in a market more saturated than ever before (with the second and third largest traditional media companies also launching their corporate OTT video services within six months of Disney+), needs to spend unprecedented sums just to remain competitive, faces unprecedented fragmentation in consumer attention, and per earlier, will be forced to do so without many of its most valuable titles.", "What’s more, most believe the OTT video marketplace will support only a few players and offer exponentially less value to those in second, third, fourth and fifth place, and so on.", "This dynamic will require Disney to invest even more in Disney+ than it would have needed to in 2016, even though the odds of success have diminished.", "However, the issue of lateness is more of an issue for those whose catalogues consist mostly of substitutable commodity content.", "All things being equal, it’s not clear audiences care whether they watch Generic Cop Show X on Hulu, or Generic Cop Show Y on Netflix, or Generic Cop Show Z on WarnerMedia.", "Indeed, odds are they’d struggle to properly attribute the show’s network anyway. At the end of the day, most viewers are hiring an hour-long drama because they want to spend an hour on the couch or pass an hour on the subway.", "But audiences love and want more of their favorite franchises – especially those of Disney. Fighting to make Cop Show X or Doctor Show Y a success is very different from The Mandalorian or, say, the further adventures of Buzz and Woody.", "Not only is there significant pent-up demand for this IP, but the cultural consequence of not watching these shows is much greater.", "As a result, I’m not too worried about whether, in 2020, audiences will be able to find room for a Disney SVOD service.", "And after all, that room already exists in home video.", "There are several reasons why Netflix has been so successful to date: the early licensing mistakes of its suppliers; it’s superlative success with its first slate of Original series; the company’s focus on product and technology; and the fact it was first in and best at understanding the ways digital distribution fundamentally changed what a “TV network” could and should be.", "But the most important (or proximate) driver may be the fact Netflix needed to win. It had everything to gain from success and everything to lose from failure.", "Not only was there no emergency parachute, there was nothing holding the company back but its own conviction and execution.", "These stakes meant more than a willingness to take risks. Most importantly, it meant the simplification of its corporate mission (hence Netflix defunding its DVD business), as well as its prioritization and decision-making processes.", "In a fast-changing sector like OTT video, this simplicity matters. However, Disney will not really be “all in” on Disney+.", "At least not for the near future. Unlike Netflix, not all of Disney’s divisions – not even the content divisions – will be rallied behind SVOD.", "The theatrical window will still be prioritized, networks such as ABC, FX and Freeform will continue to receive many of the company’s most promising TV series, the company will likely continue to sell DVDs and electronic downloads/rentals (something Netflix doesn’t do), etc.", "At the same time, it’s not clear Disney needs to blow up its existing businesses yet. Linear TV is so barely watched these days among target viewers that for most subscribers, Disney XD or ABC content will feel “first run” on Disney+.", "If AMC’s Breaking Bad is widely seen as a Netflix Original because Netflix was where most viewers watched it, then the same will apply to Disney’s linear shows when airing on Disney+ (or Hulu).", "In this case, advertisers and Pay-TV providers will effectively gift Disney+ with a constantly-growing catalogue of effectively “free” (or at least heavily subsidized) content through which they can build an ad-free D2C empire.", "Netflix can’t be credited for this tailwind while Disney is critiqued.", "This same logic doesn’t apply to Disney’s theatrical films; Avengers: Endgame would have more value to Disney+ if it were exclusive to the platform then if it were first released in theaters.", "However, Disney’s approach to feature films isn’t as binary as prioritizing theatrical or SVOD. The company has already shifted several titles from the former to the latter.", "And going forward, it seems likely that films similar to 2018’s Christopher Robin and Mary Poppins Returns will be SVOD-releases, not theatrical ones.", "Furthermore, Disney will continue to use its theatrical films to launch Disney+ spinoffs. The demand for a Scarlet Witch or Loki TV series would likely be far lower were it not for the fact these characters spent years popularized via feature films such as The Avengers.", "And finally, it’s likely that the decision to fully collapse the theatrical v. SVOD release model is already in process.", "In the coming years, Disney will continually receive data on the value of direct-to-SVOD releases and shortening the wait between a theatrical release and Disney+ availability.", "And at the same time, the company’s focus on Disney+ will only grow. This will inevitably lead to a more hybridized release model – say as a three-week theatrical window for The Avengers 6 before it hits Disney+.", "But it will take time for the market and Disney+’s economics to support such a move. This will limit medium-term adoption and pricing, but it will also sustain $3B per year in operating income (more than Netflix loses).", "These profits will allow for significant additional investment and risk-taking in Disney+.", "At a macro-level, Disney’s ability to manage its existing business while enabling its newest to thrive comes down to whether one has faith in the leadership of Bob Iger.", "Disney+ represents the largest culture shift in the company’s history – and one of the biggest pivots in blue-chip history.", "But Disney and Iger have proven themselves adept at cultural adaptation – as the acquisitions of Marvel, Pixar and Lucasfilm show, not to mention the quasi-merger of Walt Disney Animation Studios with Pixar and the Disney-Fox merger.", "This doesn’t mean Disney doesn’t face serious internal challenges – managing conflicts between the SVOD and home video teams, adapting historical compensation incentives to a world where SVOD is the largest priority, making it clear that the most important functions of Disney’s past (e.g. affiliate sales) will play only a small role in its future, etc.", "But until proven otherwise, it seems imprudent to bet against Iger’s ability to manage this.", "The final prominent criticism focuses on the fact Disney plans to operate and scale both Disney+ and Hulu worldwide.", "This stems from the fact that one of the enduring lessons of the OTT video era has been that audiences actively prefer aggregation of content, rather than cable-style fragmentation of different genres and styles across different networks.", "To point, there’s no Netflix subscription for kids, just a section of Netflix with kids content (and its own UI).", "Nor is there an additional fee for nature documentaries, premium movies or anything else. There’s just Netflix.", "Disney has argued the distinctiveness of the two brands justifies the split. This is unclear. Disney+ is being positioned as a “family service” while Hulu is “general entertainment”.", "However, Disney’s feature films are, by definition, general entertainment. You can’t pull in the company’s box office results by just appealing – or even primarily appealing – to families.", "In addition, brand fragmentation will persist. Deadpool, a decidedly R-rated Marvel title, will go to Hulu – not Disney+.", "In addition, Hulu is developing a series of other all-audience Marvel titles exclusively for its service.", "This is confusing. And it’s not clear how many potential SVOD buyers aren’t being targeted by both. Similarly, Iger has argued Disney+ will have a unique character/IP-based navigational experience, but Netflix also offers a character/title-based UI.", "As such, it’s not clear you need separate services to do this.", "Operating two services also means paying to re-acquire the same customer twice, splitting or diluting programming focus (Hulu’s primary growth need might be kids content, but Disney+ might be the highest point of leverage for this type of content), redundant technology investments, partially fragmented data, added decision-making complexity (e.g. which service gets the extra $1 in investment), etc.", "In addition, many wonder why – in 2019 – Disney would rather start from zero subscribers than with Hulu’s 25MM+ subscribers (even if they use the latter to bundle Disney+).", "And for what it’s worth, Hulu doesn’t yet have the scale to generate a profit (nor does Netflix US, with 60MM subscribers for that matter).", "Disney’s library would instantly supercharge the scale of its SVOD sister.", "Ultimately, the cost of this bifurcated strategy isn’t yet clear and primarily speculative and/or based on the strategy of a single leader: Netflix.", "Certainly, I’ve yet to hear a compelling reason to believe operating both services will fundamentally erode or destroy Disney+.", "What’s more, one can just as easily generate reasons why the split may also be an aid. Hulu’s brand is 2nd or 3rd to Netflix in the United States and unknown abroad, Disney is second to none everywhere.", "And given Hulu’s diverse content library, rebranding it to a Disney derivative makes little sense. The two services may make programming decisions more complicated, but they will greatly simplify how Disney+ is used to drive the rest of the Disney ecosystem.", "This is probably more important. And at the end of the day, Hulu won’t be ready to go global for years.", "Disney+ will be available in select markets worldwide by the end of this one.", "Since its inception, Disney has been about storytelling. The primary outlet and core of these stories was theatrical films, which were distributed by a third party, and popularized IP that was repacked into other content, products and experiences… most of which were distributed by third parties and tied in barely at all.", "What makes Disney+ so significant is not the fact it shifts the business from B2B to B2C, or from linear TV to OTT.", "Instead, it’s the ways in which a direct audience relationship will change what the company makes, by whom, and to what end.", "The greatest story Disney has ever told might just be unfolding live."]}

[See my essay - The Mining of Media (or The \"Streaming Wars\" are Just a Battle)", "#6 - You Can’t Hide from a Thin Catalogue, Only Lean into It", "Although its titles are highly rewatchable, the catalogue still feels thin and it is easy to imagine that, even if consumers don’t unsubscribe (due to contracts or the low price), many will hit late Q1 and early Q2 and find they’ve little to watch and thus stop engaging.", "However, this is part of why the multi-year subscription, single SKU, and low price are so important.", "The former means that for many subscribers, it will be years until they have to decide whether to “keep” Disney+, at which point the overall catalogue will have grown and more originals will release more frequently (it also gives Disney time to fix tech + UI/X).", "And while Disney’s decision to collapse potential SVOD SKUs into a single offering is often considered at a brand-level (a single service for Disney+Pixar+Marvel+Star Wars+Nat Geo), it’s more important to consider how it collapsed segments (pre-k, kids, teens, general audiences) and formats (live-action sitcoms, animated shorts, feature films, nature documentaries).", "While different services would have unlocked a greater range in per household ARPU (i.e. some might have spent $25 per month), it also would have exacerbated churn and thinned library optics, while also complicating consumer assessments of per-service value.", "This isn’t a new lesson – this approach was Netflix’s original bet, and HBO Max is now applying the same playbook (it’s even devouring Crunchyroll, which is arguably the most successful and theoretically durable genre/niche SVOD) – but, again, it’s important to see it applies even to the most successful multi-genre/segment player.", "It’s clear that the value of Disney+ (again, the best content in the world is available at below-to-bottom-of-the-market prices) is simply so great most consumers don’t seem to care if they go a few weeks without using it.", "#7 – Success Depends on Hard Choices and Consumer Obsession That… Never Stops", "It is also important to recognize how hard and deep Disney worked to build out its catalogue. Most obviously, this meant holding off lucrative licensing deals for several years just to be able to launch in Q4 2019.", "But when Disney+’s launch catalogue was announced in September, the US service was set to include only six of the 23 titles that comprised Disney’s signature franchise:", "The Marvel Cinematic Universe. The remaining films were variously obligated to other services from several years.", "While Disney had spent years trying to buy them back, it had failed (it was successful with reclaiming Star Wars from WarnerMedia, as well as most of its Pixar films).", "As a result, it was a surprise when Disney+ launched with 16 of the 23 films. This included Avengers: Endgame, which meant Disney had broken the film’s home video release window, and every title not held by Netflix (which the company would never retrade early) or Sony/Paramount (which would have required three-to-four party agreements).", "This is clear show of customer obsession and commitment from Disney. These deals would have been incredibly expensive (Disney could probably have made several new movies instead of spending to get several year-old ones back a few years early).", "In fact, Disney probably ended up giving the licensee a profit on their original licensing fee (e.g. Disney sold it to service Y for $X, service Y used it for years but then gave it back for >$X).", "It also required Disney to be creative and flexible in how to get these deals done – to get its films back from Starz, for example, it agreed to promote the service to select customers on select occasions.", "While this doesn’t mean running commercials, it does mean bringing advertising into the service.", "It's self-evident that having more blockbuster films and a more complete Marvel Cinematic Universe improves the Disney+ offering.", "However, it’s important to understand that the value here exceeds the content itself – it’s critical to the brand messaging, for example.", "By saying “Disney+Pixar+Marvel+Star Wars”, Disney+ was benefiting from both clear and compelling branding, but also misleading customers.", "Many would have been actively upset to find out “Marvel” really meant 6 of 23 films. 16 is still problematic, but it is still tolerable.", "What’s more, consumers likely place a premium on competition – having 21 of 21 Pixar films is probably more than 5% “better” than having 20 of 21.", "We will see if other services dig as deep (WarnerMedia has long-running deals that mean many of its Harry Potter and DC films are elsewhere).", "Disney’s most expensive single licensing decision was likely The Simpson’s catalogue (probably $125-150MM+ per year).", "However, it has been enormously popular for the service – it’s often the top trending title and since launching, Disney has put up several new billboards that even add “+ The Simpsons” to its standard “Disney+Pixar+Marvel+Star Wars” logo.", "Even with the evidence of The Simpsons’ potential value (it is the longest running primetime show in US history, has more than 650 episodes, and is in the most watched SVOD genre: 22 minute sitcoms), it’s easy to imagine Disney balking at their biggest license being somewhat off-brand (literally and figuratively) – after all, it chose not to make it part of the official logo.", "However, it has doubtlessly helped “age up” the service and will ensure lots of additional (and potentially foundational) engagement for quarters (if not years) to come.", "I’m sure, given what it knows now, it’d have been willing to pay more. As I’ve written before, the value of content investments in SVOD scales exponentially – having a title with guaranteed consumption and tonnage is almost always worth it.", "Disney bought the most experienced, highest priced, and successful independent video delivery platform - and Disney+ still buckled on day one.", "And while most coverage of Disney+’s failures focused on consumer struggles to register and/or log-in, the platform’s failures were many and often very basic.", "On Disney+’s homepage, it was common to see cover art that was overlaid with text for a different title.", "In the “extras” tab for a given film, it was also common to see a thumbnail for deleted scene A, with text describing deleted scene B, but when you clicked it, you’d see deleted scene C. Disney also lacked core features such as highlighting unfinished titles on the homepage or title page in order to resume play (some of these were deliberately taken offline for launch).", "The truth is, operating global digital live services/ops business is tough. To point, Netflix, Hulu and Microsoft’s Office 365 all had full-service outages in the 15 days following Disney+’s launch.", "And yet, no one said those companies “couldn’t do tech” (which isn’t to say Netflix and YouTube don’t have substantially better video stacks than BAM).", "However, it’s critical to remember that the importance of product & technology is negatively correlated with the intentionality of viewing.", "Content spend is not created equal. The most valuable content has strong “intentionality” – consumers feel they “must” watch it specifically, they’ll add a new service to do so, and they’ll even tolerate a poor UI/X and struggles to log-in (and to fork over money) if they have to.", "Although Disney+’s original and licensed content budget is far more modest than those of the services that launched years earlier, it performs as though it is 2-3x larger due to its intentionality.", "To this same end, while Disney+ feels “thin”, this is because of the title count optics and based on adult perceptions — most adults will only watch The Irishman once (or less); a kid will watch The Incredibles 2 fifty times over.", "#11 – Ultimately, You Need to Solve a Consumer Need or Want", "Every media company wants a scaled D2C SVOD service – that’s basically a tautology. But most of the services being launched in 2019/2020 are being launched to solve an internal business need, not any unmet audience wants.", "Netflix has earned a role in its customers lives because it was first to address the core audience wants for better access, lower prices, better experiences, and so on.", "It may not need to exist today, but it solved a consumer problem at scale – and so it will exist. Hulu offered consumers a single destination for most “next day” content, plus “trailing five episodes” and really took off when it shifted its focus to being a low-cost store of deep catalogue and rerun television (with 3x more TV episodes than Netflix and Amazon combined) – much of which was never before available online (let alone in one place).", "Through its aggregation of TVOD + third party subscriptions + connected TV devices, Amazon also earned space.", "Most of the new entrants are actually creating problems so that their services can then solve them (i.e. taking content consumers already like watching on Netflix and Hulu and moving it elsewhere for a new fee and requiring a new app).", "It could be argued that this applies to Disney, too; many consumers would rather continue to watch Disney content on Netflix and without an additional fee.", "But there’s a strong case that this specific branding (Disney) with deep integration into other Disney content and experiences, plus a specialized UI, will be valued by consumers.", "It will solve a need for brand trust, brand access, and IP-based storytelling. It is the one place no parent need ever worry, and where every fan of its IP knows their love can be superserved.", "This is why it was critical for Disney to reclaim whatever content it could at any cost, and this is why the clarity of its messaging also resonated.", "Launching a new SVOD to contain “your” content, expanding an existing one so that it has more “value”, or reclaiming popular series doesn’t solve a consumer need or want."]}

He was a programmer, not an experienced executive.", "He was acquiring companies, which means whole teams, with their own hardened working habits, were slapped together.", "At one point, his company, Pure Software, acquired three companies in the span of 18 months.

He thought he could solve his company’s problems just by working harder.", "But hard work isn’t enough, and more work is never the real answer.", "To succeed as you scale, you have to leverage every person in the organization. And to do that, you have to be very intentional about how you craft the culture.", "This was exactly the lesson Reed took from Pure Software.", "HASTINGS: Well, the mistakes in Pure was that every time we had a significant error – sales call didn’t go well, bug in the code – we tried to think about it in terms of what process could we put in place to ensure that this doesn’t happen again, and thereby improving the company?", "And what we failed to understand is by dummy-proofing all the systems, that we would have a system where only dummies wanted to work there, which was exactly what happened.", "And so the average intellectual level fell, and then the market changed and we were unable to adapt to it, because we had a bunch of people who valued following the process rather than the first-principle thinking.", "HOFFMAN: Notice Reed’s double insight here. Pure Software couldn’t adapt because they had the wrong employees, and they had the wrong employees because of management decisions that explicitly selected for those employees.", "This insight catapulted Reed as he set out to build Netflix. And we’ll come back to the Netflix story in a moment.", "As we’re releasing this episode just a week after Travis Kalanick stepped down as CEO of Uber, amid a slew of controversies over the company’s culture, we thought that was worth noting.", "Reed Hastings experience at Pure Software was a relatively benign example of how company culture can go astray.", "Uber was more toxic. If you permit – or encourage – abusive, excessive or exclusionary behavior early on, it’s very hard to reverse those organizational habits.", "Our producer Dan Kedmey called Adam Grant to get his take on what happened at Uber, and what other founders could learn from it.", "Adam’s a professor at the Wharton School of Management, and author of Give and Take, and a friend. In examining the cultural collapse at Uber, Adam sees broader themes at play, beginning with the way the founders envision their role in the world:", "ADAM GRANT: I often think about people on a spectrum of givers and takers. And there’s this belief in Silicon Valley that if you want to be disruptive and you want to be sort of a CEO who drives a major innovation change then you have to be a taker.", "You look at Uber and you think, well you know they had to break all these rules, they had a fight with taxi companies, they had to, you know, sidestep laws in multiple states and countries, and you need a bunch of takers who are willing to just go in and take what they feel they deserve and what is ultimately right for their business.", "The data don’t support that story at all. It’s a giant myth. And so what you really want, if you want to drive disruption, is you want disagreeable givers.", "The people who enjoy conflict, who like to challenge the status quo and rock the boat but are motivated to do that in service of helping other people be successful or achieving a meaningful organizational goal.", "HOFFMAN: Adam’s takeaways have a lot in common with what Reed Hastings shared earlier. Great companies hinge on both the people you hire, and the culture you build to keep them.", "GRANT: I think as a founder if you’re trying to build a culture, the first thing you do is you say, “It is nice to have the right people on your bus but it is even more critical to keep the wrong people off your bus.”", "And actually Mark Chussil has a great article about this. He says we all have our “To Do” lists but we forget to make “To Don’t” lists, a list of the things that we won’t do.", "And I think that every founder should have one of these when it comes to hiring: What are the qualities that I am absolutely unwilling to let into the organization?", "DAN KEDMEY: So I’m sure we have plenty of young founders who are listening to the podcast right now. Like at what point should they start thinking about this issue?", "GRANT: Yesterday. It’s never too early to think about the culture that you’re shaping. And it’s a lot easier to shape culture through who you let in the door than through trying to radically change people’s behaviors.", "HOFFMAN: So we’ve seen two examples here of how culture can go astray. One of them, Pure Software, relatively benign.", "And one of them, Uber, rather toxic. In either case, culture sticks. And if you don’t want your company to get bogged down in corrosive or downright scandalous behavior, you have to avoid the bog to begin with.", "With the lessons of Pure Software fresh in his mind, Reed treaded carefully into the next phase of his career.", "Pure Software sold for $750 million. That gave Reed the seed money to launch Netflix in 1997. It started as a service that mailed DVDs to your door.", "And it’s easy to forget just how radically Netflix upended the video rental business from day one. No late fees.", "No extra shipping charges. Lose a DVD? Get a new one in the mail, no questions asked. Their most fearsome competitor, Blockbuster, quickly followed suit, matching service for service, but not quite fast enough.", "Blockbuster filed for bankruptcy in 2010, and shrunk from 9,000 stores at its height to roughly 10 stores today, 8 of which are reportedly in a frigid part of Alaska with sluggish internet service.", "But there’s a deeper reason Netflix was able to outmaneuver a company more than 100 times its size. It’s not a story of competition, but cooperation, a cultural flourishing that took place within Netflix’s headquarters.", "It was a culture built almost as a counterpoint to Pure Software.", "HASTINGS: We were unable to adapt to it, because we had a bunch of people who valued following the process rather than the first-principle thinking.", "HOFFMAN: A bit of background on first principle thinking – you’ll hear this expression a lot in Silicon Valley.", "First principle thinking is the idea that everything you do is underpinned by foundational beliefs – or “first principles.”", "Instead of blindly following directions, or sticking to a process, a first principle thinker will constantly ask, “What’s best for the company?", "And couldn’t we do it this other way instead?” And these are the kinds of inquisitive minds that Reed Hastings wanted to unleash on Netflix, for virtually every decision.", "HASTINGS: And so the reverse of that, which we do at Netflix, is you have to be a first principle thinker.", "There’s an overhead to that about what’s best for the company. So this is true on the broad scale, like what kind of content we do.", "It’s also true in the micro, which is, “How should I travel: Business, or coach, or by bus?”", "And we ask people to do what you would think is best for the company. We don’t give them any more guidelines than that.", "And some people that frustrates, but those are probably not the people that’s a good match for Netflix.", "And other people like this sort of first-principle thinking all the time.", "HOFFMAN: This may sound like the sort of advice a tech entrepreneur would naturally follow. Who wouldn’t want to hire a first principle thinker?", "Well, it’s easy to tell yourself that in the abstract. But when you’re running a fast-growing company, you’re also going to be telling yourself, “I desperately need a sales expert, a programmer, a designer, an accounting whiz” – and you’ll find applicants who have resumes with all of the skills suited for that moment.", "It’s all too tempting to tell yourself, “Well, we’ll find a first-principle thinker with the next hire.”", "Just look at what happened to Reed when he was at Pure Software. He’s a first-principle thinker. You’d think he’d hire other first principle thinkers.", "Game recognizes game, right? And yet he neglected that hiring standard for six years. That is why you must define your culture before you scale.", "And you have to think deeply about what cultural attributes you want to preserve at scale.", "Reed gave this a lot of thought in the founding days of Netflix. He wasn’t just looking backwards, at the lessons learned from Pure; he was also looking ahead, where he saw an enormous threat to the company.", "Forget Blockbuster, how would Netflix survive the dawn of online streaming? Broadband internet was making its way into households across the US.", "It seemed inevitable to Reed that streaming entertainment would eclipse DVDs, just as surely as the combustion engine eclipsed the horse and carriage.", "And here’s what makes Reed such a fantastic strategic thinker: He was fretting about this in the late ’90s, when broadband internet had reached fewer than 1 in 10 households.", "To comprehend why Reed hires first-principle thinkers at Netflix, you have to remember how he views these technological shifts.", "Innovations generally happen incrementally – except for those moments when everything dramatically changes.", "HASTINGS: If we continued to refine DVD-by-mail for another two decades, that would have been a failure strategy, because the underlying substrate was changing, and internet delivery was becoming possible.", "But now that we’re in internet delivery, we think that Internet television is going to be a 50 or 100-year paradigm.", "And so now our focus should shift to be, how do we do better and better on the core?", "HOFFMAN: Reed’s knowledge of history, the changing nature of technology, and the historical moment he was in, led to the understanding he would need people to change with the times.", "People who could rip up a process, and return to the first principles of delivering entertainment by any means necessary, whether it’s horseback, mail, fiber optic cable, or maybe in the future, Elon Musk’s neural lace.", "Regardless, you need people who can change the business model, fast.", "So how did Reed identify those candidates? It started with a now-legendary document at Netflix, a collection of more than 100 slides known as the “Culture Deck.”", "These slides defined exactly what the Netflix culture stands for, and who they’re trying to hire, and what they can expect.", "HASTINGS: The culture deck started about 10 years ago. So first couple of years, we were just focused on survival, then we got public in 2002, cash-flow positive", "and it was clear we were going to survive. So we then started really thinking about the culture: what we wanted to be, how we wanted to operate.", "And so over successive years, I improved this deck which I would go through with new employees. And sometimes those new employees would love it, sometimes they were like, “Oh my god, why didn’t you tell me this before I started?", "That doesn’t make sense to me.” And so we realized we should give it to every candidate.", "And so then about 2007, 2008, we did that by posting it on SlideShare. But again, it was really just to be able to send a link to the candidates.", "It’s not very pretty, it’s not very highly designed, doesn’t look like it’s an external marketing piece, but that authenticity, really, people liked in the outside world, and now it’s over 10 million views on SlideShare, and continues to be studied around the world.", "HOFFMAN: And what were the unexpected benefits of having published it?", "HASTINGS: Well the core benefit, which we did expect, was that candidates were very aware of the culture.", "The unexpected benefit was many people became candidates for us, because they loved that – what we described in terms of freedom and responsibility – that might not have otherwise thought about us.", "HOFFMAN: Here’s the fascinating thing about Netflix’s culture deck. It’s not meant to appeal to every job seeker.", "HOFFMAN: One of the things that I think that shocks people about the Netflix culture document is they say, “Look, adequate performance should get you a severance package.”", "What’s the way that you both create that high performance, but also doesn’t feel too dangerous to people?", "HASTINGS: We try to always emphasize honesty. So you can always ask your manager, “Hey, if I were leaving, how hard would you work to change my mind to stay?”", "That’s sort of the acid test, I would call it the “keeper test.” So we encourage people to check in with their manager on that.", "So we try to be very thoughtful, so it should be that there’s no surprises about that.", "And we all aspire to excellent performance, and there’s no short-term judgment, or like, “Last week you made a mistake, and so you’re out.”", "It’s not like that at all. It’s about, really, the expectation of future contribution, which is based on a range of factors and performance to date.", "HOFFMAN: This keeper test may sound a bit Darwinian. No one wants to hear a manager say, “I wouldn’t fight to keep you.", "Thanks for playing.” But I actually believe it’s more compassionate to ask this question, repeatedly.", "You have to be thoughtful about who fits in, and who clashes with their coworkers.", "Suppose a manager decides to keep a brilliant jerk on the team. Morale sags. The team’s performance drops.", "Then you have a truly Darwinian struggle on your hands. And in that sense, the keeper test cuts both ways.", "A manager can fail it as surely as any employee. That’s why a commitment to culture must pervade every decision.", "Without a clear sense of how staff should work together, it’s all too easy for managers to narrow their focus on individual players.", "And emphasizing individual performance, at the expense of the team, can be downright hazardous to an organization, as Margaret Heffernan has observed.", "HEFFERNAN: There is often a belief among very successful, very competitive people, that the thing you want to do in a company is get everybody to compete with each other.", "That if it’s “Everybody’s racing against everybody,” you’ll have this kind of white heat of brilliance and creativity.", "And I think pretty much everything about that’s wrong. And that’s not to say that I’m not competitive – I’m deeply competitive with myself, in the sense that I really want to do a better job today than I did yesterday.", "And I have seen more companies and organizations go wrong, because of what I think of as negative competitiveness: “I do want you to fail,” or, “I want your department to fail,” or, “I want your product to fail, because that will make me shine.”", "I’ve seen more damage and destruction and waste from that mentality than probably from any other misunderstanding.", "If you can build an environment in which people really want to help each other, full of people who are generous, you will do infinitely better than creating some kind of Olympic sport within the company.", "HOFFMAN: Here we come to the essence of a strong culture. It serves as a check on selfish ambition. It’s a civilizing force that excludes anyone who will drag down the team, and also welcomes anyone who elevates the team.", "In short, it’s warm but not cuddly. And if that sounds a bit paradoxical, Reed Hastings has a clarifying analogy.", "You’ll never hear him refer to his colleagues as a “family.” It’s a term that visibly grates at him. He likens Netflix instead to a sports team.", "They expect high performance from their players, and they use internal collaboration as a tool to drive external competitiveness.", "HASTINGS: In team sports that really succeed there often is a lot of warmth between the players.

I should warn everyone, I don’t know that they’re the right kind of cultural fit for us, based on the following.", "And inevitably, when you try to pull that off, inevitably, it almost never does.

And it’s brought to life by a peculiar tension between reality and aspiration: the culture you want and the culture you strive for.", "A truly strong culture is always under construction.", "HASTINGS: Yes, so it’s been updated a couple of times. We haven’t unwound anything, but we’ve constantly realized – the current issue is the deck makes us, in some cases, look cold and competitive, and actually employees experience us as very warm and collaborative.", "But that aspect doesn’t really come out in the decks. We’re constantly trying to update the deck to be more reflective of who we actually are.", "HOFFMAN: So Reed will keep revising that document, and his employees will keep reading it.

Or do you think that that is something that actually, in fact, there is a little bit of, for really successful high-performing companies, are then very congratulatory to their culture?", "HASTINGS: Well, very successful companies also work in buildings rather than tents. But that’s a generally accepted practice, that buildings work better than tents.", "So you do have to watch out for that retroactive thing, of kind of what’s different.", "But I would say, on balance, the culture will help Netflix prosper through multiple eras in a way that, say, my first company Pure Software did not.", "So we’ve encountered many challenges, which Pure Software in the 1990s would not have been able to do.", "And so I’m very personally convinced that the culture has been helping on that.", "But again, I encourage people not to believe in things, that “Culture eats strategy for lunch.” Both are really important.", "We spend a lot of time on strategy, and why not do both well? Why do you have to rank them? Let’s try to do culture well, let’s try to do strategy well.", "HOFFMAN: Think about that list of changes Netflix has weathered. The same people who shipped DVDs are now producing original content, snapping up movies at film festivals, and streaming entertainment worldwide.", "Netflix is the Madonna of companies, constantly reinventing itself. And notice how Reed, despite his strategic brilliance, is convinced that his previous company wouldn’t have made the transition.", "It’s as close as you get to a control experiment – same strategic mind, two different cultures. Only one conquers the world.", "And maybe culture is just a byproduct of strategy. Maybe you can ignore it and focus on strategy alone.", "But consider that list of threats that Reed faced, do you really want to take that risk? I wouldn’t. At the very least, if you’re thoughtful about culture, you can avoid hiring a bunch of white guys named Reed.", "Otherwise, your water cooler banter will sound like this.", "HASTINGS: Great pleasure, Reid.

A year earlier, it had been at $117; two years ago, it was at $40.", "That Netflix traded at a price-to-earnings ratio of more than 80 times its historical earnings seemed to be lost on most investors.", "But after Hastings’s missteps, the stock went into free fall, dropping to $113 per share in early October, from $210 in the second week of September.", "It would hit a low of $62 a share in November. The few—but vocal—short investors (someone who bets a stock’s price will fall and then does what he can to make that happen) and research analysts who had long felt the stock was grossly overvalued and overhyped were wallowing in Schadenfreude.", "Finally, on October 10, Hastings pulled the plug on Qwikster. The explanatory blog post was short and sweet.", "“It is clear that for many of our members two websites would make things more difficult, so we are going to keep Netflix as one place to go for streaming and DVDs,” he wrote.", "“This means no change: one website, one account, one password . . . in other words, no Qwikster.”", "And not a moment too soon. Some $12 billion of Netflix’s market capitalization had been wiped out, and some Hollywood suppliers to Netflix had begun to wonder if the company could continue to pay its bills on time.", "Wall Street’s faith in the company was shattered. People were calling for Hastings’s head. Things were looking so desperate that on November 22—after not having bothered to tap the capital markets when the stock was at or near its all-time high—Netflix raised a fresh $400 million in equity: $200 million from a longtime investor, Technology Crossover Ventures, and another $200 million from public investors at $70 a share.", "This was seen as a sign by some that the company was strapped for cash.", "The question lingers how Hastings, who sits on the boards of both Microsoft and Facebook, could have made such spectacular blunders.", "Just a year earlier, Fortune had put him on its cover as its “Businessperson of the Year.” His three appearances on Charlie Rose—in 2005, 2006, and 2011—were treated as the Second Coming.", "Had Hastings come to believe in his own invincibility? Was this a case of pride going before the fall?", "Or a failure to listen to advice? Or was this a simple failure of public relations?", "In an October 24 article in The New York Times, Hastings recalled that he had been soaking in a hot tub with a friend (Hastings lives in Santa Cruz with his wife and two teenage children, after all) when he shared with him the news that Netflix planned to separate the DVD business from the streaming business.", "“That is awful,” his friend responded. “I don’t want to deal with two accounts.” But Hastings “ignored the warning, believing that chief executives should generally discount what their friends say.”", "Now he admitted that he had been “guilty of overconfidence and of ‘moving too quickly,’” and “hubris,” even.", "The harsh reaction from his customers was due to the “angry mood of the country,” he said, citing both the Tea Party and Occupy Wall Street political movements.", "He again clarified that he did what had to be done. “We still need to move quickly in streaming,” he said.", "That same day he told investors on Netflix’s third-quarter earnings call that the decision to create Qwikster was “hard to justify” and that after the price increase “Qwikster became the symbol of Netflix not listening.”", "He reiterated that “we quickly changed course on that. And we are going to stick with DVD as part of the Netflix brand.", "And going forward we will be very aggressive on promoting streaming Netflix and the benefits, and anyone who wants to also subscribe to DVDs will be very welcome, but we are going to be pushing and promoting streaming.”", "If their critics are now legion, Hastings and Netflix retain the unequivocal support of many of the Hollywood studios, of which Netflix has become an increasingly important customer.", "“They continue to be a good partner for us,” says Philippe Dauman, the C.E.O. of Viacom. “Reed is a guy who’s smart, who takes calculated risks, and when something goes awry, he admits it, and he moves forward.", "The subscriber count is stabilized, and actually Reed mentioned that to me when I saw him recently. It’s still a great service.", "They keep acquiring more content, which makes it more valuable to their customers. In my mind they continue to have a good consumer proposition, and of course they raised some capital, so they’re on very solid ground.”", "Explains Ron Meyer, the longtime head of Universal Studios, “When you have the resources they have and the reach that they have—we’re all looking for new revenue streams—they’re the newest and most exciting, and biggest.”", "How important a customer is Netflix to Universal? “On a scale of 1 to 10, they’re a 10,” Meyer says.", "Les Moonves, the president and C.E.O. of the CBS Corporation, thinks Hastings and Ted Sarandos, 47, Netflix’s chief content officer, whose portfolio is dealing with Hollywood, are two of the smartest people in the industry.", "“Our goal as a content provider is to get paid in as many ways as we possibly can,” says Moonves. “And the reason we welcomed Netflix into the marketplace is they’re paying us in a brand-new way that opens up many horizons for the future.”", "And that future may include CBS-produced original content for Netflix, Moonves announced on a conference call this month.", "Jeffrey Katzenberg, the C.E.O. of DreamWorks Animation, is perhaps Hastings’s biggest booster, claiming that Hastings is one of the few in Silicon Valley who truly deserves being called a visionary.", "“He has shown a great sense of being able to adapt to a rapidly changing world of how people want to see movies and how they value great movie and television content being brought to them, and how their habits are changing,” he says.", "Katzenberg thinks Hastings proved to be an effective leader during the summer: “He has shown two of the most exceptional qualities of a great C.E.O. and leader, which is first recognizing how his business is transforming and being very aggressive about innovating and adapting to those changes as they’re going on.", "It’s just he, I think, moved too far ahead of the transition from hard goods to digital. There’s no question whatsoever what he was pursuing is in fact what ultimately is going to prevail.", "And the fact that he did it a beat too soon I think is the only mistake.", "“Quality number two,” Katzenberg says, “is that, having made a very bold and important and looking-into-the-future decision and then seeing that he got ahead of his customers, he did again what others find so difficult to do, which is acknowledge the mistake, fix it, and reset the business back.", "There may have been an awkwardness in the process of doing it, but those decisions were bold, smart, and imperative.", "What those short-term knocks are has just made him and the company smarter and stronger.”", "All of this praise is simply too much for Rocco Pendola, one of the most outspoken “shorts” on Netflix’s stock, who unleashed a November 28 tirade against the company on the Seeking Alpha blog.", "Pendola had been reading Haruki Murakami’s latest book, 1Q84, and he concluded that, like Aomame, the main character in the novel, “I must be living my own reality separate from [Netflix] bulls.”", "He wrote that he could not understand why, despite the separation fiasco and the near collapse of the stock, any number of publications and research analysts were still trumpeting Netflix as an investment.", "“Simply put, these moves that Reed Hastings made represent nothing more than desperate reactions to a broken business model,” he wrote.", "He then wondered why, if Netflix’s business fundamentals were so good, it had suddenly decided to raise $400 million in new equity—what another blogger called “a desperate cash grab” with absolutely horrible terms.", "Pendola called “comical” the explanation from Steve Swasey, Netflix’s V.P. of corporate communications, that, while the company had no “pressing need” for the cash, “it’s always nice to have more money than you need.”", "Concluded Pendola, “If you cannot clearly read the writing on the wall after everything that’s happened, you deserve to lose your money and average this dog down as it craters to below book value.", "Or, as Murakami stated so well: ‘If you can’t understand it without an explanation, you can’t understand it with an explanation.’”", "One of Pendola’s heroes is Tony Wible, who since 2008 has been the media-and-entertainment research analyst for Janney Montgomery Scott, a small Philadelphia-based brokerage that wouldn’t know a tarp loan if it were hit over the head with one.", "Wible could not be more different from Hastings. At 35 he is chunky and balding but with the irrepressible confidence of youth.", "Wible used to work for Citigroup—until that company almost went under during the financial crisis—and for years his cubicle was outside the office of Jack Grubman, the infamous telecom analyst who specialized in trading favorable research reports for hundreds of millions of dollars of investment-banking revenue.", "Grubman, who was paid more than $48 million between 1999 and 2001, pumped up the stock of WorldCom during the years before that telecom company imploded in an ocean of accounting shenanigans.", "“I vividly and painfully remember those days,” Wible says. “Having gone through seeing what happened with WorldCom, having seen what’s happened with other companies, I feel like you can’t fully trust management.", "You have to look at what the numbers tell you, and nobody’s going to tell you in advance if something’s not working.", "I’m sure the guys at Enron and WorldCom would have said everything’s fine. They’re never going to say they’re not fine.", "I don’t know of any management team that ever goes out proactively to say that things aren’t working or when they’re not going to work.”", "When it comes to Netflix, Wible sees red flags everywhere. On June 14 he issued a rare “sell” rating on Netflix’s stock, when it was trading at around $257 per share.", "(Only 2 percent of Janney’s research reports carry a “sell” rating, and, unlike analysts at both Goldman Sachs and Citigroup, he knows his company won’t be doing investment banking with Netflix anytime soon.)", "Wible estimated that the true value of Netflix’s stock was then $170 per share, or one-third less than where it was trading.", "Wible claimed the company was using two accounting gimmicks to prop up its profitability: not properly amortizing the cost of buying its streaming content (the value of which it was depreciating twice as slowly as that of its DVD content) and doubling the amount of time it took to pay its bills.", "Both of these, he claims, allowed Netflix to overstate the amount of cash flow it generated in 2010, when it reported $118 million in “free cash flow”; Wible figures the company really lost $12 million, and its cash flow has declined for three of the past four quarters that preceded 2012.", "The lower cash flow spells trouble, according to Wible, since Netflix is having to pay more and more for its content as well as for the increased broadband usage of its subscribers.", "The only way it can counter this double whammy is either to raise prices or to increase the number of its subscribers to 60 percent (from its current 30 percent) of homes with broadband by the first quarter of 2012, which it was unable to do.", "But higher prices were likely to result in fewer subscribers—he predicted correctly—not more.", "Wible was also bothered by the sudden resignation of Netflix C.F.O. Barry McCarthy, in December 2010, who had spent the previous year selling his Netflix stock, worth $58 million.", "And, worse, he believes, Hastings had been continuously selling his stock for several years, some $81 million worth, according to S.E.C. filings—“although we are encouraged to see that he has stopped selling stock as of early October,” says Wible.", "In December 2011, Netflix announced that Hastings’s total compensation for 2012 would be $2 million, 43 percent below his 2011 compensation of $3.5 million.", "The Netflix executives disagree with nearly every one of Wible’s arguments. According to them, Netflix is not stretching payables.", "It is not misleading anyone about its accounting.

I’ve worked very hard, but my life’s always been fun.", "It’s not been the Civil War of 1862.

Hire, reward, and tolerate only fully formed adults. She writes: “Over the years we learned that if we asked people to rely on logic and common sense instead of formal policies, most of the time we would get better results, and at lower costs.”", "If you hire carefully, 97 percent of your employees will do the right thing, but “Most companies spend endless time and money writing and enforcing HR polices to deal with problems the other 3% might cause.”", "McCord says” we tried hard to not hire those people, and we let them go if it turned out we’d made a hiring mistake.”", "2. Tell the truth about performance. Netflix eliminated formal individual performance reviews and ask managers and employees “to have conversations about performance as an organic part of their work.”", "They instituted 360-degree reviews under the theory that “people can handle anything as long as they are told the truth.”", "Netflix does not try to identify the top 10 percent or bottom 30 percent in their company; they look at the entire field of talent – inside or outside their company – and rate them in that context.", "3. Managers own the job of creating great teams. McCord notes: “We continually told managers that building a great team was their most important task.", "We didn’t measure them on whether they were excellent coaches or mentors or got their paperwork done on time.", "Great teams accomplish great work, and recruiting the right team was the top priority.”", "4. Leaders own the job of creating the company culture. McCord says that leaders need to live the values they espouse, or no one else will.", "She encourages leaders to ask themselves if there is “a mismatch between the values you’re talking up and the behaviors you’re modeling and encouraging?”", "She also says that leaders have to ensure the employees “understand the levers that drive the business” and provide context and transparency so they do.", "In addition, she says leaders need to understand the subcultures within an organization that might require different management approaches.", "5. Good talent managers think like business people and innovators first, and like HR people last. McCord also offers insights to her peers in the HR profession, noting that “Too many devote time to morale improvement initiatives.”", "She says: “Instead of cheerleading, people in my profession should think of themselves as businesspeople.", "What’s good for the company? How do we communicate that to employees? How can we help every worker understand what we mean by high performance.”", "With tenets like this in place, Netflix’s operating policies tell salaried employees to “take whatever time they felt was appropriate.”", "They have no vacation policy; employees and bosses are asked to work it out with each other. Similarly, Nexflix’s expense policy is “Act in Netflix’s best interest” – there is no elaborate travel and expense guidance.", "The theory: “if you create a clear expectation of responsible behavior, most employees will comply.”", "While this approach of “setting clear expectations and trust” may not work well broadly in a public sector context, it clearly provides some foundational ideas for how innovative leaders on the front line of their agencies can frame how they approach their job of leading and encouraging high performance.", "Graphic credit: U.S. Office of Personnel Management"]}

our children go to public schools nationwide and in California as well, and this country is ultimately one of the most successful countries in the world, we must be doing something right.”", "Even as supporters continue to pour money into charter schools, critics have succeeded in raising fundamental questions about the charter model, leading groups like the National Association for the

Rocketship and Aspire campuses, while demands for greater charter accountability and oversight have increased.", "Undeterred, Hastings and other school reform-minded tech billionaires want to inject

You’re much stronger building a distributed set of great thinkers,” he says.", "“People tend to think that they need a process for everything, and once in a while you hear ‘We’re going to dummy-proof it.’", "But if you dummy-proof the process, you only get dummies to work there,’’ Hastings says. “That’s why we’re so opposed to that and focused on giving people great freedom.", "They’ll make mistakes, of course, but you’ll get a lot of great ideas.”", "Being aggressive is good, but it can lead to mistakes.", "Netflix made a radical change in its business model in 2009, separating the mail-order business from the streaming business and charging separately, in what amounted to a rate increase of about 60%.", "Consumers hated it, the stock market hated it, and the company quickly backed off.

Publishers are pushing hard to distinguish high-quality journalism from the mass of information that is now published on the internet – and more and more of them are looking to charge for that difference.", "Some traditional brands may be helped by concerns about misinformation, which mean that people are once again paying more attention to ‘reputable’ brands– even as others continue to complain about media bias and negativity.", "There is no sign that the majority of people are about to pay for online news, although many recognise that information on the internet is often overwhelming and confusing.", "Younger audiences in particular don’t want to give up instant, frictionless (and ideally free) access to range of diverse voices and opinions.", "They don’t want to go back to how the media used to be.", "Some of the biggest brands have already shown they are able to attract a large number of paying subscribers, but the road ahead will be more challenging for other publishers.", "Loyalty and the ability to forge direct connections will be critical, as our data clearly indicate, but this will be hard to achieve just through the desktop or mobile web where news access tends to be fleeting and distracted.", "That’s why publishers are showing such interest in podcasts, longer form video, and even live events – more immersive formats that allow a brand personality to be expressed more fully while maintaining the choice and control demanded by a younger generation.", "Wider changes are also in the air as subscription-based bundled businesses like Netflix, Spotify, Amazon (and now Apple) edge into the news market.", "Even Facebook has floated the idea of a dedicated news tab where content might be paid.11 But the relationship with these subscription players is unlikely to be any easier than with existing ad-focused models we’ve been used to.", "Platforms will want to take a substantial cut in revenue in return for distribution and will ultimately own the relationship with the customer.", "Established forms of distributed discovery like search and social media continue to be important, but newer platform products and services such as private messaging, mobile aggregators, and voice systems are starting to make an impact too.", "It is a crucial question whether publishers can in fact use these new platform services in ways that are mutually beneficial and deliver sustainable returns for publishers.", "Despite the greater opportunities for paid content, it is likely that most commercial news provision will remain free at the point of use, dependent on low margin advertising, a market where big tech platforms hold most of the cards.", "This is where competition for attention will be most acute, where journalistic reputation will be most at risk, and where diversified revenue streams and smart strategies will be most critical for survival.", "A number of media companies are unlikely to make this difficult transition. Many news publishers are stuck in a vicious cycle of declining revenue and regular cost cutting – as illustrated within our country page section this year.", "We also find some governments – increasingly alarmed by market failure, especially in local news and investigative journalism – considering using public money and other measures to support public interest journalism.", "Elsewhere, we find authoritarian-minded politicians looking at the weakness of commercial media as an opportunity to capture or unduly influence the media.", "These trends continue to play out at different paces in different places with no single path to success.", "Media users all over the world continue to flock to digital websites and platforms, and engage with many kinds of journalism online and offline.", "But we are still some way from finding sustainable digital business models for most publishers.", "- https://schibsted.com/news/schibsted-will-be-divided-into-two-companies/ ↩", "- Business Insider online poll conducted by Dynata, Feb. 2019 https://www.businessinsider.com/only-a-few-publishers-will-be-able-to-sell-subscriptions-at-scale-2019-3 ↩", "- https://thenewpublishingstandard.com/scribd-nyt-subscription-deal-swedens-bookbeat-ties-bundled-deal-dagens-nyheter-storytels-rivals-challenges-ahead/ ↩", "- https://www.recode.net/2018/8/9/17671000/new-york-times-trump-subscribers-news-slower-growth ↩", "- https://www.recode.net/2018/8/9/17671000/new-york-times-trump-subscribers-news-slower-growth ↩", "- Tow Center report on mobile alerts, Dec. 2018: https://www.cjr.org/tow_center_reports/newsrooms-view-mobile-alerts-as-standalone-platform.php ↩", "- India Digital News Report, Mar. 2019: https://reutersinstitute.politics.ox.ac.uk/our-research/india-digital-news-report ↩", "- With the permission of the participants, we added tracking code to the mobile phones of around 20 young people in the US and UK so online behaviour, time spent, and specific news journeys could be measured.", "- https://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-france-protests-press/french-media-denounce-violent-yellow-vest-attacks-on-press-idUKKCN1P70J5 ↩", "- Facebook may pay publishers to put their stuff in a dedicated news section (Recode, 1 Apr. 2019) https://www.recode.net/2019/4/1/18290330/facebook-news-tab-mark-zuckerberg-license-fee-axel-springer-mathias-dopfner"]}
