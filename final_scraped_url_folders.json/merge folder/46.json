What Are the Individual's Exercise and Glycemic Goals?", "The first step in formulating a patient's exercise management plan involves identifying the patient's exercise goal, as this will influence subsequent management decisions.", "Exercise goals may include: weight loss, exercise performance, socialization and fitness. Glycemic goals in addition to hypoglycemia prevention may include, maintaining blood glucose levels in target range, or achieving a specific blood glucose level to maximize exercise performance.", "If the exercise goal is facilitating weight loss, it would be most appropriate to choose an insulin-reduction based strategy to manage blood glucose level during and after exercise so as to avoid excessive CHO intake particularly after exercise.", "If socialization and fun is the goal, then insulin dose reduction may be key to minimize time spent out of the activity to test blood glucose level and ingest CHO.", "In contrast, if the primary goal is exercise performance, then an individual may be aiming for increasing CHO intake before (e.g., CHO loading) and during exercise to maximize performance while managing their blood glucose levels so as to minimize or avoid any interruptions.", "Strategies for exercise performance may focus on matching carbohydrate intake to the specific nutritional requirement of the activity (rather than hypoglycemia prevention) and insulin doses should be increased accordingly (62).", "If fitness is the goal, and the patient has a plan to incrementally increase physical activity over time, it will be important to anticipate a reduction in total daily insulin requirement to avoid hypoglycemia as insulin sensitivity increases in response to exercise training.", "Q2. What Is the Exercise Type, Duration and Intensity?", "The next step is to consider, the type, duration and intensity of the physical activity. This will allow anticipation of the expected effect on glucose levels (24).", "As mentioned above, continuous aerobic activity performed when insulin levels are high will result in a decrease in blood glucose levels and require a reduction in insulin and/or an increase in carbohydrate supplementation to avoid hypoglycemia.", "In contrast, short duration high intensity aerobic or anaerobic activity, a pattern typical of children's natural play (80), may maintain glucose levels during exercise and even result in early post-exercise hyperglycemia (16, 81) if performed while plasma insulin is close to basal level.", "Competition-induced anticipatory stress may also raise blood glucose levels as a result of elevated catecholamine levels.", "Exercise-related hyperglycemia may require a conservative insulin correction dose (50% of usual dose) administered immediately after exercise (82).", "Alternatively, an aerobic cool-down session can be used to counteract post-exercise hyperglycemia (70).", "Since such a use of insulin or exercise as a means to oppose hyperglycemia post-exercise may increase the risk of hypoglycemia if the insulin dose or the duration of the cool-down session is excessive these strategies should be adopted only if accompanied by regular blood glucose monitoring.", "Q3. Timing of Exercise Relative to the Last Insulin Bolus Dose?", "Establishing the timing of exercise in relation to the last insulin bolus provides insight on relative insulin levels and will guide decisions on insulin adjustment, in particular if reductions should be made to basal or bolus insulin doses.", "When exercise is planned to take place within 3 h of administration of an insulin bolus (high insulin levels), then a bolus dose reduction of 25-75% can be trialed (18, 83)", "It should be noted that the smaller the insulin dose administered, the shorter its duration of action (84).", "Recommendations for bolus reduction should be relative to the duration and intensity of the exercise (24).", "Alternatively, or in combination with insulin adjustment, pre-exercise carbohydrate intake to up to 1.0–1.5 g of carbohydrate/kg ideal body weight/ hour of sustained activity (85) may be required as discussed above.", "Exercise performed when plasma insulin is close to basal levels (e.g., in the morning prior to breakfast) is less likely to result in hypoglycemia as circulating insulin levels are typically low.", "If hypoglycemia is occurring in this setting then management options include: carbohydrate consumption or reduction of basal insulin.", "Carbohydrate intake to prevent hypoglycemia when insulin levels are low is approximately 0.3-0.5 g/kg ideal body mass/hr; (47, 49).", "Reduction of basal insulin is more easily achieved for individuals on pump regimens and recommendations include a temporary basal rate reduction of 50-80% (64).", "To be effective, basal rates should ideally be reduced 60–90 min prior to the onset of activity. Other strategies to consider include use of automated basal insulin suspension functions during and after exercise, including: low glucose suspend (76) and predictive low glucose suspend technology (21).", "Late onset post exercise hypoglycemia is the phenomenon of overnight hypoglycemia particularly occurring after late afternoon exercise (38, 86).", "A basal reduction; for those on insulin pumps a basal rate reduction of 20% for 6 h (87), or for those on MDI a 20% basal dose reduction in combination with a carbohydrate snack at bedtime (25), can reduce the incidence of nocturnal hypoglycemia in response to a prior bout of afternoon exercise.", "It is helpful to ascertain if the individual engages in mostly planned or spontaneous physical activity.", "If exercise is planned, then strategies based on insulin adjustment with or without carbohydrate supplementation can be implemented (see above).", "Furthermore, exploring if planned events involve the same type of activity at the same time of day will help establish if glycemic patterns are reproducible for that individual on different occasions when conditions are similar.", "If exercise is spontaneous and pre-exercise adjustment of bolus and basal insulin are not available in advance, then the options available are limited to basal insulin reduction, carbohydrate supplementation or use of glycemia-rising high intensity exercise (67, 81).", "Q5. Have There Been any Episodes of Hypoglycemia and /or Exercise Prior to the Exercise Session?", "When reviewing the glycemic response to a period of exercise it is helpful to find out if there have been any episodes of hypoglycemia or exercise prior to the exercise event.", "Both preceding exercise (88) and hypoglycemia (89) can attenuate the counter-regulatory response to subsequent exercise thereby increasing the risk of hypoglycemia.", "The pattern and frequency of prior exercise is informative. Regular participation in aerobic activity increases insulin sensitivity and may consequently lower the total daily insulin requirement (90, 91).", "Therefore, if exercise is occurring on a day to day basis, further insulin dose reduction may be required.", "It can be challenging for health care practitioners to advise young people with T1D how to approach exercise safely.", "Clinical guidelines and a recent comprehensive consensus statement on exercise and T1D provide thorough evidence-based recommendations.", "This paper aims to facilitate the healthcare professional in applying such evidence-based recommendations to clinical practice using a structured approach to the exercise consultation based on a framework of relevant questions.", "The tools or management strategies are provided as a starting base to help clinicians work with patients and families to achieve their exercise goals.", "This framework of questions together with information from blood glucose monitoring should be re-visited at sequential consultations to allow refinement of future exercise management strategies.", "TC was responsible for the manuscript preparation.

Carbohydrates with a high glycemic Index (GI) such as glucose in liquid, tablet, and gel forms, are digested and absorbed more quickly, resulting in a rapid rise in blood glucose levels.", "In contrast, low GI foods, including fruits and wholemeal bread, are released more slowly causing a gradual and sustained rise in glycemia (55, 56).", "A meal or snack containing low GI carbohydrate 1–4 h prior to exercise can increase hepatic glycogen stores and provide sustained carbohydrate release during exercise (57, 58).", "In contrast, high GI carbohydrates are preferable immediately prior to and during prolonged exercise (59).", "High GI snacks are also recommended in early recovery (1–2 h post exercise) to replenish glycogen stores (60) and to avoid hypoglycemia in this period of heightened insulin sensitivity.", "A bedtime snack containing carbohydrate, fat and protein may help reduce the risk of hypoglycemia on nights following exercise (61).", "Clinical recommendations for carbohydrate intake will vary if the goal is hypoglycemia prevention, weight reduction, improving glycaemic control or optimal exercise performance.", "Since high carbohydrate intake is often recommended for healthy individuals without diabetes before and during prolonged exercise to optimize endurance performance (60), this strategy has recently been explored in adults with T1D (62), The authors report that increased carbohydrate supplementation, matched with increased insulin doses, is safe and allows the prevention of hypoglycemia during prolonged aerobic activity (62).", "This strategy has not been explored in the pediatric population. It is important to match insulin dose with extra CHO intake as excessive carbohydrate supplementation without matched insulin may result in hyperglycemia (63).", "Insulin adjustment, along with balanced carbohydrate intake, is a key tool for managing blood glucose levels during and after exercise.", "The degree to which blood glucose levels fall during exercise is dependent on the amount of circulating insulin (47).", "Reduction in insulin doses to prevent exercise-mediated hypoglycemia is typically required for prolonged (>30 min) moderate intensity exercise, particularly if insulin is above basal levels (18, 64).", "Options for insulin adjustment vary depending on insulin regimen.

What Are the Individual's Exercise and Glycemic Goals?", "The first step in formulating a patient's exercise management plan involves identifying the patient's exercise goal, as this will influence subsequent management decisions.", "Exercise goals may include: weight loss, exercise performance, socialization and fitness. Glycemic goals in addition to hypoglycemia prevention may include, maintaining blood glucose levels in target range, or achieving a specific blood glucose level to maximize exercise performance.", "If the exercise goal is facilitating weight loss, it would be most appropriate to choose an insulin-reduction based strategy to manage blood glucose level during and after exercise so as to avoid excessive CHO intake particularly after exercise.", "If socialization and fun is the goal, then insulin dose reduction may be key to minimize time spent out of the activity to test blood glucose level and ingest CHO.", "In contrast, if the primary goal is exercise performance, then an individual may be aiming for increasing CHO intake before (e.g., CHO loading) and during exercise to maximize performance while managing their blood glucose levels so as to minimize or avoid any interruptions.", "Strategies for exercise performance may focus on matching carbohydrate intake to the specific nutritional requirement of the activity (rather than hypoglycemia prevention) and insulin doses should be increased accordingly (62).", "If fitness is the goal, and the patient has a plan to incrementally increase physical activity over time, it will be important to anticipate a reduction in total daily insulin requirement to avoid hypoglycemia as insulin sensitivity increases in response to exercise training.", "Q2. What Is the Exercise Type, Duration and Intensity?", "The next step is to consider, the type, duration and intensity of the physical activity. This will allow anticipation of the expected effect on glucose levels (24).", "As mentioned above, continuous aerobic activity performed when insulin levels are high will result in a decrease in blood glucose levels and require a reduction in insulin and/or an increase in carbohydrate supplementation to avoid hypoglycemia.", "In contrast, short duration high intensity aerobic or anaerobic activity, a pattern typical of children's natural play (80), may maintain glucose levels during exercise and even result in early post-exercise hyperglycemia (16, 81) if performed while plasma insulin is close to basal level.", "Competition-induced anticipatory stress may also raise blood glucose levels as a result of elevated catecholamine levels.", "Exercise-related hyperglycemia may require a conservative insulin correction dose (50% of usual dose) administered immediately after exercise (82).", "Alternatively, an aerobic cool-down session can be used to counteract post-exercise hyperglycemia (70).", "Since such a use of insulin or exercise as a means to oppose hyperglycemia post-exercise may increase the risk of hypoglycemia if the insulin dose or the duration of the cool-down session is excessive these strategies should be adopted only if accompanied by regular blood glucose monitoring.", "Q3. Timing of Exercise Relative to the Last Insulin Bolus Dose?", "Establishing the timing of exercise in relation to the last insulin bolus provides insight on relative insulin levels and will guide decisions on insulin adjustment, in particular if reductions should be made to basal or bolus insulin doses.", "When exercise is planned to take place within 3 h of administration of an insulin bolus (high insulin levels), then a bolus dose reduction of 25-75% can be trialed (18, 83)", "It should be noted that the smaller the insulin dose administered, the shorter its duration of action (84).", "Recommendations for bolus reduction should be relative to the duration and intensity of the exercise (24).", "Alternatively, or in combination with insulin adjustment, pre-exercise carbohydrate intake to up to 1.0–1.5 g of carbohydrate/kg ideal body weight/ hour of sustained activity (85) may be required as discussed above.", "Exercise performed when plasma insulin is close to basal levels (e.g., in the morning prior to breakfast) is less likely to result in hypoglycemia as circulating insulin levels are typically low.", "If hypoglycemia is occurring in this setting then management options include: carbohydrate consumption or reduction of basal insulin.", "Carbohydrate intake to prevent hypoglycemia when insulin levels are low is approximately 0.3-0.5 g/kg ideal body mass/hr; (47, 49).", "Reduction of basal insulin is more easily achieved for individuals on pump regimens and recommendations include a temporary basal rate reduction of 50-80% (64).", "To be effective, basal rates should ideally be reduced 60–90 min prior to the onset of activity. Other strategies to consider include use of automated basal insulin suspension functions during and after exercise, including: low glucose suspend (76) and predictive low glucose suspend technology (21).", "Late onset post exercise hypoglycemia is the phenomenon of overnight hypoglycemia particularly occurring after late afternoon exercise (38, 86).", "A basal reduction; for those on insulin pumps a basal rate reduction of 20% for 6 h (87), or for those on MDI a 20% basal dose reduction in combination with a carbohydrate snack at bedtime (25), can reduce the incidence of nocturnal hypoglycemia in response to a prior bout of afternoon exercise.", "It is helpful to ascertain if the individual engages in mostly planned or spontaneous physical activity.", "If exercise is planned, then strategies based on insulin adjustment with or without carbohydrate supplementation can be implemented (see above).", "Furthermore, exploring if planned events involve the same type of activity at the same time of day will help establish if glycemic patterns are reproducible for that individual on different occasions when conditions are similar.", "If exercise is spontaneous and pre-exercise adjustment of bolus and basal insulin are not available in advance, then the options available are limited to basal insulin reduction, carbohydrate supplementation or use of glycemia-rising high intensity exercise (67, 81).", "Q5. Have There Been any Episodes of Hypoglycemia and /or Exercise Prior to the Exercise Session?", "When reviewing the glycemic response to a period of exercise it is helpful to find out if there have been any episodes of hypoglycemia or exercise prior to the exercise event.", "Both preceding exercise (88) and hypoglycemia (89) can attenuate the counter-regulatory response to subsequent exercise thereby increasing the risk of hypoglycemia.", "The pattern and frequency of prior exercise is informative. Regular participation in aerobic activity increases insulin sensitivity and may consequently lower the total daily insulin requirement (90, 91).", "Therefore, if exercise is occurring on a day to day basis, further insulin dose reduction may be required.", "It can be challenging for health care practitioners to advise young people with T1D how to approach exercise safely.", "Clinical guidelines and a recent comprehensive consensus statement on exercise and T1D provide thorough evidence-based recommendations.", "This paper aims to facilitate the healthcare professional in applying such evidence-based recommendations to clinical practice using a structured approach to the exercise consultation based on a framework of relevant questions.", "The tools or management strategies are provided as a starting base to help clinicians work with patients and families to achieve their exercise goals.", "This framework of questions together with information from blood glucose monitoring should be re-visited at sequential consultations to allow refinement of future exercise management strategies.", "TC was responsible for the manuscript preparation.

However, the company's 10Q filing with the SEC mentions a \"net cash outflow of $11.3 million related to an acquisition,\" which is presumably the price paid for TypeZero.", "\"We are thrilled to welcome TypeZero Technologies to the Dexcom family, following our acquisition of the company in August,\" Dexcom EVP of Strategy and Corporate Development Steve Pacelli said on the call.", "\"The team and the company's technology align well with our strategy. Specifically, the inControl closed-loop algorithm provides Dexcom with ... another critical component in an automated delivery system.", "We look forward to first bringing it to market with our San Diego neighbors, Tandem Diabetes. In addition, TypeZero will advance our decision support roadmap, which supports both our core intensive business and other non-intensive programs.", "The TypeZero acquisition was catalyzed in part by the FDA's iCGM classification for G6, which we believe will help bring a greater number of insulin delivery solutions integrated with Dexcom's CGM platform to market over the next couple of years.\"", "Pacelli also mentioned the two recent FDA clearances during the call. One clearance was fairly straightforward: it allows for a version of Dexcom's new G6 sensor that's compatible with an Android app and doesn't require a dedicated receiver.", "The other is more interesting — a professional, disposable version of Dexcom's CGM that doesn't transmit data in real time, but instead stores it to be read later by a healthcare professional.", "\"Beyond our core insulin business, we continue to explore new market opportunities that will expand Dexcom's long-term growth profile,\" Pacelli said.", "\"For example, many of you saw the recent 510(k) clearances we received for devices supporting our development efforts outside of our intensive business.", "The first clearance relates to a software application based on our core G6 sensor and algorithms and had certain features that are tailored to people with diabetes in the non-intensive population.", "And the second is a fully-disposable glucose recording device indicated for all people two-years and older, not exclusively people with diabetes.", "We believe this product is the first step in making CGM a valuable diagnostic tool across all of healthcare.\"", "Of course, in addition to these new items, Dexcom's main order of business on the call was to report postive earnings numbers stemming from the launch of the G6 in June.", "The company saw worldwide revenue of $266.7 million over the quarter, compared to $184.6 million for in Q3 2017, a 44 percent growth.", "Revenue continues to grow considerably more quickly than expenses.", "\"To give you some perspective, our US commercial new patient pipeline has more than doubled as compared to this time last year, and our Medicare business continues to build nicely.", "Our [outside-the-US] business grew faster this quarter than in any period over the last five years,\" CEO Kevin Sayer said.", "\"... The G6 system is already available in 14 countries and we will continue to roll that globally in 2019.", "As part of our plans, we recently announced that CMS has approved G6 and we intend to bring this great technology to our Medicare-eligible customers in early 2019.\""]}

(2) and Lu et al. (3), no outcomes-based evidence to support the use of TIR existed.", "A primary conclusion drawn in the study by Beck et al., and one we agree with, is that “TIR is strongly associated with risk of microvascular complications” and therefore it should be accepted as an end point for clinical investigations (2,3).", "Furthermore, TIR has added value beyond the accepted gold standard of A1C. Discussing how the authors arrived at this conclusion and how it fits in the current framework of diabetes management requires us to first provide some historical context.", "A1C was discovered in 1968 and it began to be used for clinical care in the early 1980s (8). As performance of the test improved, clinical uptake was relatively quick, and by the end of the 1980s use of this objective measurement of glycemic control was standard of care; in fact, routine measurement of A1C was part of the first American Diabetes Association “Standards of Care” published in 1989 (9).", "Conduct of the DCCT was feasible, in part, because of the ability to conduct home blood glucose monitoring, measure A1C levels, and utilize insulin pump therapy as a means to intensify the insulin regimen.", "In recognition of the limitations of A1C measurements, individuals with hemoglobinopathies, as well as those with renal and liver disease, were excluded from study participation.", "Despite the fact that investigators at the time cautioned it was not an “A1C study” but rather a study on the effectiveness of two therapies (standard vs. experimental intensive insulin therapy), the DCCT and many other studies have been interpreted as exactly that: the goal of diabetes therapy is to improve the A1C to a certain number, depending on the clinical situation.", "To this day, A1C targets are based on the interpretation of the DCCT in T1D and the UK Prospective Diabetes Study (UKPDS) in T2D (10).", "Even in the 1980s, it was recognized that many clinical situations could result in falsely low (and occasionally falsely high)", "A1C levels (11).

CGM glucometrics have evolved beyond assessing means and variability statistics, and both patients and providers agree that use of TIR as a primary metric for diabetes control is essential as it is easily understood by all involved in care and provides guidance on where efforts should be focused (i.e., reduction of hyperglycemia or avoidance of hypoglycemia).", "For clinical care, knowing the TIR (including time above and below range) gives a global assessment of control, but to better understand where there may be greater hyperglycemia, hypoglycemia, or variability, assessment of an ambulatory glucose profile is needed.", "Furthermore, given the limitations of A1C, the question is whether it is possible to use CGM data as an alternate metric for individuals, as this can then be used as an end point for clinical trials, including those used for regulatory purposes.", "Up until now, the greatest challenge with CGM data was that there were no studies correlating TIR and microvascular complications.", "For the DCCT with the quarterly seven-point capillary glucose profiles from all 1,440 patients over the course of the 6+ years of the study, the question of the association between TIR and development of microvascular complications could be explored.", "The conclusions are what many have been awaiting since we started using CGM, yet the actual TIR may be surprising to some given how well we can manage diabetes today; the intensive therapy group only had a TIR of 52%, while the standard group had a TIR of 31%.", "TIR was substantially lower in those who developed microvascular complications compared with those who did not.", "In fact, for the outcome of retinopathy, TIR was ∼12% lower, while for those with microalbuminuria there was a ∼10% lower TIR.", "The difference in TIR between people developing and not developing eye or kidney disease equates to about 2.5 h each day.", "While these findings are provocative, it is important to note that use of CGM could have produced even more striking results.", "As sensor glucose values are measured every 5–15 min, depending on the sensor, there is a 40-fold increase in the data collected with CGM as compared with the seven-point measurements available for this analysis.", "However, prior publications have demonstrated similar TIR assessment when comparing data from CGM and blood glucose meters (15,16).", "One theoretical concern is that as participants in the DCCT conducted seven-point measurements only every 3 months, it is possible that on the days when increased monitoring was required, participants were more diligent with their diabetes management.", "After the DCCT was completed, the observational Epidemiology of Diabetes Interventions and Complications (EDIC) study continued reporting outcomes.", "It is noteworthy that despite A1C levels being the same in the two treatment groups for 18 years of follow-up in EDIC, “metabolic memory” during this time interval resulted in the experimental group developing less retinopathy (17).", "Additionally, after a mean of 27 years in both the DCCT and EDIC studies, less cardiovascular disease and all-cause mortality were noted (18).", "The obvious question is whether TIR from the seven-point glucose profiles can be extrapolated to the EDIC findings.", "Since the TIR from the intervention in the DCCT predicted DCCT outcomes, and there was no other intervention in EDIC, we believe the study by Beck et al.", "(2) can be extrapolated to this concept of metabolic memory, even though the molecular mechanisms are not completely understood.", "Furthermore, although it had a different design, the study by Lu et al. (3) in individuals with T2D is consistent with the hypothesis that glucose, and more specifically TIR, is also predictive of diabetic retinopathy in T2D.", "Once the DCCT proved the intimate relationship between the intensification of insulin regimen leading to more targeted glycemic control and delayed onset and progression of microvascular complications, efforts were focused on incorporating this tool into clinical practice.", "Although investigators were already using this measurement as a primary outcome for clinical trials, its clinical application took time.", "What was necessary at the time was to educate and train diabetes care and primary care practitioners on the benefits of knowing the A1C of a person with diabetes seen in their clinic.", "Direct-to-consumer public service announcements to “know your A1C” also became widespread.", "We believe that along with A1C, the present analysis provides the evidence that TIR should be accepted as a primary outcome for future clinical investigations.", "We encourage the conduct of a confirmatory prospective observational study assessing TIR and microvascular complications.", "Indeed, longitudinal registry data could be used to answer these questions. The real question for researchers and clinicians is how much more data are required on use of the TIR end point for patient care, study outcomes, and regulatory decisions.", "Certainly, it would be interesting to see how the DCCT TIR data predict the results from the follow-up EDIC study.", "However, it is also critical to understand the current landscape of diabetes management that includes not just technological advancements but also alterations in screening and treatment for comorbid conditions, including stricter blood pressure and lipid targets and routine use of ACE inhibitors and statins, for example.", "Indeed, the impact of TIR in the current era may have different implications than what was observed with the DCCT findings; however, we would maintain the same could be said for A1C.", "Given the known problems with A1C, which is a biomarker of glucose, we believe it is appropriate to use TIR as a valid end point given the clear toxicity of chronic hyperglycemia (19).", "It is also important to note that TIR can inform providers and patients where efforts should be focused to help individualize a patient’s diabetes care plan, in hopes of minimizing microvascular complications.", "In an era of personalized medicine, tracking an individual’s progress in regard to TIR achieved allows for realistic goals to be developed in conjunction with providers.", "Unlike for A1C measurements, it will be easier for all diabetes care providers, including those in primary care, to convey this information and educate patients.", "With the advent of ambulatory glucose profile reports, people with diabetes can quickly garner from interpretation of their current data where changes need to be made and why certain dose adjustments may assist in achieving glycemic goals (20).", "No longer are we left to connect the dots of intermittent blood glucose monitoring to build a story about risk of microvascular complications; we can see the issues from every angle.", "While to some it may seem like A1C is “outdated,” we would maintain that this biomarker should continue to be used as a tool for both clinical care and research.", "A1C has a proven track record but provides different information than TIR, thus a combined outcome for these two metrics seems justified.", "In addition, particularly for clinical care, it is not realistic to assume CGM will become so popular that there would not be a need for A1C.", "What the article by Beck et al. (2) provides is a call to action. Our job will be to inform all our colleagues of the benefits of assessing TIR, educate those who are unfamiliar with it, and provide the tools necessary to people with diabetes.", "Regulators will need to rethink the end points chosen in conjunction with investigators for clinical trials.", "Insurers may find these data assist them in allowing for coverage of such devices; after all, if we can minimize long-term microvascular complications, that should be of benefit.", "Advocacy groups who have worked tirelessly to assure no person with type 1 diabetes is denied use of CGM will have their argument strengthened by these data.", "Finally, device manufacturers will need to continue to innovate CGM technology, making the duration of wear longer, ensuring the footprint of the device is smaller, and finding clear and compelling ways to make the data collected easily interpretable.", "At the conclusion of the DCCT, members of the Joslin Clinic wore buttons stating “I told you so. —E.P. Joslin” (21).", "For many it comes as no surprise that lower TIR has now been associated with microvascular complications.", "In the midst of this technological revolution, embracing CGM metrics for both trials and treatment makes sense.", "Duality of Interest.

(DXCM -0.54%) is a medical device company that pioneered the development of continuous glucose monitors (CGM) used by diabetics to more accurately track their blood glucose levels and control their disease.", "Founded in 1999, DexCom competes against industry titans Medtronic (MDT 1.06%) and Abbott Labs (ABT -0.38%) in an addressable market that totals more than 30 million diabetics in the United States alone.", "Given there are 1.5 million new cases of diabetes diagnosed every year in America, and the number of people with diabetes is expected to eclipse 50 million by 2030, does DexCom deserve to be a top stock for growth investors to buy?", "When functioning normally, the pancreas releases insulin after we eat to convert glucose into stored energy.", "However, in patients with diabetes, the pancreas either doesn't produce any or enough insulin (type 1 diabetes) or the body has developed a resistance to the insulin it produces (type 2 diabetes).", "Resulting from genetic or environmental factors, type 1 diabetes is typically diagnosed in childhood or in adolescence.", "A lifelong disease, type 1 diabetes requires chronic blood glucose monitoring and regular insulin dosing to prevent the buildup of blood sugar that can lead to a series of health problems.", "Type 2 diabetes is usually diagnosed later in life than type 1 and while the cause of type 2 diabetes isn't fully understood, a person's genetics and lifestyle are considered contributing factors to developing insulin resistance.", "The most common type of diabetes, type 2 diabetes accounts for about 95% of diabetes patients. While type 2 patients don't have as intensive of a regimen for monitoring their blood sugar, these patients often progress to requiring insulin and ongoing analysis of blood sugar levels is critical.", "Absent adequate monitoring and the correct use of insulin, diabetes patients are at risk of developing a variety of health problems, including nerve damage that can lead to amputation, vision loss that can lead to blindness, and life-threatening kidney disease and cardiovascular disease.", "According to the World Health Organization (WHO), adults with diabetes have a two- to threefold higher risk of heart attack and stroke than their nondiabetic peers.", "Diabetes is the seventh leading cause of death and overall, the average life expectancy of someone with diabetes at age 50 is reduced by nearly nine years.", "There are 30.3 million Americans living with diabetes in America, according to the Centers for Disease Control (CDC), and globally, the addressable patient population eclipses 422 million, up from 108 million in 1980, according to WHO.", "The number of people with diabetes is expected to increase substantially over the coming decade, and as a result, the total costs associated with treating it is forecast to skyrocket.", "Research from the Institute for Alternative Futures (IAF) concludes that the number of people with diagnosed or undiagnosed diabetes in the U.S. will reach 54.9 million by 2030 and that spending on diabetes will increase to $622 billion in 2030 from $408 billion in 2015.", "Medications, including metformin, are widely used to help keep blood glucose levels from causing life-threatening problems in type 2 patients, but the most critical component of keeping diabetes in check for type 1 patients is accurate monitoring and insulin dosing to avoid dangerously high (hyperglycemia) or low (hypoglycemia) levels of blood sugar.", "Usually, type 1 and type 2 diabetes patients evaluate their blood sugar levels by using finger sticks to collect a small blood sample that can be analyzed by a glucose meter.", "Because type 1 diabetics produce very little or no insulin, they undergo this routine four to 10 times per day, including prior to eating, before and after exercising, and before falling asleep.", "Regular checks of blood sugar during the night aren't uncommon, either. Type 2 diabetics don't require as intensive of monitoring but they still check their blood sugar levels often, including around mealtimes.", "Despite regularly checking blood sugar with finger sticks, studies show most diabetes patients spend 70% of every day outside of the healthy range for blood sugar, and as a result, are at a greater risk of diabetes causing life-threatening problems.", "Recognizing that finger sticks and glucose metering fall short for many people, DexCom was founded in 1999 with a singular mission: to develop medical devices that continuously monitor blood glucose levels so that patients can better determine when they should be taking their insulin.", "Until 2003, DexCom's research focused primarily on developing implantable sensors that could remain in the body for an extended time.", "But in 2004, growing concern that the company would face challenges gaining approval for a long-term implant solution that was more invasive and costly than traditional finger sticks, led to the development of short-term, temporary sensors that can be attached to the skin.", "In 2005, DexCom raised $56.4 million in an IPO on the Nasdaq to fund clinical trials of its short- and long-term system.", "The short-term sensor and CGM solution -- the STS continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) system -- won FDA approval in 2006 after trials demonstrated patients spent less time outside a normal healthy blood sugar range while using it.", "The long-term implant solution, however, was halted after the company \"evaluated several months of data from feasibility studies\" and determined the product \"didn't warrant investing in a large pivotal trial.\"", "In short, creating a reliable long-term device that would pass muster with regulators, payers, and patients was too difficult a challenge to overcome, particularly given the successful launch of the short-term sensor solution, which was a revolutionary advance in its own right.", "The short-term STS system used tiny wire-like sensors that were inserted by the patient just under the skin that could be worn for three days.", "Data collected by these sensors was reported wirelessly to the STS receiver, where it was charted and displayed in a graph to patients.", "To help patients know when their blood glucose levels were too high or too low, the STS system also included a feature that triggered alerts.", "The company's second-generation product, the seven-day STS CGM system, got the FDA's nod in 2007. That system increased the time sensors could be worn by diabetics from three to seven days and it included a feature that allowed patients to download their glucose level data to a computer for review.", "These early systems provided revolutionary insight to patients but didn't begin to gain widespread adoption until 2008, when results from a Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation trial were unveiled.", "In its 322-person trial, CGMs significantly improved glucose control without hypoglycemia. The study was important because it reduced worry that the use of CGM's could cause patients to take too much insulin.", "Thanks in part to a growing body of evidence supporting the use of CGMs, DexCom's sales began to accelerate.", "In 2008, sales climbed 76% to $8.1 million and by 2011, sales were topping $40 million. The rapid run-up in sales allowed DexCom to plow more money into research and development, and that spending led to the development of its next generation of CGMs, the G-series.", "The company's first G-series CGM was the G4 Platinum, which won FDA approval in 2012. The G4 was smaller than the STS systems preceding it, and it improved hypoglycemic accuracy by 30%.", "The improvement in accuracy is important because CGM's don't measure glucose levels through the bloodstream.", "Instead, they do so through the interstitium, a fluid-filled space just under the skin. Because CGM sensors are inserted into the interstitium, the CGM's software contains code that deduces actual blood sugar levels from the sensor readings at points in time.", "Absent greater accuracy, patients were still at risk of taking too much insulin, which can cause hypoglycemia.", "The G4 also offered a longer transmission range between its sensors and the receiver and a more user-friendly color LCD display than previous devices.", "In 2015, DexCom followed up the G4 with the G5. The G5 allowed patients to see real-time data on either a DexCom receiver or on any compatible device, including smartphones, via an app.", "The G5 also included an option to securely share real-time data with a caregiver, such as a parent, and it provided access to a cloud-based repository where data could be stored for review.", "Importantly, the G5 was the first DexCom CGM to do away with the need to confirm CGM readings with finger sticks prior to taking insulin.", "Although finger sticks were still necessary every 12 hours to calibrate the system, the advance significantly reduced the burden of finger sticks on patients.", "Ongoing technological advances, such as the G4 and G5, alongside growing acceptance of CGMs generally, has been a boon to the company's top line.", "Since 2008, DexCom's annual sales have increased from less than $10 million to $718.5 million in 2017 -- a compounded annual growth of nearly 57%.", "DexCom isn't the only company profiting from continuous glucose monitoring systems.", "Medtronic and Abbott Labs are deep-pocketed foes and each has recently launched compelling new devices for diabetes that challenge DexCom.", "After securing an unexpected early approval in 2016, Medtronic launched its MiniMed 670G in 2017. The MiniMed 670G is the world's first closed-loop monitoring and insulin dosing system to win the regulatory green light.", "It combines Medtronic's Guardian CGM and Medtronic's insulin pump in a system that automatically measures blood glucose levels every five minutes and then, automatically doses insulin when it's necessary.", "The MiniMed 670G marks a major advance in treating diabetics requiring extensive monitoring and so far, it's a hit.", "In Medtronic's 2018 fiscal fourth quarter, diabetes revenue rose 26% to $645 million because of the system.", "Abbott Labs is also riding a wave of growing demand following the approval of its latest CGM, the Freestyle Libre.", "When the Freestyle Libre won FDA approval in 2017, it became the first CGM approved that didn't require daily finger sticks for calibration.", "The device's sensors do have a 12-hour warm-up period in which data isn't recorded, however, so finger sticks are necessary during that period.", "The Freestyle Libre launched at a lower price point than DexCom's G5 and since it eliminated the need for finger sticks for calibration, it's become a commercial success.", "As of March 2018, 650,000 patients were using the Freestyle Libre and 50,000 new patients were being added monthly.", "Abbott hasn't said specifically how much money the Freestyle Libre's contributing to its top-line, but it has said that it was responsible for a 30% increase in its diabetes revenue in Q1 2018.", "Abbott Labs reports its diabetes sales in its \"other\" category and in Q1 2018, \"other\" revenue accounted for $430 million of Abbott Labs $7.4 billion in total sales.", "As you can see in the following chart, the 2017 approval of Abbott's Freestyle Libre took a toll on DexCom's share price.", "However, the sell-off proved temporary as the company's shares rallied sharply following the FDA approval of DexCom's latest CGM, the G6, in March 2018.", "The G6 is arguably more feature-rich than the Freestyle Libre. Like the Freestyle Libre, DexCom's G6 eliminates the need for finger sticks, but unlike Abbott Labs' CGM, the G6's sensors only have a two-hour warm-up period.", "The G6 automatically communicates data between its sensors and a receiver and the receiver can be a smartphone or similar device, too.", "Alternatively, Abbott's receiver has to be held within 1.5 inches of its sensors to transfer data and there's no app yet that allows patients to use a smartphone or tablet as the receiver.", "Furthermore, the G6 warns patients of dangerous glucose readings with an alarm, while the Freestyle Libre doesn't.", "The G6 system uses smaller sensors than DexCom's G5 and its sensors can be applied to the skin with a new one-touch applicator that's easier to use.", "Additionally, the G6's sensors can be worn for 10 days while the G5 sensors are only approved for seven days of use.", "G6's features could help DexCom outcompete the Freestyle Libre, but what's most exciting about the G6 is that it's the first CGM to win FDA approval as a stand-alone system or as a CGM for use in automated insulin dosing systems.", "Currently, Medtronic is the only company marketing a closed-loop monitoring and insulin dosing system (the aforementioned MiniMed 670G), but insulin pump makers Insulet (PODD 1.08%) and Tandem Diabetes (TNDM -6.34%) are working on their own closed-loop systems and those systems are being designed for use with DexCom's CGMs.", "Studies for a system that pairs up the G5 with Insulet's Omnipod insulin pump are underway, and according to management, its closed-loop system could reach the market as soon as late 2019.", "Meanwhile, Tandem Diabetes is even closer to the finish line. Its t:slim X2 insulin pump is the only pump approved for use with DexCom's G5 that doesn't require finger sticks prior to dosing insulin, and Tandem says an FDA approval of a closed-loop system using the G5 could come as soon as the summer of 2018.", "An OK for a system that incorporates the G6 could be available by the end of 2018 or early 2019, too.", "The potential associated with DexCom's G6 isn't limited to those two solutions, though. DexCom is looking at pairing it up with other solutions, such as smart insulin pens or apps, too.", "DexCom's innovation isn't going to stop with the G6, either. The company's working closely with Alphabet (GOOG 1.62%) (GOOGL 1.60%)", "healthcare spinoff Verily on disposable CGM solutions that could find their way to the market in 2020.", "DexCom is at the forefront of CGM technology and its strategy of working with any insulin delivery system could help it win more market share over time.", "The company isn't profitable yet, though, and there's no guarantee its sales will reach the levels necessary to produce consistent earnings.", "Nevertheless, the sheer size of the addressable market for diabetes medical devices and a single-digit penetration rate for CGMs in that market suggest there's plenty of potential for revenue to climb high enough for DexCom to eventually reward shareholders with profits.", "Undeniably, DexCom's got heavyweight competition from Medtronic and Abbott Labs, but unlike those companies, it's a pure player in this market.", "If CGMs become a standard used alongside insulin delivery to treat diabetes patients, then its investors could benefit substantially."]}

Several metrics can be computed over these differences, such as %20/20-ISO boundaries, absolute relative difference, and mean absolute relative difference (MARD)", "[10].

From 2010 to 2012, only 7% of the T1D Exchange Registry participants were using CGM sensors [37].", "A recent study reported that the most common barriers to CGM use were related to the high cost of the device, lack of insurance coverage, the hassle of wearing devices and the dislike of having devices on the body; the most common reasons for stopping CGM were cost, alarm fatigue and perceived sensor inaccuracy [38].", "Nowadays, thanks to the recent developments in CGM technology, in particular the release of new more accurate sensors with reduced sensor size and calibration requirements, most of these barriers have been overcome.", "After the regulatory approval of CGM therapeutic use, the United States medical insurance company Medicare has announced reimbursement criteria for therapeutic CGM devices to all T1DM and T2DM patients on intensive insulin treatment [39].", "Similarly, in many European countries CGM expenses are now covered by national healthcare systems, thus increasing the accessibility of such technology.", "These changes has led to a growth of CGM use both in United States and in Europe. Most recent data from the T1D Exchange Registry reported that about 30% of participants have been using CGM in the period from 2016 to 2018", "[40].

Currently, only a small portion of well-trained T1DM individuals is using CGM, which represents less than 0.5% of the global diabetic population [43].", "A possible reason for the low global uptake of CGM is that there are weak evidences that CGM is beneficial for T2DM patients not on intensive insulin treatment, which actually represent the majority of the diabetic population.", "Standards of diabetes care, like the American Diabetes Association and the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists and American College of Endocrinology, recommend CGM use in conjunction with intensive insulin treatment for T1DM subjects who do not meet the glycemic target or suffer from hypoglycemia unawareness", "[44,45].

[51] and Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation Continuous Glucose Monitoring Study Group et al.", "[5] considered T1DM individuals undergoing both MDI and CSII therapies and assessed the ability of several CGM sensors in improving the glucose control.", "In particular, both studies showed a significant reduction of HbA1c of 0.64% and 0.53%, respectively, in subjects adopting CGM versus a control group employing standard therapy based on SMBGs.", "Moreover, both studies confirmed a direct relationship between sensor usage time and average HbA1c reduction.", "Specifically, Bergenstal et al. [51] showed that significant HbA1c reduction was possible only for users using CGM sensor between 41% and 60% of the time, which doubled in users who used CGM more than 80% of the time.", "Consistently, Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation Continuous Glucose Monitoring Study Group et al.

Indeed, thanks to its intrinsically superior time resolution, CGM enables users to capture glycemic fluctuations that are invisible using SMBG only.", "The real-time availability of glucose concentration values as well as visual/acoustic hypoglycemic alerts allow users to act in order to mitigate, or even avoid, hypoglycemia.", "In a recent multicenter clinical study involving T1DM subjects having good starting glucose control, a 50% reduction of time spent in hypoglycemia has been shown, even if no significant reduction of HbA1c was reported [52].", "Another study by Haak et al. [53] analyzed the impact of CGM use on individuals affected by T2DM in free-living conditions under either MDI or CSII therapy.", "Results showed a significant reduction of hypoglycemia of 53%. However, no significant reduction of HbA1c has been observed although the study participants were poorly controlled T2DM subjects.", "The reason behind this result probably lies behind the lack of optimal education from the patients. To support this thesis, according to a recent study by Hermanns et al.", "[54], the usage of FGM was effective to reduce HbA1c in participants receiving proper structured education, but FGM itself without education was not effective in poorly controlled T1DM and T2DM under MDI therapy.", "Summarizing, thanks to the adoption of CGM in diabetes treatment, hypoglycemia can be successfully mitigated both improving individuals' quality of life and reducing the shortcoming of dangerous short-term complications.", "Several studies appear to confirm that glycemic variability can play a key-role in the appearance of vascular damages [29] and in the set-up of hypoglycemic events [55].", "CGM sensors are important also in reducing glycemic variability in individuals affected by diabetes. In Jamiolkowska et al.", "[56], 40 subjects aged 14.6 years have been recruited to evaluate whether the use of CGM could improve glycemic variability in terms of glucose standard deviation (SD) and area under the curve (AUC).", "Results showed a reduction of SD from 60.7 to 51.7 mg/dL as well as a decreasing of AUC with threshold fixed at 140 mg/dL from 41.2% of the control group to 21.2% of the group that accepted the adoption of CGM use.", "Another study from Tumminia et al.

Participants were monitored for 6 months while being randomized into two groups to compare SMBG versus CGM in terms of SD of the glucose profile and range of glycemic excursions (RGEs).", "Results showed a reduction of both SD and RGE when using CGM compared to SMBG (62.3 mg/dL vs. 75.5 mg/dL and 132.3 mg/dL vs. 175.3 mg/dL, respectively).", "In summary, the use of CGM was shown to be crucial to allow people affected by diabetes reducing glycemic variability.", "As a result, this unlocks the possibility of mitigating the shortcoming of both hypo and hyperglycemia as well as dangerous micro/macrovascular complications.", "The increased amount of available information brought by wearable devices, such as CGM systems and physical activity monitoring bands, has led to the development of decision-making tools and applications that can enhance the management of the disease [58].", "A decision support system (DSS) gives the possibility to support users with proactive and personalized decisions in any scenario of their daily living and allows to react at shorter time scales.", "Over the past few years, DSSs for diabetes have been an emerging concept in health care. By means of this new technology, data can be automatically collected, transmitted, aggregated with other physiological data, analyzed, stored, and presented to the patient.", "By integrating e-health and tele-monitoring systems, DSSs for T1DM have the potential to improve glycemic outcomes thanks to prevention of hypo- or hyperglycemic events, reducing uncertainty when making critical self-management decisions [59].", "A DSS for diabetes treatment provides an alternative to the closed-loop system, the so-called artificial pancreas (AP).", "Indeed, a wide range of users do not feel confident with the use of AP systems, being concerned about errors occurring in the insulin pump, and they prefer an open-loop therapy, which can be assisted by DSSs.", "Most of DSSs already available in the literature are composed by a predictive glucose module (which alerts the user whenever its BG is predicted to fall outside the safe range in the next future), an insulin suspension module (which temporarily suspends basal insulin delivery to avoid hypoglycemia when BG is critically low in patient using insulin pumps), and an adaptive insulin bolus calculator (which provides users with a suggestion of the correct insulin dosage to compensate the BG fluctuation due to a meal).", "Many literature studies showed that DSSs are viable tools for improving diabetes treatment. A prototype bolus calculator algorithm based on neural networks providing personalized insulin recommendations has been developed and preliminarily tested in silico by Cappon et al.", "[60]. Breton et al. [61] proposed a DSS with automated insulin titration and dosing, proving that the use of the system results in reduced glucose variability and improved protection against hypoglycemia.", "Moreover, DreaMed (DreaMed Diabetes Ltd., Petah Tikva, Israel) recently introduced the Advisor Pro, a responsive application that provides real-time automated analysis of patient specific behavior to come up with personalized estimates of the optimal insulin treatment plan [62], which received FDA approval to be marketed in the United States in 2018 [63].", "Finally, Patient Empowerment through Predictive PERsonalised decision support (PEPPER), a project funded by the European Community under the Horizon 2020 research program, has recently entered its final test phase, after several preliminary studies showed that it is able to improve glucose control and reducing the incidence of hypoglycemic episodes [64].", "Since 2006, medical devices integrating CGM sensors and insulin pumps have become commercially available, the Medtronic MiniMed Paradigm REAL-time system being the first device allowing such integration.", "Later in 2009, Medtronic integrated systems have been equipped with the low glucose suspend (or threshold suspend) feature that allows to automatically suspend basal insulin infusion for up to 2 hours when CGM measurements fall below a user-defined low glucose threshold.", "This feature, implemented in the Medtronic Paradigm Veo and MiniMed 530G, was designed to mitigate hypoglycemic events in insulin pump therapy [65].", "Most recent Medtronic systems, i.e., the MiniMed 640G and 630G, implement the SmartGuard feature, which also allows to suspend basal insulin infusion when CGM measurements are predicted to fall below a preset threshold in the next 30 minutes (prediction low glucose management)", "Basal insulin suspension algorithms have been intensively studied also by academic research groups. In particular, the group led by Dr. Bruce Buckingham have been very active in this research line since 2009, by testing several prediction algorithms and insulin suspension criteria in both inpatient and outpatient clinical trials.", "Their final algorithm performs 30-minute ahead glucose prediction by a Kalman filter and suspends basal insulin when the predicted glucose concentration fall below 80 mg/dL", "[67]. Basal insulin delivery is restarted as soon as CGM measurements start rising or after 2 consecutive hours of suspension.", "The algorithms developed by Buckingham et al. [67], as well as those implemented in commercial devices, can only turn on or off basal insulin delivery.", "A different approach was adopted by the group led by Prof. Kovatchev at the University of Virginia, who proposed algorithms to attenuate, rather than suspend, basal insulin delivery in presence of hypoglycemia risk.", "Specifically, their “power brakes” algorithm performs 15-minute ahead glucose prediction using physiological model-based Kalman filtering and applies a BG risk function in order to calculate a basal insulin attenuation factor depending on predicted risk of hypoglycemia [68].", "Several clinical trials were performed to assess the safety and effectiveness of basal insulin suspension algorithms both in clinic under controlled conditions [69,70,71,72] and at home under real-life conditions [67,73,74,75].", "Evidences from these trials supported the effectiveness of these algorithms in reducing hypoglycemia, at the expenses of a slight increase in hyperglycemia.", "Nevertheless, the use of basal insulin suspension was not associated with a significant increase of HbA1c or occurrence of ketoacidosis.", "For an exhaustive review of algorithms for basal insulin suspension/attenuation, their implementation in commercial devices and clinical evidence of their effectiveness and safety, we refer the reader to [76].", "Automatic CGM-based basal insulin suspension/attenuation represents the first step towards closed-loop systems, namely AP, in which a control algorithm automatically tune insulin pump injections based on CGM readings.", "Research on closed-loop systems has been very intense in the last 10 years [77,78,79]. Several control algorithms were proposed and assessed in clinical trials, including proportional-integral-derivative controller [80,81], model predictive control", "[82], and fuzzy logic controller [83].

The first CGM sensor to receive FDA approval with the iCGM label is the Dexcom G6 device, launched in 2018", "[95]. The integration of CGM data with data of insulin pump and other wearable sensors, like activity trackers, will allow improving algorithms for glucose prediction and automatic basal insulin modulation, as recent studies with basal insulin suspension [96] and AP during exercise [97] have suggested.", "CGM data integrated with other diabetes management data (e.g., insulin pumps, SMBG and mHealth apps data) and activity data will also allow to enhance diabetes DSSs, enabling a better understanding of the causes driving to abnormal glucose events and, finally, a better tailoring of diabetes therapy to the patient's lifestyle and habits.", "Finally as more broadly discussed in [9], CGM data could be integrated with other clinical data sources, including clinical registries, electronic health records, prescription registries and biomarkers collected in laboratory tests, which will provide important clinical contextualization to CGM data.", "This will allow the generation of a digital ecosystem of diabetes data that could be exploited to extract novel insights on the mechanisms of diabetes progression and develop cutting-edge data analytics for personalized diabetes management and prevention of related complications.", "CONFLICTS OF INTEREST: No potential conflict of interest relevant to this article was reported.", "- 1.Wang J.

The company doesn’t just want to produce incrementally “good” products; they strive for remarkable.", "They want awesome. And their recipe for success is a relentless focus on providing solutions for the specific problems faced by diabetics.", "Interestingly, they combine this narrow focus on diabetics with a broad view on the myriad technologies that may be required to provide innovative solutions to their problems.", "Dexcom seems to have found a way to get the innovation payoffs of narrow focus and deep customer expertise, while avoiding the incremental improvement mindset that often comes with those strengths.", "Having a tight focus on the problems you are trying to solve, Sayer emphasizes, is critical for an entrepreneurial company in his sector.", "If you hope to achieve anything unprecedented in a field as well established and researched as health management, you must deeply understand the problem and be well versed in prior art.", "Engineers at Dexcom invest a lot of time in staying current on the relevant science and technology. When such deep knowledge is required to innovate, a company has to wisely choose its focal point.", "“We haven't tried to make a whole bunch of different products and attack a whole bunch of different industries,” Sayer says.", "“We've known what problem we've wanted to solve, and really designed technology to do that.”", "Highly focused firms like Dexcom are also well positioned to gain deep familiarity with their customers – always an advantage for innovators.", "“We probably have the most patient-focused culture of a medical device company I've ever been around,” says Sayer.", "“Our team spends a tremendous amount of time with physicians and patients out in the field.” And Dexcom’s commitment to understanding patients’ perspectives goes much deeper than conversation.", "“We're all human pincushions,” he says, who are willing to “wear glucose sensor technology to experience what the customers experience.”", "(He quickly assures us that no one is defying FDA regulations by doing so.)", "See the full list of Most Innovative Growth Companies for 2017 here.", "Even though Dexcom pays attention to a narrow range of customer problems, it develops deep expertise in a broad set of technologies to generate innovative solutions.", "The company relies on people with very different expertise to collaborate on different aspects of a product simultaneously.", "According to Sayer, this is the most innovative aspect of Dexcom’s approach. “Developing a continuous glucose monitoring solution requires ingenuity on many fronts.", "Anything that ends with ‘engineer,’ we have,” Sayer says. “We have chemical engineers, electrical engineers, mechanical engineers, software engineers, human factors engineers …” and as these various experts make progress at different paces, “one generation or one innovation might focus on the software and the algorithm … and other times, we'll go through the chemistry side, and the membranes on the sensor.”", "Applying deep expertise in a wide variety of technologies by different groups allows Dexcom to rapidly iterate toward better solutions.", "And the company doesn’t shy away from innovating at any time during the product life cycle. As an example, Sayer cites the latest generation G5 mobile system which came about when “our algorithm guys said, ‘Hey, we have better software,’” and their innovation was quickly integrated, “making it much more accurate than anything else without changing the rest of the system.”", "While Dexcom has built deep expertise in a wide mixture of technologies, it still partners with outside firms to broaden the set of technologies even further.", "For example, Verily Life Sciences, a subsidiary of Google parent company Alphabet, is a key partner. Sayer reports that, from an innovation standpoint, the collaboration with Verily “has really been a good thing for us ….", "We weren't used to a Verily-type pace, and the way Verily people look at projects is different than traditional medical device people.”", "For example, “when they're done with something, they want to launch it tomorrow,” says Sayer. Another difference is that they tend to think big, really big.", "Verily’s criterion for starting a project, he says, is that it should have the potential to produce an offering that is “ten times better than what's already on the market.”", "To do that, you have to shoot for remarkable. The focus on producing something new that is order of magnitudes better than what’s on the market pushes Dexcom to use every technology possible to produce a breakthrough.", "Although many factors contribute to Dexcom’s innovative prowess, this interplay between focusing tightly on a narrow set of customer problems, while drawing widely on a variety of technologies, is a critical component.", "This combination helps Dexcom generate innovations that leap beyond incremental improvements to established methods.", "Sayer explains. “It's very comfortable to do marginal improvements, and just keep doing marginal improvements, and not take any risks.”", "Every young company’s journey to the Forbes Most Innovative Growth Companies list is different. But if these businesses have one thing in common, it might be this: that they have found a way to resolve some fundamental tension that holds innovation back in other settings.", "Dexcom’s version of this is its ability to maintain an obsessive focus on the problem it was founded to solve, while fighting off the insularity and incrementalism that so often go along with that by exploring broadly with technologies that might solve that problem.", "It’s not easy for an enterprise to stay focused when there are tempting opportunities all around — and it’s not easy for people to think big when they’re in a sector more disposed to think small.", "But if an organization can do both these things, then it has a real advantage. And maybe it’s even fair to expect all its teams’ innovations to be remarkable."]}

She is now very excited that the new applicator makes sensor changes far less painful and much easier.", "The new inserter also makes G6 well-suited to one-handed insertion, a plus for those who plan to wear it on the back of the arm (Adam’s preferred wear location).", "Note: This is currently a non-FDA-approved wear location, but G5 and G6 work just fine on the arm, though sometimes tend to under-read “true” glucose in Adam’s experience.", "The biggest downside to the new applicator is how much environmental waste it creates – it’s fully disposable and there is quite a lot of plastic.", "Dexcom does not have a recycling program at this time, though we hope one is added. Diabetes products create a lot of environmental waste already – drug labels, wrappers, infusion sets, strip vials, batteries, etc. – and we hope all future devices keep the environment in mind.", "Obviously, this creates challenging tradeoffs for companies, since improving products and reducing waste can be mutually exclusive.", "G6 is a no-fingerstick-calibration sensor, similar to Abbott’s FreeStyle Libre. After insertion and a two-hour warmup, G6 immediately begins displaying real-time CGM values and trend arrows – no fingerstick entry is required at startup or over the course of the 10-day wear time.", "The startup process is reminiscent of how calibration codes used to be on a vial of strips – e.g., enter “code 25” when opening a new vial of strips.", "In this case, each 10-day G6 sensor comes with a unique four-digit numerical code that must be entered into the app/receiver before starting the two-hour warmup.", "On the G6 app, the four-digit sensor code can be entered via photo (QR code scan) or manually typed in.", "We could not get the app to photo scan the sensor code, despite trying 25 times and on three different sensors.", "In this case, the app allows manual keyboard input.

After the first two-hour warmup, Adam’s first G6 reading was 127 mg/dl, while the meter read 130 mg/dl.", "After the second sensor’s two-hour warmup, G6 read 54 mg/dl, while Adam’s meter read 58 mg/dl. On his just-started third G6 sensor, the first G6 value read 89 mg/dl vs. 88 mg/dl on the meter.", "G6 has also had smoother, more reliable readings than a newly inserted G5, with less jumpiness and gaps on day one.", "See the G6 vs. G5 pictures below for 24-hour comparisons on day one and day seven – they track very well together, but G6 eliminates the fingerstick calibrations!", "G6 users can enter an optional fingerstick calibration – e.g., in cases where the sensor is actually very different from the meter value.", "However, the app and receiver design clearly discourages doing this. The “calibrate” option is buried inside the settings menu, rather than accessible from the app main screen – see below.", "This is a smart way to preserve the feature for when it’s really needed, but nudge against using it. Kelly used this a lot – perhaps once a day.", "Adam avoided using it just to test out the no-calibration accuracy.", "We still have some questions on accuracy and reliability over 10 days, but this is based on our very limited experience.", "Adam got a “sensor error” message on days 8-9 of his first G6 wear session, which resulted in very few data points actually collected on these two days (similar to the “???” symbol that would come up on G4 and G5).", "On his second sensor, Adam saw noticeably worse accuracy on days 9 and 10, with relative errors of 20% or more in many cases (e.g., reading more than 20 mg/dl off when the meter said 100 mg/dl).", "Kelly’s very first G6 sensor did fall off her body after a couple of hours on day one (adhesive failure), something she has never seen with G5 (this happened so fast that she didn’t really count this as her “first” sensor – she felt this was a fluke).", "After 10 days, G6 stops giving real-time readings and prompts the user to insert and start a new sensor.", "Relative to G4 and G5 a big change is the addition of a mandatory shutoff: a G6 sensor cannot be “restarted” to extend the wear time beyond 10 days.", "When trying to do so, the app recognizes it and will not allow the two-hour sensor warmup to complete.", "This is a complicated issue, since many people pay a lot of money for CGM and the ability to extend a single sensor’s wear time – e.g. to 14 days – makes CGM more affordable.", "Dexcom worked with the FDA on this issue and clearly had to make some changes. For instance, G6 achieved an important new FDA classification called “integrated CGM” (iCGM), which regulates it as a lower-risk device (class II).", "Ultimately, this new category will speed CGM innovation, bring improvements faster, and make CGMs easier to integrate with other devices and software (interoperability).", "However, the FDA also ruled that an iCGM must have a mandatory shutoff; hence, it is included in G6. Presumably this protects us against the potential for more inaccurate readings.", "Like FreeStyle Libre (which also has a mandatory shutoff at 10 days), G6 is a no-fingerstick-calibration glucose sensor approved for insulin dosing.", "That puts an even higher bar on accuracy and reliability. For now, G6 has been tested and approved for 10-day wear, meaning Dexcom and the FDA cannot be assured of insulin-dosing safety or accuracy beyond 10 days.", "However, Dexcom does plan to do a 14-day wear trial of G6 in the second half of this year.", "We’d like to see an end to complaints about not being able to “extend” the system – or even whether it’s possible.", "It’s been decided, and we believe this decision is in the best interests of people with diabetes, the system, and providers.", "The Bluetooth-enabled G6 transmitter is meaningfully slimmer than G5, and should be less susceptible to getting knocked on things.", "The transmitter is now flush with the plastic sensor cradle, rather than rising above it like with G5.", "The picture below compares G5 and G6 on Adam’s abdomen. Kelly was impressed with the new transmitter, and pointed out that it returned to “more” (but better) what the transmitter used to look like with the Seven Plus and early G4; it was really G5 that made the transmitter larger with the addition of Bluetooth.", "Like G5, the G6 transmitter is reused for three months, at which point it is thrown away. Dexcom typically ships two G6 transmitters at a time, meaning transmitters need to be reordered twice per year for most people.", "Dexcom is working on a fully disposable transmitter with its Verily partnership, though has not given specific timing on when the first-gen version might launch.", "We’d guess sometime in 2019 is the earliest the first-gen Dexcom/Verily disposable transmitter could come out.", "It’s unclear if all Dexcom G6 users will move to the disposable transmitter, or if this will be a separate product.", "The G6 app has been slightly redesigned (available on Apple and Android). On Adam’s older iPhone SE, the G6 app has meaningfully reduced the size of the CGM bubble/trend arrow, and this cannot be adjusted in size.", "The new G6 app design also leaves more white space on the screen and mutes the colors a bit. Fortunately, this seems to be less of an issue on a larger-sized/newer smartphones.", "G5 app screenshot (left) vs. G6 app screenshot (right)", "Dexcom has put a bigger focus on manually entered “events” (e.g., insulin doses, exercise), but ultimately, it’s hard work to enter them.", "Turning the phone sideways to see the 1/6/12/24-hour CGM graph now wastes half the screen on “events” – an unfortunate change, since they will be empty for most people.", "Events will become more useful when they are automatically collected from a phone’s sensors or Bluetooth-connected insulin delivery devices (pumps, smart pens).", "On the plus side, we’re very glad to see CGM high/low notifications are now accompanied by the actual sensor value and trend arrow on the phone’s lock screen.", "Previously, G5 only said “high glucose,” but didn’t actually say what the glucose value was.", "Adam has had issues with his G6 app occasionally quitting in the middle of the night, something he has also experienced with G5.", "The best fix he has found is quitting the Dexcom app before bed, turning his phone off and back on, reopening the app, and putting his phone in airplane mode with WiFi turned off.", "The Dexcom G6 Apple Watch app is identical to the G5 version. We are optimistic that the new FDA iCGM classification will speed the availability of direct-G6-transmitter-to-Apple-Watch, meaning a user could get CGM data on the watch without a smartphone nearby.", "Overall, Adam doesn’t like the G6 app quite as much as the G5 (Kelly loves both) but it still retains Dexcom’s mobile leadership – it’s the only CGM in the US with Apple iOS, Android, and smartwatch apps for viewing real-time data.", "(A Dexcom app for Fitbit smartwatches will also launch in the second half of this year.)

(1991) defined quality of health care as “the production of improved health and satisfaction of a population within the constraints of existing technology, resources, and consumer circumstances.”", "For physicians, quality of health generally involves a technical and a physician-patient interaction.", "The technical aspects of quality of care consist of two sub-dimensions: the appropriateness of the services provided and the skill with which appropriate care is performed.", "Appropriateness of the services provided requires that physicians make high-quality decisions about care for each patient.", "The skill with which appropriate care is performed requires skill, judgment, and timeliness of execution.", "The quality of the interaction between physicians and patients depends on several interrelated factors, including the quality of communication, the physician’s ability to maintain the patient’s trust, and the physician’s ability to treat the patient with concern, empathy, honesty, tact and sensitivity.", "Satisfaction with health care is closely related to concepts of health care quality. Ware et al. (1977) proposed that patient satisfaction should be a multidimensional concept.", "These dimensions include “the art of care”, which focuses on the personality attributes of the health provider; “technical competence”, or the patient’s perception of the provider’s knowledge and expertise; “the physical environment” as perceived by the patient; and “efficacy of care”, or the client’s perception of outcome.", "Linder-Pelz (1982) further suggested ten constructs or elements that should be used to determine satisfaction: accessibility or convenience, availability of resources, continuity of care, efficacy or outcomes of care, finances, humanness, information gathering, pleasantness of surroundings, and quality or competence.", "Donabedian (1980) noted that client/patient satisfaction is not only an important component of the quality of care, but also a heavy contributor to the definition of quality from the perspective of clients’ values and expectations.", "Essentially, satisfaction could be seen as an objective of care (psychological health) or a contributor to other objectives and outcomes.", "For example, satisfied patients are more likely to better comply with providers’ medical regimens, and to cooperate or maintain relationship with specific providers.", "Learning from these concepts, we know that satisfaction plays an important role in quality measure and improvement.", "For research purposes, the satisfaction construct may be used in two ways. It may be used as a dependent variable to evaluate provider services and facilities (based on the assumption that patient satisfaction is an indicator of the structure, process, and outcomes).", "It may also be considered an independent variable that predicts consumer behaviors (with the assumption that differences in satisfaction influence what people do) (Ware et al., 1977).", "In today’s highly competitive health care market, satisfaction serves not only as a monitor for quality and improvement but also serves to attract patients and insurers.", "The primary means of assessing how patients feel about the care they receive in a health care setting is measurement of patient satisfaction.", "Measuring satisfaction also serves as an important tool for quality audit and improvement in all types of health care organizations.", "Patients sometimes (or always) have different views from the health professionals when judging the quality of care and services.", "It is essential to realize the needs of the patients and collect information on services delivery and operations from a patient’s perspective.", "The results of a patient satisfaction survey can be used to further improve care management and promote the quality of patient outcomes.", "Lanning (1990) also suggests that to assist purchasers in developing quality outcome measures, health care managers should include “patient perceptions,” along with technical competence.", "There should also be a general philosophy that values quality.", "Other studies have explored the use of patient satisfaction surveys in quality improvement efforts in hospitals and HMOs.", "For example, Nelson (1990), after examining the application of patient satisfaction in health care organizations, concluded that the attributes of patient satisfaction were still ill-defined.", "Specific attributes included technical competence, outcomes, continuity, patient expectation, non-systematic approaches, and weak methodologies.", "As a result of the ill-defined nature of health care attributes, these attributes tend to be ineffective for use in total quality improvement efforts.", "However, other studies suggest that satisfied patients are more likely to continue using medical care services when compared to unsatisfied patients (Ware et al., 1975; Thomas and Penchansky, 1984), better comply with medical orders (Dimatteo and DiNicola, 1983), and maintain relationship with a specific provider (Marquis, 1983).", "The proposed models takes into account the impact performance factors (quality and cost) have on patient loyalty and consumer long-term value.", "2.5 Satisfaction measurement by managed care plans", "As the managed care market has matured, managed care plans have been requested to report information on member satisfaction based on the NCQA’s Standard Annual Member Health Care Survey (Mark and Coffey, 2001).", "Quality evaluation systems such as HEDIS 3.0, have been created.

(1987) proposed that in order to succeed in the market, a managed care program must persuade the employer that the firm and the employees will benefit, persuade employees to enroll, and keep patients satisfied after they enroll.", "The major concern regarding the use of patient satisfaction measures to represent quality of care or patient outcome evaluation is that health professionals often consider patient’s evaluation to be incorrect or biased.", "Pascoe (1983) offers a two-part definition of patient satisfaction based on a “contrast and assimilation model”.", "Pascoe’s model takes into account expectations that patients bring to an encounter and the fact that patients may not be fully able to judge a service encounter because they do not have the requisite clinical knowledge.", "In the contrast model, the patients enter the situation with expectations, and the perceived difference between expectation and experience offers net satisfaction in simple encounters.", "When experience is greater than expectations, the experience is satisfactory. In the assimilation model, when patients confront a situation they do not fully understand, they may adjust their expectations downward if the experience falls short of what is expected.", "This theory may help to explain why most patients are satisfied with medical care or personnel, while a greater variance usually exists with respect to other aspects of services during health care delivery (e.g. food, parking, and amenities).", "3. Competition and patient satisfaction: research model and propositions", "This section proposes a research model of competition and customer satisfaction in health care with implications for empirical research.", "The model depicts customer satisfaction as an outcome measure directly dependent on competition, and indirectly through quality of care and health care systems costs, which themselves are directly dependent on the organization’s strategic mission and goals.", "The organization’s strategic mission is viewed as mediating the relationship between competition and customer satisfaction and the patient’s perceived performance and expectations are viewed as moderating the relationship between quality of care and health care systems costs and patient satisfaction.", "3.1 Competition, strategic mission and patient satisfaction", "A significant element of the model is the organization’s strategic mission and goals. The mission or goal of an organization provides a general direction regarding quality of health and costs that reflects the overall organizational internal environment.", "An industry’s external environment, of which competition is a major driver, influences the strategic direction of the organizations within the industry.", "The mission defines what an organization can do in terms of quality and costs and articulates the basic values and principles that guide how services are delivered.", "For example, some hospitals build their reputation on the principles of quality, cooperation, compassion and innovation as the primary drivers and not necessarily cost (Cleveland Hospital).", "If every US resident had an insurmountable amount of money to spend on health care, then health care costs would not be a problem.", "Every consumer of health care will not desire to shop around for price alone, but will want to shop for many things such as quality and customer service.", "On the other hand, many patients will want the best care for the lowest cost. In the current health care environment, this is rarely found.", "Patients must make a decision and unfortunately sacrifice one for the other. Therefore, the mission and goals and the financial support institutions have, allow them to attract the best medical doctors, nurses, support staff, acquire the most updated and the newest equipment and technology and attract patients.", "In connecting competition to the organization’s strategic mission and goals and ultimately to patient satisfaction requires a model that defines the role competition in a way that what the customer expects in terms of needs and wants is factored into health care design, communication, pricing and the delivery of appropriate, competitively viable health care services.", "Miller (1996) and Porter and Tiesberg (2004) noted that current competition among health plans, hospitals, and physicians has been primarily based upon price.", "The breadth of the network and style of care is also considered. Competition has resulted in lower hospital costs and health care premiums, with premium reductions up to 10 percent (Enthoven and Vorhaus, 1997).", "However, it is not clear whether the cost savings from price competition is a result of improved efficiency or from sacrificing the quality of care.", "A study showed that hospitals that are subject to more intense competition and greater fiscal pressure from Medicare and Medi-Cal reduced their provision of uncompensated care relative to hospitals facing less pressure from the sources.", "According to the authors’ estimate, hospitals would have provided 36 percent more uncompensated care than was actually provided in 1989, if they had not been subjected to increasing price competition from growth of managed care plans and financial tightening in public programs.", "However, Brook and Kosecoff (1998) suggest that as competition intensifies, one very likely event to occur is the renaming of “quality of care” to “patient satisfaction.”", "People interested in making money are likely to use marketing techniques and measurement of patient satisfaction to convince people to join their organizations.", "The quality of care is hard to quantify and compare. Those groups that are currently experiencing a difficult time with HMOs and bureaucracies (e.g. elderly, poor, women, and children) are likely to be even more vulnerable.", "Using a competitive model, it has been assumed that a homogeneous service is being bought and sold, and the competition is based on price.", "However, Jacobs (1997) reported that product quality is a major element of health care. It is also a common practice for health insurance companies to offer different types of policies in terms of coverage.", "This can be viewed as differences in the quality of the policies, which yields differences in the quality of services.", "It must be acknowledged that the market is imperfectly competitive (i.e. oligopolistic and monopolistic markets are often found in the health care industry) due to such factors as entry barriers, asymmetry of information, monopoly power, non-uniformity in health service quality or character, prevalent externalities, common motivations other than pure profit, and considerable degree of uncertainty (Folland et al., 1993).", "Due to the imperfections in competition, market failures also exist in the health care industry. Though vigorous price competition is not usually a characteristic of an oligopolistic market, quality competition is.", "Mansfield (1988) stated that technological change and productivity increases can offset imperfection in competitive market.", "In imperfect competition, firms usually have more resources to devote to research and experimentation than their counterparts.", "The introduction of the innovation may not be worthwhile, unless the firm has sufficient control over the market to reap the rewards of innovation.", "Since competitors can imitate innovations very quickly, innovation may not be profitable. Jacobs (1997) noted that when a supplier can vary quality, customers are attracted on the basis of its quality.", "This phenomenon of “product differentiation” implies that each supplier is facing a downward-sloping demand curve, and that they can choose to compete with other providers on the basis of price or product quality.", "This difference in quality not only improves the supplier’s competitiveness, but can also lead to “brand loyalty”, which is heavily related to patient satisfaction with the product or service.", "In the health care industry, high technology services tend to attract customers. The more services a health care organization offers, the more competitive it will be for exclusive contracts with employers and other third party payers.", "Under this assumption, competition could result in the tendency to either have duplicate services in excess of regional needs, or acceleration of technology changes and/or product differentiation.", "Under such circumstances, competition is not better than regulation with respect to control of costs in the adoption of new technology.", "Competition may be better in terms of access improvement. Teisberg et al. (1994) suggest that competition in health care compels providers to deliver increasing value to customers, while the fundamental driver of this continuous quality improvement and cost reduction is “innovation.”", "Teisberg et al. also suggest that without incentives to sustain innovation in health care, short-term cost savings will soon be overwhelmed by the desire to widen access.", "The failure to promote innovation will lead to lower quality or more rationing of care.", "A study by Zwanziger et al.

Another perspective argues that organizations can improve the quality of health care and patient satisfaction through investments in hard and soft technologies in order to cultivate and maintain a viable patient base (Ware et al., 1977).", "A third perspective suggests that by improving the quality of health care delivery, total system costs may decrease without negatively affecting patient satisfaction (Ware et al., 1977).", "There is little evidence on the relationship between competition and the quality of health care provided to patients.", "Quality of health care is defined as the avoidance of death or increases in favorable outcomes (e.g. decreased mortality rates).", "The literature suggests that superior technology or other resources, increases the quality of care (Ware et al., 1977).", "As hospitals actively engage in competition, the quality of care increases.", "There are few empirical studies that have directly examined the relationship between competition among HMOs or HMO market penetration and quality.", "We suppose the possibility that health care markets with high levels of HMO competition or HMO market penetration would exhibit higher quality of care.", "The ability of hospitals to compete for customers on the basis of price has motivated HMOs to focus on non-price, quality-oriented strategies.", "Increased HMO competition or HMO market penetration could stimulate non-price competition among hospitals.", "Assuming that HMOs compete, in part, for quality of the provider network, hospitals will compete for HMO contracts by improving quality.", "As the level of competition within the health care market increases, the quality of health care provided to patients increases.", "As the quality of health care provided to patients increases, the level of patient satisfaction increases", "3.4 Competition, health care system costs, and patient satisfaction", "The literature on the relationship between the level of competition and health care system costs has indicated contradictory results.", "However, with consideration of the time period of the studies, these discrepancies can be explained. Studies conducted during the era of retrospective cost-plus reimbursements or charge-based reimbursements indicate that competition is positively associated with system costs.", "This could be attributed to the fact that hospitals were reimbursed on a retrospective cost-plus basis during this time frame, and were therefore able to compete on a non-price basis.", "As a result, expensive and sophisticated equipment and services were freely added in attempt to attract physicians (and therefore, patients).", "The introduction of fixed payment, competitive bidding made this type of non-price competition much more costly and less attractive to hospitals, which began to compete more on the basis of price.", "In order to lower prices, hospitals had to become more cost-efficient. This assumption is supported by the post-prospective payment system (PPS) study by Robinson and Luft (1988), which showed that increased competition was associated with decreased costs.", "Competition advocates like Alain Enthoven and Paul Ellwood have argued that the growth of HMOs will make health care price competitive and thereby provide the missing “brake” on escalating health costs (Zwanziger and Melnick, 1996).", "These advocates have hypothesized that as HMOs gain market shares, hospitals will be forced to become more pre-conscious and cost-effective.", "HMOs reduce costs through fixed budget financing, reduced inpatient utilization by keeping customers out of hospitals, and using fewer resources once a customer is admitted.", "If HMOs control significant amounts of patient volume, the competitive impact will concentrate on health care system costs.", "As a result of low health care system costs, customers are likely to enjoy low services charges and become more satisfied.", "As the level of competition within the health care market increases, the level of health care system costs decreases.", "As the level of health care system costs decreases, the level of patient satisfaction increases.", "3.5 Health care system costs and quality of health", "Many empirical studies suggest a simple, linear relationship between health care system costs and quality of health care provided to customers (Fleming, 1992; Flood et al., 1994).", "A more realistic assumption is that marginal costs may vary over the range of quality.

The intervention might come in the form of taxes, subsidies, regulations and providing services directly.", "In US health care there are subsidies for older people, or people with disabilities and for children.", "Support for direct supply of services is that governments can provide more of the merit goods or services with positive externalities that markets tend to under-produce; they can provide services in industries with economies of scale and ensure that minimum standards are met and there is greater equality in distribution of goods or services.", "However, government intervention is not always successful in correcting market failure. There are government failures due to reasons such as: poor information about the type and size of services needed to correct the failure; political exigency focusing on short term effects (e.g. in an election year) rather the long run goals; administrative costs and bureaucracy; inefficiency because there are no incentives to be efficient; multiplicity of conflicting objectives in government, and changes in government policy as a result of the political business cycle.", "Obviously, health care markets do not function like the ideal economic market. These markets do not meet all necessary or sufficient conditions for the ideal economic market.", "Therefore, there are numerous market failures and inefficiencies due to such failures. Moreover, the distribution of health and health care is not at a desired level.", "As a consequence, there have to be interventions in these markets to close gaps and improve efficiency.", "However, issues of economic efficiency, market structure, and whether the government has any role in the health care of its citizens can be a cause of bitter and divisive political debates (e.g. 2010 US Health policy reforms).", "Such debates tend to use economic theory without full disclosure of the assumptions made about the market.", "This is particularly true of arguments that support the market economy blindly without due consideration for market failures and their impact on economic efficiency and social welfare.", "The result is statements that sound true to a non-economist, but are totally false given that the wrong assumption has been made.", "There is evidence that government control in health care can have desirable results in the form of better and equitable access to care and good health outcomes.", "Some of the more successful health care systems are government controlled with little influence from the market and others are very tightly regulated.", "A good example of a government controlled health care system is the Cuban system. It is built on a strong primary care foundation.", "It provides comprehensive health care to all its residents with nobody falling between the cracks.21 Despite Cuba being a poor country, it attains health outcomes that are comparable and sometime better than those of rich economies such as the USA.", "For example, Cuba enjoys higher vaccination rates (99.9%); an excellent ability to control and quell epidemics effectively; high life expectancies (78–84 years), and low infant mortality rates.", "Despite being under a trade embargo, Cuba has developed a unique methods of treating illnesses such as Parkinson’s disease, retinitis pigmentosa, multiple sclerosis and other neurological disorders.", "It exports medical products such as vaccines.

Efficiency in health care markets would be judged by a different standard because then the objective function of the health care system would be different from a typical economics objective function.", "The structure of the health care system and its distribution patterns and channels would also be different and would reflect the system’s basic philosophy about health and health care.", "Efficiency in health care does not always lend itself to market forces because health care takes on properties of merit goods.", "Consumption of such goods is desirable because the social benefits exceed the private benefits, i.e. there are positive externalities.", "Like education, health can be viewed as capital stock or human capital. According to Grossman, each individual is endowed with a stock of health which depreciates over time, but the individual has the ability to increase this stock through healthy behaviour such as good diet, accessing health care and preventive measures.23 The stock of health is a merit good because an individual’s health has an effect on the rest of society.", "A healthy population provides a productive labour force that builds a country’s economy. An individual sees the benefits of being healthy, but might not necessarily see the benefits of his/her good health to the rest of society, i.e. the private benefits of good health are less than the societal benefits.", "So an individual’s decision about the optimal level of their health might be less than optimal considering the larger societal benefits.", "This is also true of education and that is why the governments play a big role in it.

It is possible to simulate the impact of multiple variables, including behavioral and physiological in isolation, testing results of different insulin treatment decisions, alert limits, using inaccurate glucose values to calibrate the CGM device, and the presence or absence of hypoglycemia awareness in ways that would not be possible or would be dangerous in a traditional clinical trial setting.", "An institutional review board would never have granted permission to do a clinical study looking at the variables that needed to be evaluated regarding nonadjunctive use.", "Furthermore, type 1 diabetes is an incredibly heterogeneous condition and trying to perform a randomized clinical trial looking at all of the different variables comparing CGM-based decisions with SMBG, is just not possible.", "These issues led 2 of the panelists (a statistician and academic pediatric endocrinologist) to cast dissenting votes on several of the ballot questions asked at the end of the day.", "Dr Bruce Buckingham presented, giving the panel a realistic view from a very experienced, clinically oriented pediatric endocrinologist, and showed how any type of schmutz (Yiddish term for garbage) on one’s fingers can lead to very inaccurate, usually high, SMBG measurements.", "This one fact, a common occurrence, has serious ramifications in terms of over insulinization and unpredictable mild to severe hypoglycemic events.", "None of the panelists had major issues with the accuracy and human factors associated with testing. In fact, the mean absolute relative difference (MARD) of the DEXCOM G5 was in the range of conventional meters and is not influenced by hand washing.", "The most significant and influential part of the day, in my opinion, was the open public testimony when more than 30 individuals gave heartfelt testimonials describing how the DEXCOM CGM has made transformative changes in their lives, as well as their loved ones.", "They had been uniformly using their CGM devices nonadjunctively for years, and they repeatedly mentioned the word “trust” in relying on the CGM-generated numbers for diabetes decision-making.", "The hypoglycemia alerts and alarms were “lifesavers” for so many of the folks who spoke. Young children as well as 70 and 80 year old individuals living with type 1 diabetes for 50 or more years spoke on the values of their DEXCOM.", "Dr Robert Ratner, the chief medical officer of the American Diabetes Association, said the issue was “just plain silly,” and Bill Tamberlane reminded the panel that “the FDA has already approved a CGM device that turns off a persons insulin pump without even letting them know,” referring to the low glucose suspend feature of the Medtronic Enlite 530g.

Alerts and alarms should be viewed as critical components of CGM use. Users should be encouraged to use the high and low alerts and modify them over time.", "However, setting the alarms too aggressively at initiation can result in alarm fatigue. Therefore, it is recommended that as control improves, the alarms can be narrowed to encourage tighter control.", "5. Users should have a plan for preventing or responding to low glucose. Users should be instructed to respond immediately to low glucose but not overreact.", "Users may not see the effects of treatment with carbohydrates for more than 15 minutes. Additionally, as CGM devices alert caregivers, a discussion with friends and family on how to respond to alarms is encouraged.", "6. Respond to high glucose between meals but avoid “stacking” insulin. Constantly seeing high glucose values can lead to frustration and inclination to bolus repeatedly.", "Therefore, users should be reminded that rapid-acting insulin can take up to 90-120 minutes to peak and may still be working 3-5 hours after their last injection.", "Stacking insulin poses a high risk for hypoglycemia; whereas, administration of conservative insulin doses, guided by CGM data, mitigates this risk.", "7.

It is designed to help to minimize the high blood sugar spikes that often occur when people with diabetes eat a meal containing carbohydrates.", "This new formulation, branded \"Fiasp,\" adds niacinamide (vitamin B3), which roughly doubles the speed of initial insulin absorption compared to current fast-acting insulins taken at mealtime.", "This new insulin hits the bloodstream in under three minutes.", "Another advance is Abbott's new monitoring device called the FreeStyle Libre Flash. It's new in the U.S. but has been available in Europe since 2014.", "It's a round patch with a catheter that is inserted on the arm for up to 10 days and a durable scanning device that the user waves over the patch to read the level of sugar in their tissues, which reflects the blood sugar level.", "The Libre works a bit differently than the two currently available continuous glucose monitors (CGMs) made by Dexcom and Medtronic.", "The Libre doesn't require users to prick their fingers for blood tests to calibrate it, whereas users of the other monitors must perform twice-daily fingerstick calibrations.", "Also, the Libre is approved for longer wear – 10 days (14 in Europe) versus seven days for the two current CGMs.", "And, it is likely to be considerably less expensive, although Abbott isn't providing cost information for the U.S. just yet.", "In Europe, the Libre system costs about four Euros a day (about $4.70).", "But, unlike the current devices, the Libre doesn't issue alarms to users when their blood glucose levels get too high or too low.", "And the U.S. version also doesn't allow for the \"share\" capability, by which loved ones can follow Dexcom glucose monitor users' blood sugar levels remotely via a smartphone app.", "The Libre has been extremely popular in Europe among people with type 1 diabetes. There, fewer people use traditional CGMs compared to the U.S., in large part because they are not frequently covered by European insurance.", "Type 1 diabetes requires regular insulin doses to allow cells to use glucose, because the pancreas does not make any of its own.", "With type 2 diabetes, the insulin being made doesn't adequately meet the body's needs.", "About a quarter of people with type 2 diabetes take insulin, and of those, a smaller number take fast-acting insulin before meals.", "Those doses can lead to low or high blood glucose levels if not matched perfectly by timing and amount to the meal's carbohydrates.", "University of California, Los Angeles endocrinologist Dr. David T. Ahn, who specializes in diabetes technology, believes that in the U.S., the Libre will be more useful for people with type 2 diabetes.", "Most people with type 2 do not use CGMs and may also not perform frequent fingerstick checks.", "\"I think it's something that really empowers people, and that's what's really exciting, Ahn says. \"[Y]ou literally see firsthand what exercise, diet, rest, and stress do to your blood sugars.\"", "Of course, he adds, \"There's benefit really for everybody, but the most important question is where is the cost justified.", "I would say that at least right now, it probably is only worth the cost for someone on insulin, especially on fast-acting insulin.\"", "Jared Watkin president of Abbott Diabetes Care Division, tells Shots that the Libre was designed for people with either type of diabetes who require frequent glucose testing, and the lack of alarms was intentional.", "Research shows \"alarm fatigue\" is one of two main reasons many patients mention for not wanting to use CGM systems, he says.", "He points out that research on the Libre has also shown that people using the device achieve better glucose control and experience fewer low blood sugar episodes overnight compared to fingersticks alone even without the alarms, presumably because they're making more insulin dose adjustments.", "Aaron Kowalski is the chief mission officer for JDRF, formerly the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation, which funds much of the research into diabetes technologies.", "He says it will be interesting to see how U.S. patients with type 1 diabetes who haven't adopted CGM take to the Libre.", "\"If you're coming at it from fingersticking, it makes massive sense ... For some people with type 1, I think it will be a really good option.\"", "Both continuous glucose sensing and fast-acting insulin are critical components to the development of so-called \"closed-loop\" or artificial pancreas systems, which aim to automate insulin delivery to the point that patients themselves don't need to make complicated and error-prone calculations about how many carbs are in their meals or how much to cut back their insulin doses for exercise.", "In September 2016, The U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved Medtronic's 670G, the first device that partially accomplishes the closed-loop goal via an algorithm that allows the system's CGM to instruct its insulin pump to cut off delivery if the user's blood sugar drops, or increase it if the levels go too high.", "Several other companies are working on similar technology. One of those, a start-up called Bigfoot Biomedical is working with Abbott to use a next-generation version of the Libre's sensor.", "Except for Medtronic, the other major closed-loop competitors – Insulet, Tandem, and Beta-Bionics – are all collaborating with Dexcom.", "At the same time, a group of do-it-yourself hackers has figured out how to create their own closed-loop systems using older equipment and instructions that are freely available.", "Since that endeavor isn't regulated by the FDA, people who have done it – believed to number in the thousands at this point – proceed at their own risk.", "As might be expected, not everything in this field has gone smoothly. Due to both high demand and the fact that one of Medtronic's manufacturing plants located in Puerto Rico was damaged by Hurricane Maria, it has been unable to ship part of the 670G to new users, and may not be able to meet demand until 2018.", "In addition, the insurance company Anthem has said it won't cover the 670G because it has concluded \"there is not yet enough data on the longer-term safety and efficacy\" for the system.", "Meanwhile, although Medicare agreed in January 2017 to cover the Dexcom continuous glucose monitor for beneficiaries who use insulin, the agency recently determined that the device would not be covered if beneficiaries use the accompanying smartphone app that reads the glucose levels via bluetooth, because it doesn't meet the definition for \"durable medical equipment.\"", "The decision means that seniors have to carry around a separate receiver device, and don't have access to the share function.", "Dexcom is negotiating with federal regulators to work out a solution. In a recent blog post, Ahn wrote \"While CGM approval by Dexcom is a huge win overall (it really is), restricting smartphone integration is absolutely ridiculous.\"", "In another blow to the diabetes technology world, major pump manufacturer Animus recently announced that it was pulling out of the market and is shifting its approximately 90,000 current customers to Medtronic.", "Not surprisingly, some of Medtronic's competitors are offering deals to lure them to their own products.", "Despite the roadblocks, Kowalski says, \"I have tremendous optimism about the future for people with type 1 diabetes.", "These tools are really starting to ... improving blood sugar and making life easier.

We're excited to hear about the panel that you moderated at the ADA conference recently.", "Sheela: It was a panel that was organized by DiabetesMine, a very active blog in the type 1 diabetes space.", "Amy Tenderich, who authors the blog, is a proponent of open data sharing. This panel was an opportunity to bring together the companies that are shaping the future of data sharing in the diabetes space.", "The panel included executives from Animas, Medtronic, Dexcom, Insulet, Roche, and Tandem. It was a very productive dialog.", "Nayna: We'd love to hear a little bit about some of the issues around data sharing from both the patient perspective and the provider perspective.", "Sheela: A big conundrum in diabetes, especially if you are a diabetes patient on insulin pump therapy, is that you need to manage several devices.", "You've got an insulin pump. You've got a continuous glucose meter. You've got a blood glucose meter. And none of those devices interface or interact with each other.", "The patient and the healthcare provider are faced with the daunting challenge of getting data out of those devices and piecing those data together in order to make effective treatment decisions.", "That's the crux of the problem. In this field, patients have been the biggest advocates, pushing companies to work together to make devices talk to each other and to create data aggregation and visualization tools that can streamline care management.", "Nayna: Are you seeing excitement from care providers around being able to access the data, or are there challenges there as well?", "Sheela: It's a good question, because we all think it would be great to have more data and give physicians more data to help with treatment decision making.", "But actually, physicians only have so much time and ability to pay attention to data. The last thing they want is data overload.", "What physicians would welcome are smart and streamlined ways of sharing the most important data in order to make a fast decision in a 10‑minute visit with a patient.", "Physicians do welcome decision support tools; what they don't welcome is just mounds of data without any type of analytics or aggregation.", "Nayna: As companies look to develop platforms or applications to enable this data sharing, there is more and more talk about open source platforms.", "Sheela: I think there is an \"open source movement.\" This has been driven by the patient community. What we have seen are type 1 patients who are savvy with programming hacking devices, taking data out, and creating open source platforms.", "It's good on one hand, because this action has really pushed companies to start investing in partnerships to share data.", "On the flip side, when you're in an open source environment, who ultimately is accountable? If there's some data that is critical to a treatment decision, but for whatever reason, the technology fails, the data is erroneous and the patient makes a bad decision, who does the patient call?", "Who's going to fix that problem? In the healthcare field, you want to make sure that no harm is done to patients.", "You want to make sure safeguards are in place, and ultimately you want to make sure there's accountability.", "Companies at this panel said that they would support open sourcing if there were clear guidelines and accountable sources.", "Nayna: Are there certain companies that come to mind as you think about open data sharing that are at the forefront of that effort?", "Sheela: Dexcom. A lot of the movement around open source actually has been propelled by the CGM data that Dexcom provides.", "It's immensely valuable data, and they've got the most accurate sensor out there. Night Scout is an application based on Dexcom CGM data where parents or caregivers can look at their loved ones' CGM data on the cloud through a web or smartphone portal.", "It's a very important example that allows better management of people who have T1D.", "Nayna: What's the FDA's role in data sharing? Have they taken a position on this particular topic?", "Sheela: Absolutely. Companies have been working with FDA over the last several years to get more guidance in this area, which has been gray area for a long time.", "The FDA published guidelines around mobile health applications late last year and earlier this year. These guidelines provide more clarity by distinguishing different categories of mobile health solutions.", "There's a low risk category, and then there are other data applications that might result in an action, such as control of a pump.", "Those are high‑risk, so they fall in another bucket. Then there's a category in‑between that falls under \"enforcement discretion.\"", "Just by delineating these categories and providing less rigorous regulatory requirements in those applications that are low‑risk, FDA has given some freedom back to companies – helping them expedite decision making and move forward with software applications that were previously held up.", "One panelist commented that getting more clarity around this middle “enforcement discretion” category will be important for the industry as more cases come to bear.", "Nayna: Were there questions around how the FDA determined or defined high‑risk versus low‑risk? Was that a collaborative effort with industry?", "Sheela: It absolutely was. Many of the companies on this panel worked with the FDA, including Roche and J&J.", "The companies have been at the table during all of these decisions and pushing for this. There were several comments from panelists and the audience that FDA has actually been extraordinarily fast.", "This is one area where we absolutely would commend the FDA for how quickly they've responded to industry and patient concerns.", "Nayna: It sounds like a great step forward. Any last thoughts on the panel that you think we should discuss?", "Sheela: It was a great forum this year because we had panelists representing industry and an audience made up of patients and advocates and even hackers who have been really responsible for getting these companies' attention.", "It was actually a very productive dialog between those two groups. Some of the panelists admitted that they were moving too slow and they actually thanked the patients and the advocates for bringing these issues to their attention.", "Companies do have to think about regulatory issues and safety, they reminded the audience, but there has been a lot of advances in their thinking, there's been more guidance from FDA, so in the future everyone's bullish in terms of how much more innovation we'll see in data visualization, data aggregation, and data analytics.", "There are more and more partnerships occurring, even within the panel itself. Insulet has partnered with Tidepool and Glooko, which are two third‑party data visualization solutions.", "Medtronic announced that they're starting their first partnership ever in the space. To date they've always been insular, focused just on their proprietary CareLink system.", "They announced at ADA that they are partnering with Glooko. I actually think it's a very exciting time for this space and we're looking forward to seeing what the next few years bring.", "Opinions expressed here are solely those of the authors and do not reflect the views of Health Advances LLC, its management, or affiliates"]}

In the United States, sensors are approved for 10 days, although in Europe they are used for 14 days.", "For years, Medicare deemed CGM systems “adjunctive” because their FDA approval called for confirming blood glucose levels with a finger stick test before insulin dosing.", "In practice, however, as the Dexcom systems improved, users would make dosing decisions based on CGM data.", "A daylong hearing before an FDA panel in July 2016 prompted a new indication to allow dosing directly off the CGM, which in turn caused CMS to create the “therapeutic” category.", "But the rollout wasn’t easy. Medicare DME providers initially balked at shipping the device when it didn’t come with a meter for calibrating the CGM, and Dexcom partnered with Ascensia to meet requirements for a Medicare “bundle.”", "Dexcom added staff to help Medicare beneficiaries get through the process.", "Meanwhile, the factory-calibrated Abbott Freestyle Libre, which had been approved in more than 40 countries, received FDA approval on September 27, 2017.", "Many people in the United States were already aware of it through a vibrant patient online community and product reviews.", "Glenn Johnson, general manager for Market Access at Abbott, said in an interview with The American Journal of Managed Care® that both DME providers and CMS went through a “learning curve,” but he said those difficulties have been worked out.", "Patient eligibility requirements released in March 2017 apply to all products in the category, Johnson said, so the Abbott Freestyle Libre CGM should be available in all Medicare regions “right away.”", "Because the product is factory-calibrated, Medicare will not require the meter to be bundled with the product, an Abbott spokeswoman said in an email.", "As soon as patients submit required documentation, Johnson said, “There is nothing further required for them to service the beneficiaries.”"]}

delivery systems, and continuous glucose monitoring, most patients with type 1 diabetes still struggle to meet The American Diabetes Association (ADA) clinical practice guidelines.", "Published results from the T1D Exchange found 11.8% incidence of seizure or coma due to hypoglycemia in the preceding year.1 In subjects with 40 year or greater duration of diabetes, 19% had an episode of seizure or coma in the previous year.", "The rate of severe hypoglycemic events reported by the T1D Exchange is higher than previously published estimates from the control group of the JDRF Continuous Glucose Monitoring study, which had a different distribution of diabetes duration and found only a 2.2% incidence of during the 6 months of the study.2", "More recently, data from the Swedish National Diabetes Registry found that patients with type 1 diabetes and glycated hemoglobin (A1c) levels of 6.9% (below current ADA Clinical Practice Recommendations) had twice the mortality as age-matched cohorts without diabetes.3 In patients in the Swedish National Registry, 14.5% of all mortality was attributed to diabetic ketoacidosis or severe hypoglycemia.", "Among patients younger than 30 years, 31.4% of all premature mortality was attributed to diabetic ketoacidosis or severe hypoglycemia.", "Continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) is emerging as an important tool in the treatment and management of diabetes, but the estimated utilization of the technology remains small compared to the total patient population who could benefit from its adoption.", "Early continuous glucose monitoring systems had poor accuracy and reliability compared with today's devices.", "Despite technical problems with early generations of the technology, numerous studies have found that sustained use of CGM technology improved overall glycemic control in both adults and children with type 1 diabetes.2,4–6", "Compared with intermittent episodic capillary fingerstick blood glucose testing, continuous glucose monitoring systems produce very large amounts of data.", "The development of automated data visualization tools for continuous glucose monitoring systems has been a major focus of research in academia and in industry.7–11", "Many insurance companies in the United States now provide reimbursement to patients for CGM devices (hardware and sensors).", "Historically, an additional factor limiting the more widespread use of continuous glucose monitors has been the lack of reimbursement for physicians in assisting patients interpreting the data from their devices.12 There is now a Current Procedural Terminology (CPT) code, CPT 95251 that explicitly covers interpretation of data from a continuous glucose monitoring system.", "However, typical office visits to endocrinologists specializing in the use of diabetes technology are often constrained to a maximum of 15 to 20 min per patient.", "While visualization tools can provide useful insights into underlying patterns, they can be difficult and time-consuming for physicians and other healthcare providers to use in typical overscheduled medical practices.", "As continuous glucose monitoring systems become more widely used as a standard tool for patients with type 1 diabetes, larger numbers of patients will be receiving care from endocrinologists, internists, family practitioners, and pediatricians who are not specialists in diabetes technology.", "While visualization tools for continuous glucose monitoring may be helpful to endocrinologists with interest and experience in diabetes technology, simpler tools are needed for other healthcare providers to be able to rapidly identify problems in glycemic control of their patients from the large body of data generated by CGM.", "A1c is a useful biochemical measure of glycemic control, but it has many limitations such as the insensitivity to glycemic variability and the frequency of severe hypoglycemic and hyperglycemic events.13", "We have developed a simplified composite metric for assessing glycemic control from CGM data without the need for complicated visual displays of data.", "Composite metrics have been widely used in numerous areas of medicine, including the Apgar score in neonatology14 and the acute physiology and chronic health evaluation (APACHE) score in critical care medicine.15 Recently, Vigersky proposed a novel composite metric for evaluating medical interventions in diabetes using a combination of A1c, frequency of severe glycemic events, and changes in the subjects' weight.16", "The metric proposed here, the personal glycemic state (PGS), is intended to evaluate four dimensions of glycemic control based solely on data from continuous glucose monitoring systems.", "The proposed PGS metric includes mean glucose, glycemic variability, percent time in range and frequency and severity of hypoglycemia.", "The PGS is intended to be similar in spirit to the ubiquitous technology of Global Position Systems (GPS), which allows users to identify their current location—the PGS can be a tool for healthcare provider or for a patient to assist in understanding their current position in several key domains of glycemic control.", "It is meant for rapid screening of glycemic control based on CGM data to assist the physician, diabetes educator, or other healthcare provider in quickly identifying areas for possible modification of therapy.", "It is intended to be used as standalone index or could be used in conjunction with more detailed visualization tools depending on the time available for consultation, clinical problem at hand, or preference of the healthcare provider.", "The PGS metric is intended to complement not replace A1c as a measure of the quality of patient's glycemic control.", "The PGS metric is well suited for use assessing the effect of changes in medication on glycemic control.", "It is also well suited for use assessing the emerging technology of artificial pancreas on glycemic control.", "In addition to the PGS metric, the individual components of the PGS metric may be used by physicians to rapidly identify specific elements of glycemic control that could be adjusted to benefit the patient while at the same time continuing to strive to achieve current ADA guidelines for A1c.", "The PGS metric is a composite index intended to capture four separate domains of glycemic control available from continuous glucose monitoring data: the glycemic variability, mean glucose, percent time in range (70–180 mg/dL), and incidence of hypoglycemic episodes per week defined separately as the number of episodes per week ≤54 mg/dL and the number of episodes <70 mg/dL and greater than or equal to 55 mg/dL.", "The PGS uses a new metric for glycemic variability, the glycemic variability percentage (GVP), based on the length of the continuous glucose monitoring temporal trace normalized to the duration under evaluation.", "The results are expressed as a percentage above the minimum line length with zero glycemic variability.", "Whereas other metrics preferentially weight either the amplitude or the frequency of oscillations associated with glycemic variability, the new metric gives equal weight to both the amplitude and frequency.", "The GVP metric is similar mathematically to two other previously proposed metrics for glycemic variability, the mean absolute glucose (MAG) described by Hermanides et al.17 and distance traveled proposed by Marling et al.18", "However, GVP may be easier to understand conceptually and easier to use clinically because the results are expressed as a percentage compared with the minimum line length for a given duration.", "In addition, the concept of a GVP relative to a norm allows for easier comparison of glycemic variability between different data sets.", "The GVP can be calculated from the equation for the length of a line L given by the summation over all n line elements dL based on decomposition into horizontal (dx) and vertical (dy) components and application of the Pythagorean theorem.", "In this equation, the differential element dx is defined as the time between two successive continuous

One evening we went out to eat and before we ordered our food I’d measured my blood sugar at the table and to the chagrin of my company, I exclaimed “Holy Shit!”", "quite loudly in the restaurant.

It’s an Android app, which uses your phone’s bluetooth to connect to the Dexcom CGM Receiver and bring the CGM data down to your phone.", "From there, you could upload that data to your own Nightscout installation or using the latest xDrip beta the app would upload the data to the Dexcom Share servers, which means you could then allow other users to access your CGM data using the Dexcom Follow app for either iOS or Android.", "It’s my understanding that Dexcom is working on getting an Android app completed, approved and into its customers’ hands, and I look forward to trying it.", "However, due to projects like Nightscout and xDrip the bar for their app has been pushed pretty high.", "Dexcom’s got quite a bit of competition from these projects and they’re going to have to beat the pants off of xDrip before I’ll consider using their offering.", "I finally seem to have part of I have been looking for – access to my CGM data from my mobile phone. The xDrip Android app is outstanding, filling a tremendous gap in Dexcom’s approach to mobile devices, which Medtronic appears to be foolishly following.", "If I were Dexcom, I’d be hiring each of the people working on xDrip today or at the very least supporting their ongoing efforts in a meaningful way.", "One final note – Murphy’s Law struck this week with the FDA and Dexcom announcing their next CGM, the Dexcom G5 Mobile.", "Dexcom is being gracious enough to offer those of us who recently purchased (purchases on or after July 25th) to upgrade to the G5 for free.", "The really exciting part of this newest version is that the low-power Bluetooth is now incorporated within the sensor’s transmitter, eliminating the need for a receiver – but only if you have an iOS device.", "Android users will have to continue using a receiver and hoping that Dexcom finally releases an Android app or that the awesome folks working on the xDrip project are able to reverse engineer and support the Dexcom G5 Mobile."]}

They are doing their job following the rules they have to follow but have to suck up your abuse.", "They obviously do not have discretion to hand out free readers otherwise they would have followed the path of least resistance and done it.", "Why do you think it takes more than 3 minutes for them to explain your situation to their supervisor and hear “no”?", "They are going to explain your point of view not beg on your behalf. It would have been more productive to have your doctor contact Dexcom and tell them to replace the unit or they were going to start prescribing other CGM systems.", "I am glad you wrote Sayer, as HE IS the person who can change their policy, not the folks on the phone you cried to.", "I personally think they should have a lifetime warranty on the reader just to keep people using their system.", "Quite honestly there are probably thousands of unused readers sitting out their like mine who use their phones.", "And yes, I also think Dexcom’s customer service sucks. They were supposed to send me replacement sensors 11 days ago and FedEx still hasn’t gotten the order.", "Goodness…she was in crisis mode. I disagree with you about the warranty. She received a NEW receiver thus the warranty should be a year from that point and why a year really it’s just a receiver.", "It was a NEW replacement for their defective product. I have been disappointed in Dexcom since they out sourced their customer service.", "I am not saying that the people aren’t good or compassionate and do their jobs to the best of their ability but they do not know how crucial things can be for a diabetic.", "And that is why your comment surprises me…though I do see your point. When customer service was in-house this would NOT have been an issue they would have just replaced their faulty product…no questions.", "Dexcom should have just replaced it! Honestly, since the G6 rollout the company has been lacking…it’s truly about making money and that is the sad and horrible fact considering the supposed beginnings of this company.", "And don’t get me talking about the environmental waste that this product produces…why have they not figured out how to reuse the sensor injectors???", "Why does the transmitter have to expire when it just needs a new battery??? Why does the receiver need replacement after a year…not much different than my old phone which is 4yrs old and it has way more components to it!", "Oh yeah…it’s about the money. WTF…let’s make tons of money off people with a medical condition that cannot be cured.", "Once a product sells stock it’s original compassion went downhill…it’s truly about the money!

He inflicted the most supreme pain I could imagine.", "Great comment from the Mailman. I am thinking the same thing. Could this be Rosemary’s Baby meets A Beautiful Mind?", "Is there a Kevin at all?

The best proof of this is seen at the opening of the film before we as an audience know who Kevin or Eve is.", "Eva puts her face into a tub of water and she becomes (for a moment) Kevin.

Not sure why I’m so intrigued but maybe it’s normal for humans to be fascinated when something triggers another of our species to act out this way…’why?’, we wonder and, as parents, ‘can we prevent our children from ever becoming such monsters?’", "I agree with Abigail on many levels. I found the film to be inadequate when giving the audience a ‘fuller’ picture of Kevin.", "He was a rather unexplored person but maybe that was the point – we were to only know Kevin as his mother knew him.", "We know he displayed certain traits of control & manipulation (his sparse, tidy room, the guinea pig incident, the way he handled his parents and sister) and we get another glimpse into his school life (empty workbooks) but not his social life at school.", "Very interesting ideas here… just saw the movie ; did not read the book. Actually, all ideas expressed here are not necessarily opposing each other.", "Eva’s character appears to struggle with he inability to connect with her first-born (she does not seem to have the same problem with her daughter).", "She is is surprised herself, she feels guilty because, perhaps for the first time in life, she does not know how to handle the situation.", "She does not give up at trying, but she realizes that her attempts are futile (she really needed to consult about interventions with Kevin).", "This has been so far one of the most brilliant independent films i have watched in such a long time and therefore this film deserves more credit than it already has received.", "With all the reviews I have read, I completely agree on this one. Although it’s hard to pinpoint on who exactly should be blamed, I think the father should have been more open-minded concerning to the behaviors of his son that was already shown throughout his entire childhood.", "As for Kevin, since the very beginning, you could already have seen that he has the qualities and traits of a pyschopath with his attitude towards his mother.", "So I’d rate this film a 8/10!

She did the best she could and she did well, all things considered.", "This boy was a new mother’s nightmare. Nurture is to blame? I think not! A clear case of a flaw of nature, if there ever was one.", "As for the mailman and Duane …. The two comments that take this movie to an entirely new level.

No child is that sophisticated as to provide as much pain and abuse to mother.", "Not as that toddler stage–that he would refuse to throw a ball back and only to drive mom insane? What kid that age doesn’t throw a ball back when these elements are all brand new in life and there would have to be an irresistible urge almost involuntary reflex — to handle the big ball and throw it into the air?", "As he grows no kid is as evil as that.

In other words, she cooked the ingredients that make a monster”", "are you KIDDING ME? if eva’s parenting lead to kevins psychopathy than God help us, billions on this planet are doomed for evil.", "I saw no such signs of her coldness, ambivalence.

If you have someone you love or care for….love and care for them.", "Bare in mind I have not read the book, so my interpretation of the characters/plot relies solely on the movie.", "That being said, I disagree with the statement that Kevin’s character is implausible. Although there were times at which I felt his behavior was a bit exaggerated and characteristic of a more fictional character (Damien, for instance), I generally viewed Kevin as having a personality disorder such as narcissism, antisocial PD, or sociopathy.", "This isn’t a far reach, as (like Tracy Taub asserts in her comment) personality disorders — however rare — DO exist and require a combination of nature & nurture.", "While Eva’s inability to bond with her son during the most crucial years of his life probably played the biggest role in his development, he may also have been simply born with a predisposition to violent, narcisstic, or antisocial behaviors.", "It’s possible that the writer really did intend for Kevin to come off as “evil” or demonic –it’s hard to tell because the root of his behavior and the reasoning behind his actions is never outrightly addressed.", "I myself, however, chalked it up to a personality disorder (which is essentially just the more scientifically based conception of “evil” that exists in many serial killers).", "I watched this movie 3 times, I am going to read the book. I believe he did love his mother, but really did not know how, just like Eva.", "Also remember when she got pregnant, she was parting, drugs, alcohol, could this also be the reason for his behavior?", "I personally loved the movie, it really makes you think , I have to say at the end , she finally realized she did in fact, love her son", "Meh, too many of the commentators here are blindly missing the point. Blaming Kevin either for the ‘evil gene’ or having a ‘mental illness’.", "There’s many blatant signs that Eva’s failure to connect and bond with him, her projection of, not necessarily hatred of Kevin, but resentment of the position she finds herself in post-birth all having a psychological effect on him.", "If you take a blank slate and project frustration and negativeness at it 24/7, Kevin is one potential result of that.", "When she’s having the baby she’s not happy and cheerful as all the other mothers-to-be are. When she cradles him, she’s clueless and timid and weak, unable to sate him, whereas the father gets him calm within moments of being picked up.", "When she’s teaching him with the ball, she’s projecting her frustration. When she’s teaching him math (prior to breaking his arm) instead of praising him for counting from 1-50 she derides and belittles him.", "Every time he gets ‘love’ and ‘care’, it is when the situation gets to an extreme, Kevin projects behaviour back at Eva that he learns from her, that’s the duality we see a lot in the movie, that’s Eva’s struggle as to whether it was her behaviour that moulded Kevin as he turns out to be.", "We see it more in the teenage years, whatever bonding attempts, Kevin is the one that agrees to it, Eva is the one that botches it.", "The night out for dinner? They play golf, she derides his fashion choices, he wins a game, she makes a snarky remark and heads back to the car, a cold, uncompromising reaction, there’s no love, no sensation.", "Kevin’s reaction? Frustration, acceptance even, because he knew it would happen, so he retailiates, he eats before they go out, and what does she do?", "Escalates it, questions him, distrusts him, searches his room, a relationship built on resentment and rejection.", "I thought it was quite good that the end of the movie, when after 2 years apart, Kevin’s thought process kinda clicks and normalises.", "“I thought I knew, but now I’m not so sure.” And that comes yet again, in a moment of vulnerability, in a moment when his mother isn’t actually being a bitch.", "That isn’t to say Kevin is blameless, that isn’t to say it’s all on Eva. Eva’s story needs to be heard, the ultimate societal attainment isn’t always right, motherhood isn’t always perfect, some people don’t get it, some people clash, but far too many commentators here and elsewhere are quick to sympathise with her and just sweep the child, another victim, under the rug with nice little cop outs of ‘the evulz’ and ‘he’s nuts’, he’s not, he’s partially the product of the mother, and THAT is the true discomfort that people don’t want to face.", "Of course he was neurologically ill. The piercing screaming at the beginning, still in nappies at 8, or whatever age he was meant to be, the inability to bond seems to be mutual and when the woman asks the pedriatism, another expert,who is not bothered either, if it is autism, it seems she already senses of the boy is lost, lost, lost.", "It may not be called childhood schizophrenia now as well as fall short of any other known conditions in childhood where something is recognised as missing, but that something missing……..can and does seem to predispose towards, well, evil.", "The autobiographies of the parents who were never heard until it was too late, and perhaps the autobiographies of the child too occasionally, seem to reflect what this flick ‘knows.’", "Perhaps out of guilt the mother us unable to set boundaries, perhaps shewas an ambivalent mother, but another real-life horror is that mother’s do not always get listened to or supported – though to be fair, it may often be the fathers who don’t get heard either.", "The actors who play Kevin were brilliant. Kevin is horribly perceptive and guns down the conventional platitudes of niceness his mother tries to express towards him, with all the cruelty we might expect from someone who is supposed to be a sociopath in the making.", "Some may see him in the film as a truth-sayer, who can recognise that many families and communities never truly bond, they just go through the motions of happy families.", "Perhaps this is why Kevin is so destructive, though his school life is not really explored. Kevin’s illness could then be perceived as an even more global social disturbance.", "No wonder the, that it was too big for his mother to handle alone.", "This movie was crazy, yet good. Quite disturbing at times too. I think the actors all did a superb job.", "It made my feelings + thoughts conflict/change towards the characters, and the story in general – whilst I watched it.", "I just finished the book. It was one of the most disturbing books I have read.

The growth is primarily due to a 1.5 GWdc announcement from Florida Power & Light and 1.1 GWdc announced by Duke Energy in the Carolinas.", "Florida Power & Light’s development of its own solar projects makes up the bulk of Florida’s five-year forecast, with additional announcements from Duke Florida, Teco Energy and Jacksonville Electric expected to add to the pipeline in that state.", "Voluntary procurement of utility PV based on its economic competitiveness continues to be the primary driver of projects announced in 2019.", "While many states, utilities and cities have announced or proposed 50% or 100% renewable energy or zero-carbon standards, the announcements have not yet resulted in an uptick in RPS-driven procurement.", "Corporate procurement of utility solar drove 22% of projects announced in 2018 and continues apace in 2019, with 14% of projects announced having a corporate offtaker.", "(Wood Mackenzie classifies large offsite projects with C&I offtakers as utility-scale rather than distributed due to the size and structure of the deals.)", "As the number of corporations pledging to use 100% renewable power continues to grow, corporate procurement is expected to remain a strong driver of utility PV.", "Despite steady installations in Q1 2019, the residential market is still highly reliant on legacy state markets, such as California and the Northeast, which have seen only modest to flat growth over the past several quarters.", "As these major state markets continue to grow past early-adopter consumers, higher costs of customer acquisition will challenge the industry to innovate product offerings and diversify geographically.", "Indeed, 29% of residential capacity in Q1 2019 came from markets outside the top 10 (by cumulative capacity), the highest share for emerging markets in industry history.", "From 2019-2021, residential growth will range from 5%-20% due to both emerging markets with strong resource fundamentals like Florida and Texas, and markets where recent policy developments have increased our near-term forecasts.", "Maryland’s recent renewable portfolio standard increase, the removal of South Carolina’s net metering cap, and new incentive programs such as Illinois’ Adjustable Block Program will provide significant upside and growth to our residential forecasts over the next few years.", "Meanwhile, California’s new home solar mandate will also help to offset market penetration challenges beginning in 2020.", "In the long term, the ITC step-down is expected to pull in demand in both legacy and emerging markets before declining in 2022.", "Growth resumes in 2023 and continues into 2024 based on economic fundamentals as the market adjusts to post-ITC market conditions.", "That said, long-term growth in a post-ITC world will be contingent on geographic diversification outside of legacy state markets and technological/business-model innovation to improve product offerings in solar-plus-storage.", "Non-residential installation totals in Q1 2019 were the weakest since Q1 2017 as all three major state markets (California, Massachusetts and Minnesota) saw declining volumes due to state-level policy reforms and interconnection delays that continue to limit development opportunities.", "Overall, the non-residential PV market is on track for another down year as the segment acclimates to a reduced incentive environment across major state markets.", "However, this will be incrementally offset starting in 2020 as the next wave of states with robust community solar mandates – New York, Maryland, Illinois and New Jersey – experience growth.", "Furthermore, recent policy developments in New York and Maryland will ultimately provide for growth in our long-term outlook.", "Significant revisions to the Value of Distributed Energy Resources (VDER) docket in New York have bolstered our long-term forecasts for both commercial and community solar, while an RPS increase in Maryland will boost the sagging SREC market to the benefit of the entire non-residential segment.", "Increasing solar-plus-storage viability will also begin to have an impact on non-residential demand as policymakers and business leaders increasingly consider energy storage in their decisions.", "New York’s recent development of the Bridge Incentive increases our long-term solar-plus-storage forecasts with further potential upside.", "By 2023, roughly 30% of total non-residential PV will come from community solar, and ~20% will come from solar-plus-storage projects.", "The U.S. utility solar forecast for 2019-2024 has grown by 5.1 GWdc since last quarter. The largest contributor is an increase to Florida’s five-year outlook from 6.0 GWdc to 9.0 GWdc due to new solar procurement by Florida Power & Light (FPL), Duke Energy Florida, and other Florida utilities (most of which is utility self-build).", "This positions Florida to be the top state for utility PV over the next six years.", "Since last quarter, the 2019 forecast has grown by 1.2 GW, due largely to late project announcements in Texas that raised the state’s forecast by 720 MWdc.", "While the forecast for 2020 saw little change to overall expected capacity additions, over 10.0 GWdc of utility PV are still expected to come online that year.", "From 2021-2023, our utility PV forecast has increased by 2.8 GWdc. While the bulk of this increase is found in Florida, there are a growing number of utilities such as Xcel Energy, Idaho Power and PacifiCorp, among others, announcing additional solar procurement, expedited coal plant retirement, or plans to achieve 50% to 100% renewable or carbon-free energy targets, all of which have boosted the midterm forecast.", "During this time, utility PV also becomes increasingly competitive with wind. As the wind-focused federal Production Tax Credit steps down, solar begins to fall below the cost of wind on a levelized cost of energy (LCOE) basis in many traditional wind states such as Illinois, Iowa, Kansas, Michigan and the Dakotas by the mid-2020s.", "(Wood Mackenzie’s LCOE calculations for solar take the ITC incentive into account.) This is likely not only to drive more solar procurement in wind-dominant regions of Midcontinent Independent System Operator and Southwest Power Pool, but also to make solar the preferred renewable technology for corporate offtakers.", "Oklahoma Gas & Electric’s recent RFP for solar-plus-storage is the first example of what is likely to be a trend in solar procurement in the Prairies and Midwest.", "Our 2024 forecast has also increased by 1.1 GWdc. Many utilities such as Dominion, Tennessee Valley Authority and FPL have outlined solar procurement plans for 2024 and beyond.", "Despite the ITC having fully stepped down to 10% by that time, utility PV will remain economically competitive with new-build wind and natural gas in many places.", "We employ a bottom-up modeling methodology to track and report national average PV system pricing for the major market segments.", "This methodology is based on tracked wholesale pricing of major solar components and data collected from interviews with major installers.", "In Q1 2019, system pricing fell in all market segments.

Mobile broadband is also defined in terms of technological generations (G), where 2G, 2.5G, 2.75G (1990s) technologies were the first digital cellular networks with speeds in the ITU range just noted and represents an earlier 2011 definition yielding 90% world coverage [112].", "As with any evolving technology, definitions must change as the categorical characteristics of the technology change [113,114], so it is important to understand the operating definition of mobile broadband being used, and whether the reported statistics refer to overall capacity (eg, gigabit levels attributed to 802.11ac) or actual expected delivery rates for individuals under operational conditions and distance.", "In particular, many definitions specify or assume at least 3G technologies [115], with Long Term Evolution and Long Term Evolution-Advanced being the current fastest widely deployed mobile broadband technologies in terms of overall capacities and the closest to becoming the global base standard (there are different deployment forms) for mobile broadband [116].", "In addition, intermediate steps taking advantage of current standards have yielded niche standards such as WiGig (802.11ad), which is a very fast (7 gigabits per sec, low latency), but short range (1-7 m) designed for close connectivity, such as eliminating cables [117].", "On the other hand, the forthcoming next-generation 802.11ax wireless specification is not only seeking increases in network capacity but also seeking to create larger “data pipes” to individual devices, thus radically increasing not only the network capacity but also the average data rates to individual devices [118].", "When considering newer baseline definition of mobile broadband subscriptions (at least 3G networks), the ITU of the United Nations estimates that 47.2 per 100 inhabitants of the world’s population is to be subscribed in 2015, with 89% of the world urban population (4 billion) covered but only 29% of the rural population (3.4 billion) covered, but substantial distributional differences between the developed countries (86.7 per 100 inhabitants), developing countries (39.2 per 100 inhabitants), and the least developed countries (12.1 per 100 inhabitants), where Africa is the sole region where mobile broadband is below 20 per 100 inhabitants (though within-regional differences occur)", "[115]. However, comparisons are complex as there is still a great deal of variation in how “mobile broadband” is defined, how specific technologies are classified, and how measurements are conducted [119].", "Regardless, Ericsson predicts that by 2021, 85% of all smartphone subscriptions will be for mobile broadband, but whether it plays a replacement role for fixed broadband or a complementary role depends on the particular segment [74].", "It is important to understand how these characteristics map to target populations. For example, there are distinct issues with the lack of rural broadband (wired or wireless or mobile) in the United States, where 53% of rural Americans (22 million people) lack such access, as do almost two-third of US territories and Tribal lands [120].", "A 2015 Pew survey found that 54% of sampled African American homes had broadband, a decline from 2013, and this percent varied by household income, ranging from a low of 41% (income < $29K) to a high of 80% ($50K ≤ income ≤ $75K) [121].", "The same survey showed that almost 20% of African American households have smartphones, but no broadband.", "There is an emerging trend of smartphone dependence among younger adults, nonwhites, lower income, and lower educational attainment, where these devices are the sole mechanism for both Web-based access (often at slow speeds) and phone calls (elimination of land lines) for communication, but also are less likely to be covered by health insurance or have a bank account [122].", "The decline of landlines in the United States was further evidenced by a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention survey that estimated 47.1% of children and 39.1% of adults live in wireless-only households, with 56.2% of poor households and 53.1% of Hispanic households were wireless-only [72].", "Two consequences of decline in landline use, sometimes overlooked, are (1) the loss of community revenue typically accrued by local telecommunication taxes, as federal law prohibits state and local taxation of Internet data, including communication apps such as Skype, FaceTime, WhatsApp, and Twitter", "[123] and (2) potential bias in “phone-based” surveys reliant on landline registers [72,124].", "The penetration of mobile broadband worldwide is expected to surpass fixed-broadband by 2017 [125]. In fact, the 34 member countries of the Organization for Cooperation and Economic Development now report an average of 81.3% mobile broadband penetration (wireless subscriptions per inhabitant), with 7 members averaging above the 100% mark [126].", "Collectively the Organization for Cooperation and Economic Development member countries’ population is approximately 1 billion people, and the results necessarily do not include data from other important regions, as Africa, India, Brazil, China, and Russia.", "For example, in the least developed countries, fixed-broadband remains less than 1% and escalation to mobile broadband is the sole option [115].", "Regarding health care, mobile broadband is essential for accessing the Internet resources and supporting the sufficient bandwidth for communication capabilities of data-intensive mobile phone app, such as video, without the need for, or reliance on, geospecific landlines.", "For example, the Mobile MIM iOS app allowing viewing X-rays, ultrasounds, neuroimaging on iPads, or iPhones by medical professionals, but developers also provide VueMe iOS apps for secure patients to view and discuss images with their health providers without physical presence required [127].", "Despite the increasing capabilities of mobile phones, attached devices offer another route to point-of-care accessibility via mobile technology, allowing local complex data acquisition (via the combined capability of the attached device and the mobile phone) by a health care professional.", "The MobiUS SP1 mobile phone app interacts with a hand-held ultrasound device, allowing local scanning and transfer of imaging via Wi-Fi, cellular or USB to PC connection [128].", "Dexcom’s Apple Watch app displays patterns of glucose readings. It receives data from Dexcom’s Continuous Glucose Monitoring system that captures glucose levels by a subcutaneous sensor, up to 288 readings per day, and relaying the information (and any warnings) to up to five additional “followers” [129].", "The AliveECG app (with the attached device) allows individuals to take their own ECG with their Android or iOS smartphone (or tablet), which then analyzes the data to determine if atrial fibrillation (a leading cause of stroke) is detected [130].", "Proteus Digital Health has both an ingestible sensor-enabled pill that works with an external patch that detects a signal that is generated from the pill when ingested (reaches the stomach) and records rest or activity patterns (steps, heart rate) that are sent via Bluetooth to the caregiver’s, patient’s, or physician’s mobile phone app, as well as to a secure database accessible by authorized health care professionals [131].", "Propeller Health’s sensor attaches to most asthma and COPD inhalers, capturing time and geolocation data of use (and other data, such as user-supplied medications), linking to an app that can share that data with health care partners or anonymously (eg, capturing timing and location data across users signaling environmental situations), but the app also provides information on adherence and education [132].", "Medronic’s MiniMed system connects its small insulin pump and continuous glucose monitor to a diabetics iPhone, sending pump and sensor information to the iPhone every 5 minutes, and sending history information to their CareLink health care “partners” every 24 hours, or preset text messages immediately if glucose levels exceed tolerance levels [133].", "In addition, Medtronic is also partnering with Samsung to develop Android apps for that device series [134].", "All of the previously noted devices are examples that have been approved, or are being reviewed for approval, by the US Food and Drug Administration at the time of this writing, which speaks to the separate topic of how smartphone technology (directly or indirectly) takes on the role of a regulated medical device [135].", "But Internet connectivity is an ever-emerging architecture. Every smartphone can act as a wireless hotspot affording a gateway for other smartphones or computers or attached devices.", "To complicate things, Bluetooth 4.2 allows devices to securely connect to each other and to the Internet via IPv6/6LoWPAN (IPv6 over Low-Power Wireless Personal Area Networks) via direct connection to any gateway device (eg, a router) and avoid the necessity of a smartphone entirely, thus opening the communication door for the “Internet of Things”—sensors, instruments, devices, and attachments that have the capability of interacting directly with the Internet", "The final characteristic of mobile phone technology is that mobile phones are usually tethered to individuals, though the validity of this characteristic is dependent on the heterogeneity of the penetration of this technology in certain populations.", "With respect to penetration, consider that mobile phone technology differs critically from landlines on this metric because mobile phones are associated with individuals and not residences (requiring a permanent, physical location), so there is usually a 1:1 mapping between individuals and mobile phone use (but this mapping can also be 1:N, when individual users have more than one mobile phone account per SIM card).", "In addition, a US Gallup Panel in July 2015 revealed that on the average 11% checked their mobile phone devices every few minutes (22% of those between the ages of 18 and 29 years), and an addition average of 41% reported checking a few times an hour (51% of those between the ages of 18-29)", "[137]. Nevertheless, the assumption of individual tethering is likely a valid default assumption sans conflicting evidence.", "At a basic level, this affords an efficient technological mechanism for 2 health purposes: data monitoring-acquisition and intervention delivery.", "Regarding the former, individual tethering allows “immediate” acquisition of personal event data, actively or passively.", "For example, various types of experience sampling or ecological momentary assessment methods have emerged to capture individuals’ self-reporting episodic descriptions (event based, time based) of behaviors and experiences in “real time” (ie, to avoid delayed, retrospective autobiographic approaches that may be biased in recall or inaccurately reported) in real-world contexts, such as diaries (paper or electronic), telephone calls, generally emerging in the 1990s", "[138-140]. Mobile phones are now serving as a natural platform for applying such data acquisition approaches for conditions as tobacco use [141], alcohol use [142], development of virtues [143], mood and affect assessment", "[144], diet and physical activity [145], and obesity-specific contexts [146], with additional activity sensor capabilities that serve to augment “message-based” data for such approaches [147].", "Individual tethering accordingly supports personalized medicine or public health interventions as allowing for specific messages to be sent to specific individuals.", "In general, individually-tailored messages in public health interventions are more likely (when properly designed) to effect behavior change than generic messages [148].", "Although the particular definition of “tailoring” in public health and health care has varied widely [149,150], our interpretation simply addresses the fundamental characteristic of what the technology can deliver—connectivity tethered to an individual.", "How any form of tailoring will be used (and its likely impact will be) exploiting that characteristic depends on the quality of the design in the context of an intervention.", "For example, linking an ecological momentary assessment method with an intervention treatment to support individually-tailored SMS connectivity [151], but use of other forms of tailoring exploiting the tethered nature of mobile phones are being developed, such as with human immunodeficiency virus adherence [152], but is a growing component of many SMS intervention designs [153].", "Again, the tethered technology affords various types of tailoring, but the impact of any tailoring depends on the quality of the design and its implementation.", "Of course, the 1:1 mapping also allows for large amounts of (and of potentially high fidelity) patient-generated health data, aggregated for location and time-dependent analyses at a group level, such as disease surveillance or clinical practice statistics [154,155].", "A question regarding tethering involves not only the generation of individual’s data but also one of access to individual’s EHR.", "A survey by Accenture [156] demonstrates how both physicians’ and health consumers’ attitudes and behaviors regarding digital technology and health have changed in 2 years, for example, in patient’s actual access their electronic records (2014: 27%, 2016: 45%), in what data they have access to in their EHR (2014: 39%, 2016: 65%), and in the use of health apps (2014: 16%, 2016: 33%).", "However, the same survey revealed that 92% of patients believed that they should have full access to their EHR, whereas only 18% of physicians held that same belief.", "This is one example of gaps that may exist between 2 of the key stakeholders with respect to use of this technology: patients and their health care providers.", "Characteristic Interactions and Their Consequences", "Of course, the world is often more complex and dynamic than we either describe or anticipate. Collectively, interactions and secondary impacts of these characteristics are beginning to emerge.", "For example, the problem of individuals’ “access to access” (ie, availability of technology that enables access to health services) is evaporating.", "As the penetration of smartphone into all populations continues, it affords an important vehicle for recruitment of under-represented groups in clinical trials and other health-related research [157].", "But as technology forms become more effective and efficient, so do mHealth offerings, and this usually results in differential access (eg, via cost) to the “best” mHealth solutions [158].", "Mobile phone–based apps allow the localization of data acquisition, processing, and presentation or response options to specific individuals, situations, and context.", "Access to the Internet or World Wide Web increases the amount and forms of data gathered and transmitted to and from individuals and groups, over time and across place.", "Consequently, mHealth for health care has generated many variations of technological use, ranging from the ability to generate tailored messages to individuals or to groups of individuals with similar needs via the Web [159] or via text messages [160], to engaging technological combinations such as those being designed in broad, social media systems [161] affording “peer-to-peer” health care [162] or to realizing new health surveillance capabilities through extant technology and relevant populations, such as “participatory epidemiology” forms of engagement and rapid communication [163-165].", "The rise of inter-connectivity of local health-rated devices will not only increase the potential of mHealth but also increase the complexity of its design.", "The nature of “wearable” health devices are currently worn either on the wrist (55%) or the chest (27%) or the purse or pocket or shoe (17%), but are also appearing on the arm (8%), head (7%) clothing (6%) leg or ear (5%), ankle (3%), necklace (3%), or finger (1%)", "[109] and are highly dependent on sensors [166].

Given the opportunities for engaging mHealth apps for public health, it is necessary to understand the broad array of interconnection forces at play, now and likely in the future.", "This is a distinctly different patient-facing functionality than the failed Google Health’s medical records or health data platform [172] offering various forms of disintermediating from “traditional” health care reimbursement, face-to-face models, but it is difficult to predict how the insurance industry or federal or state regulators will respond.", "What is clear is that the upcoming Stage 3 requirement of the Meaningful Use incentive program from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services strongly encourages patient engagement (care management, wellness, and patient supplied data) outside of a clinic using mobile health apps, coordination of care, and patient access to health information via mobile platforms [173].", "Recall that Apple’s HealthKit integrates with the Epic System’s EHR system. Consider that one of the primary reasons for HealthKit’s growing adoption in health systems is the fundamental simplicity of connecting to institutional EHR systems [174], and the top EHR vendor meeting the Meaningful Use requirement is Epic [175].", "Note also that Duke Medicine recently succeeded in being the first Epic-based health system to implement the Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources standard with Apple’s HealthKit", "[176], a standard that also allows Epic Systems EHR data to interoperate with IBM’s Watson Health analytics [177].", "Overall, the adoption of even basic EHR by the key gatekeepers, the physicians, is occluded by the encountered difficulties of data exchange, whether it involves interoperability standards or strategic moves by vendors to gain competitive advantage [178].", "Nevertheless, specific inroads work to demonstrate ways of overcoming such obstacles for specific health objectives on mobile apps [179-181].", "mHealth is an ill-defined, but growing component of all aspects of health (prevention, diagnosis, treatment, research) around the world.", "We focused on 4 core characteristics of the foundational platform, the mobile smartphone, that will likely remain as important to understand to help design and implement more effective and efficient mHealth solutions.", "More importantly, as each characteristic has surprising depth, complexity, and relation to the other characteristics, it is essential to discern how these work together in any particular mHealth context.", "Each type of characteristic embodies both features and constraints.", "This is the fastest spreading communication technology. The first core characteristic—penetration into populations—is possible because mobile telephony is becoming ubiquitous, and this has significant implications for reach into populations, although not homogenously in many cases.", "Therefore, is necessary to know the technological platform most adopted and how it is used by the target population or subgroup.", "Apps are powerful but issues of use are complicated. The second core characteristic—the availability of app — affords potentially sophisticated function (and computation) available to the device, depending on the type of mobile phone.", "In addition, the growth of short-range device connectivity allows ancillary devices to be connected to the mobile phone, enlarging the set of technological options in communication, monitoring, and delivery of health solutions.", "In addition, both the sophistication of sensors on, or connected to, a mobile phone raises the question of whether it is (they are) a medical device (in a legal sense) and how HIPAA rules guide the storage and use of that data.", "Given the immense growth in apps, competition can be intense, but opportunities for innovation are practically unbounded.", "Connectivity matters. The third characteristic—wireless broadband—is the most rapidly growing technological platform for Internet access, so consideration of mHealth contexts with Internet connectivity, even intermittent connectivity, affords a substantially different pathway for expected data rates to and from devices, influencing the formation and functionality of mHealth apps and their target groups.", "However, as lower income groups increase their (often sole) reliance on mobile broadband for Internet connectivity, data charges can escalate rapidly.", "Costs to the client are still a part of the use equation.", "Almost everybody has a mobile phone. The fourth characteristic—that mobile phones are generally tethered to individuals—affords direct access to individuals allowing deep penetration to the individual level, with apps being tailored to individuals and having the ability to adapt to individual behaviors and physiological data, captured and communicated distally (if necessary) in real time.", "The primary interpretation of the 4 characteristics is that they serve as both opportunities and constraints.", "However, to exploit them as either, it is essential to understand what they are, and how they relate to one’s specific mHealth context.", "Regardless, they are the enduring characteristics common to all mHealth mobile phone apps.", "Recently Gordon Moore (the architect of Moore’s Law) stated, We’ve just seen the beginning of what computers are going to do for us [182].", "The ubiquity of the devices, their computational ability, and their ability to capture and rapidly transmit complex data, whether the data comes from “medical devices (Food and Drug Administration approved) or not, the rate and amount of data captured lends itself to large-scale analytics affording new, broader capabilities” [183] which, of course, can be used for “good or evil” [184].", "Along with “Big Data” often comes “Big Noise,” so the merging of technology and health contexts will allow us the opportunity to move from collecting data, which has a cost (eg, acquisition, storage, transfer, security, integrity), to efficiently extracting information, which as a value by guiding decisions that lead to health improvements in individuals, groups, and societies.", "The key is achieving the economically-viable potential to turn acquired data into information that can be applied to the betterment of health, which necessitates not only well-designed interventions but also well-designed evaluations of those interventions [185].", "Yet, there is likely another level where health care, and public health, use that information to inform policies that are enabled, and not blocked, by institutional mechanisms.", "Still the fundamental mantra remains: mHealth is not about technology; it is about how technology is appropriately used in the context of achieving specific health goals [186,187].", "Nevertheless, future discussions must include additional considerations of how to weave the use and usability of such technology into the foundational designs of interventions, and not simply a delivery platform afterthought, as technology is not neutral.", "Translating evidence-based interventions for one mode in which it was designed (eg, workshops) cannot be adopted for another mode without determining the impact on the integrity of the original logic [188,189].", "Mobile phone and communication technologies afford us characteristics with remarkable capabilities and potential.", "And these are rapidly, unpredictably, and even disruptively, changing and changing health care and public health.", "This work was funded in part by a grant from Emory University’s Global Health Institute and the Goizueta Business School Summer Research Fund at Emory University.", "Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act", "- 1.WHO.

In type 1 diabetes, the pancreas produces too little or no insulin, which forces the body to produce energy from other sources.", "It's not known precisely what causes type 1 diabetes, but it's thought that genetics and viruses play a role in causing a patient's immune system to attack and destroy the cells in the pancreas that produce insulin.", "Typically developing later in life, type 2 diabetes is characterized by the body no longer responding well to the insulin produced by the pancreas, something that's called insulin resistance.", "Genes and lifestyle are common causes of type 2 diabetes, with people who smoke or who are overweight being at the greatest risk of developing it.", "Of the two types of diabetes, type 2 diabetes is most common. Out of the more than 30 million people with diabetes in the United States, only 1.5 million people are type 1 diabetics.", "Too much glucose in the bloodstream can damage blood vessels that sustain nerves and as a result, diabetes can cause nerve damage that causes tingling, numbness, burning, or pain.", "Over time, this nerve damage can lead to the loss of feeling in limbs and digestive problems.", "Diabetes can also damage blood cells in the kidneys that filter blood, which can cause kidney failure, and it can cause cardiovascular disease that results in heart attack or stroke.", "It may also increase the risk of Alzheimer's disease.", "In 2015, it was mentioned as a cause of death on a total of 252,806 death certificates, and overall, diabetes is the 7th biggest cause of death in the United States.", "The amount of money spent directly on diabetes is staggering.

It's already studying an oral formulation of Ozempic in late-stage studies and researching ways to deliver insulin via a tablet, too.", "A potential cure for type 1 diabetes that involves transforming stem cells into the beta cells that produce insulin is exciting, as well.", "Management hopes to be in a position where it can begin human trials of such an approach in a few years.", "Eli Lilly gets about 44% of its revenue from diabetes drugs.

Basalgar is a biosimilar to Sanofi's long-acting insulin Lantus, a drug that was generating over $7 billion in sales before losing its patent protection.", "Biosimilars are highly similar to existing FDA-approved therapies. Lantus, a biologic produced in a living organism, is impossible to precisely duplicate, but Basalgar is similar enough in design and efficacy to be used as a replacement now that Lantus' patent has expired.", "Launched in 2016, Basalgar's been chipping away at Lantus' market share ever since. In 2017, Basalgar's sales surged 402% to $432 million.", "Sales are also growing for Jardiance, an SGLT2 inhibitor that competes against J&J's Invokana, and Trulicity, a once-weekly GLP-1 drug that competes against Novo's Victoza and Ozempic.", "Jardiance and Trulicity revenue increased 122% to $447.5 million and 119% to $2.03 billion, respectively, in 2017.", "Like Novo, Eli Lilly is committed to researching better diabetes treatments. It has two new diabetes drugs in phase 3 trials and another two new drugs that are in phase 2 trials.", "In addition to those drugs, it also recently launched an early-stage trial for a closed-loop, automated insulin delivery system.", "If successful, this system could improve glucose control and reduce patient burden by connecting an insulin pump to a continuous glucose monitor (CGM), an approach that's quickly gaining traction (a bit more on that in a minute!).", "Overall, Eli Lilly's got plenty in the works, and that's critical given that Humalog's already lost its patent protection.", "The FDA approved Sanofi's Humalog biosimilar, Admelog, in December 2017. Patents on Jardiance and Trulicity don't expire until 2025 and 2024, respectively (not including possible patent extensions), so they'll remain key contributors to sales for a while.", "At Sanofi, diabetes revenue is falling by double-digit percentages because of Lantus' expiring patent.", "For instance, diabetes sales dropped 15.7% in Q1 2018 because of increased competition.", "Nevertheless, the company still generates over $4 billion in annualized diabetes revenue, but it's not resting on its laurels.", "As I mentioned above, the FDA recently approved its Humalog biosimilar, Admelog, and it became available in the U.S. in April 2018.", "Sanofi's also awaiting an FDA decision on sotagliflozin in 2018, a drug it licensed from Lexicon Pharmaceuticals (LXRX -3.28%) in 2015 for $300 million up front, up to $430 million in development and regulatory milestones, up to $990 million in specified sales milestones, and tiered, escalating royalties ranging from low double-digit percentages to 40% of net sales.", "If sotagliflozin wins approval, it will become the first drug available that controls blood sugar levels by inhibiting both SGLT2 and SGLT1, which is responsible for reabsorbing glucose in the gastrointestinal tract.", "However, an approval for sotagliflozin isn't guaranteed given trial results last year that led many to question its safety.", "Specifically, the trial showed an increased rate of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), a life-threatening buildup of acids in the blood that occurs when blood sugar is too high for too long.", "The safety concerns shouldn't be ignored, but they may not cause the FDA to sideline sotagliflozin. That's because SGLT2 drugs are already associated with a doubling in the risk of DKA, yet they're still widely used.", "Sanofi's also conducting phase 3 studies on SAR341402, a rapid-acting insulin that could challenge NovoLog, and efpeglenatide, a long-acting GLP-1 drug that could compete against Trulicity and Ozempic.", "The pipeline at Sanofi could allow it to regain some of the momentum that's been lost since Lantus' patent protection ended.", "The market for diabetes medicines is massive, but there's also a big opportunity associated with developing next-generation devices and digital solutions that improve patient outcomes, too.", "For instance, there's significant innovation occurring in how diabetics track their blood sugar and dose their insulin.", "In the past, patients relied on finger sticks and glucose meters to measure blood glucose levels to determine when to take insulin injections.", "However, that approach is less than ideal because studies have shown that diabetics spend roughly 70% of their day outside their desired blood glucose range.", "To increase the amount of time spent within a healthy blood sugar range, companies are developing medical devices that continuously monitor blood glucose levels and insulin pumps that deliver insulin more regularly.", "In April 2017, Medtronic (MDT 1.06%), a large medical device maker, launched the MiniMed670G, a first-generation system that automates glucose monitoring and insulin delivery for type 1 diabetes patients.", "It pairs a proprietary monitor that measures blood glucose every five minutes with a pump to deliver insulin as needed.", "In trials, the MiniMed670G significantly improved blood glucose levels and reduced the risk of hypoglycemia, a condition in which blood glucose falls to dangerously low levels.", "As of December 2017, the MiniMed670G is only being used by 20,000 patients, but use of these automated systems could increase substantially if systems being evaluated by other companies -- including Eli Lilly -- pan out.", "Systems from Insulet (PODD 1.08%) and Tandem Diabetes Care (TNDM -6.34%) are among those closest to competing against Medtronic.", "In Insulet's case, it's pairing up its popular OmniPod, a device that can be attached to the skin to deliver insulin for up to three days, with Dexcom's (DXCM -0.54%) popular G5 CGM, which charts blood glucose levels over time to provide greater insight.", "Tandem's combining its t:slim insulin pump with Dexcom's G5 CGM, too.", "Dexcom won FDA approval of its latest monitor, the G6, in March, and Insulet and Tandem have already said they plan to incorporate it into their automated systems in the future.", "The G6 is a significant advance for patients because its quarter-sized sensors can be worn for 10 days at a time and it eliminates the need for finger sticks, which were previously required to calibrate DexCom's CGMs.", "The G6 is also the first CGM to secure approval for use on its own or alongside other devices, including pumps, insulin injectors, and mobile apps.", "Dexcom is working with Verily, Alphabet's healthcare start-up, to create even smaller, longer-lasting sensors that can be worn on the body, but it's not the only company hoping to use technology in diabetes.", "Apple Inc. is reportedly working on technology that incorporates sensors into wearables for real-time insight and announced a big commitment to healthcare apps that can turn personal data into actionable healthcare solutions.", "The IAF estimates that one-third of U.S. adults have prediabetes, and that means that over 84 million Americans are at risk of developing the disease and requiring treatment.", "An increasingly larger addressable patient population suggests that owning diabetes stocks could be smart.", "Income investors might want to consider Novo Nordisk, Eli Lilly, or Sanofi because they're all mature biopharma companies with solid dividend track records.", "A word of caution, though: Any number of things could go wrong or change in the marketplace that could cause investors in these companies to lose money.", "The market is highly competitive and battling for market share could dent these companies' profitability if it results in a price war.", "There's also the risk that new diabetes treatments displace existing treatments or that clinical trials of promising diabetes therapies fail.", "It's important to remember that all of these companies market other drugs that are unrelated to diabetes, so they're not pure plays in the diabetes indication.", "Smaller medtech stocks -- including Insulet, Tandem, and Dexcom -- get all their revenue from diabetes, so they're the stocks to buy if you're hunting for a pure play, but their dependence solely on diabetes for revenue also means that they're the riskiest stocks to include in your portfolio."]}

With a recent partnership with Google, which will provide the processing power, Five9 is knocking down technology barriers and positioning itself to offer contact center services at scale.", "That potential has the market excited, especially since the company has already proven itself as a leader in the space.", "Revenue has been growing above 23% since forever, and Five9 delivered its first profit (of $0.11) last year.", "This year, analysts are looking for revenue growth of 23% and for EPS growth to soar 218%, to $0.35.
