A company can only pay off its debt and get to true profitability with hard cash,” Erickson says.", "At the same time, small incremental price increases every year and a half or so probably won’t impact subscriber turnover for a service that customers use often or one that’s central to their cord-cutting portfolio.", "“Does the consumer feel that Netflix is a good value at the price? If the answer is yes, overwhelmingly they can raise prices and pretty much nobody quits,” Michael Pachter, a managing director at Wedbush Securities, tells The Verge.", "“If you use Netflix every day, then you kind of don’t pay attention.”", "Historic trends for price hikes offered a clue that another price hike was coming for US subscribers sometime soon.", "Additionally, Netflix COO and chief product officer Greg Peters said during an earnings call last year that by delivering what Netflix feels is “an amazing entertainment value” through content and user experience, the company can occasionally go back to its subscribers and “ask them to pay a little bit more to keep that positive cycle going.”", "In other words, a price increase was just as good as promised by Netflix — but cracking the teens is still a pretty significant milestone for the streamer.", "Setting aside the decade or so lead that Netflix has on its rivals for everything from viewing data to its catalog, pretty much every move Netflix makes is driven by making its streaming service as addictive as possible, which, again, costs money.", "Whether that’s expanding its sports offerings, taking big swings with both critically adored and up-and-coming directors, or expanding characters and worlds with gaming, Netflix is burning through cash to try to keep you hooked on its service.", "“They’re going to continue to innovate because now that they know they’ve got to weight in the industry, weight for original content creation — it’s not just a fluke,” Erickson says.", "“It’s proving to be viable for them to continue to diversify what they’re doing content-wise, even if it means going outside of the traditional volumes and types of content that they’re used to delivering.”", "Netflix enjoys an arguably unrivaled brand loyalty in the streaming space — it’s synonymous with streaming.", "At the end of the day, Netflix is cranking up its price by a buck or two every couple of years simply because it can."]}

meaningfully from one year to another.", "The latest data suggest that internet users grew by 192 million over the past 12 months, resulting in annual growth of just 4.0 percent in 2021.", "However, we strongly suspect that this lower growth figure is more likely the consequence of challenges associated with collecting and reporting data during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, and that these

double-digit rate of 10.1 percent over the past 12 months too, but I confess I’m surprised that the growth rate between 2021 and 2022 has remained above pre-pandemic levels.", "For context, the latest

attribute any meaningful share of growth over the most recent 12 months to some kind of “COVID effect”.", "Moreover, with social media users now equating to 58.4 percent of the world’s total

adoption levels across many parts of Africa, with more than half of the populations of several countries in the region still below the age of 20.", "However, basic infrastructure challenges remain an important consideration too.", "For example, in the Central African Republic – where internet adoption remains stubbornly low – barely 1 in 7 people currently has access to electricity, and the vast majority of people still don’t have access to basic sanitation either.", "Furthermore, the excellent State of Mobile Internet Connectivity 2021 report from GSMA Intelligence reveals that 1 in 4 people

users choosing the messenger app as their favourite social platform.", "Interestingly, WeChat gains enough votes to rank fourth at a global level, despite a whopping 99 percent of the platform’s votes

a big impact on these global rankings.", "However, you may be more surprised to see TikTok gain just 4.3 percent of the total vote.", "That doesn’t quite match the excitement TikTok generates in the media, but it’s worth noting that the number of people choosing TikTok as their favourite social platform has jumped by 71 percent in the past 90 days, and TikTok’s overall share of the vote has increased by 180 basis points in just 3 months.", "Furthermore, App Annie reports that TikTok was the most-downloaded mobile app in 2021, and the platform continues to enjoy strong growth in ad reach

show that people are in fact spending more time than ever using connected tech.", "Research from GWI reveals that the “typical” global internet user now spends almost 7 hours per day using the internet across all devices.", "For context, if we assume that the average person sleeps for roughly 7 to 8 hours per day, the typical internet user now spends more than 40 percent of their waking life online.", "The amount of time we spend online continues to climb too, with the daily average increasing by 4 minutes per day (+1.0 percent) over the past year.", "That may not sound like a big increase, but added up across all of the world’s internet users, those 4 extra minutes per day should equate to more than 5 billion additional days of internet use in 2022.", "In total, the latest numbers suggest that the world should spend more than 12½ trillion hours online in 2022 alone.", "As with most data points in our Global Digital Reports, however, there are considerable differences in time spent by geography.", "South Africans now spend the greatest amount of time online each day, with the country’s working-age internet users saying that they spend an average of 10 hours and 46 minutes using connected tech every day.", "Filipinos, Brazilians, and Colombians aren’t far behind, with the average internet user in those countries each spending more than 10 hours per day online.",

quite far down these rankings, with the country’s internet users saying they spend an average of 5 hours and 15 minutes per day online.", "At an average of 2 hours and 27 minutes per day, social media accounts for the largest single share of our connected media time, at 35 percent of the total.", "The time we spend using social media has grown again over the past year too, up by 2 minutes per day (+1.4 percent).", "However, social media’s share of overall internet time has actually fallen slightly since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic.", "Our analysis suggests that this is largely because people have embraced a variety of new online activities over the past two years, so – relatively – social media now accounts for a smaller share of total online time than it did when people did fewer

folks at App Annie have shared some great data with us this year that reveals how much time people spend using the Android apps of several top social platforms.", "For context, handsets running Android account for roughly 7 in 10 smartphones in use around the world today, so – while these figures may not include all social media users – they still provide rich insights into how the world actually uses social media platforms.", "Overall, App Annie’s data shows that YouTube accounts for the greatest total time spent using social media apps on Android phones, and it also clocks the highest average time per user.", "App Annie’s research indicates that the typical YouTube user now spends almost a full day – 23.7 hours – per month using YouTube’s mobile app, but remember that the platform likely also sees meaningful activity on its website, as well as via embeds on third-party websites.", "Facebook comes second in terms of total, cumulative time spent using social media apps, with Android users averaging 19.6 hours in the platform’s app each month.", "TikTok users also clock in an average of 19.6 hours per month using the TikTok Android app, but because the platform has fewer overall users, TikTok only comes fifth in these rankings by cumulative time spent across all users.", "WhatsApp comes third in terms of total time spent, with users spending an average of 18.6 hours per month using the messenger app on Android phones.", "Instagram ranks fourth, but users spend considerably less time using the app each month compared with the rest of the top 5, at just 11.2

extra 6 hours and 20 minutes per month using the platform’s Android app compared with this time last year, equating to a year-on-year increase of 48 percent.", "It’s important to stress that these

1.26 billion monthly active users.", "However, all eyes will doubtless be on TikTok, which currently sits in sixth place in these active user rankings.", "Bytedance announced that the platform had passed 1 billion monthly active users back in September 2021, but the company has been characteristically tight-lipped since then, so that figure remains the latest “official” number.", "However, it’s worth noting that TikTok’s active user base roughly doubled between December 2019 and September 2021, and with the platform still claiming top spot in the global app download charts, it’s almost

And the rest, as they say, is history.", "Well, not quite. Reed Hastings made the decision to pivot correctly. But he had another decision to make.", "And the second decision Reed Hastings made wasn’t just to launch a streaming company, but to launch one that was financed through losing money.", "Lots of money. Billions of dollars. You can see this in the history of streaming. From 2007-2011, Netflix isn’t making tons of money, but they’re also not losing money.", "What I love about this look is that it shows that Netflix really did have a choice to make in 2011.

In fact, executives make this decision all the time.", "When a company builds a new factory, that can cost billions of dollars and years to do. The company, though, makes that investment assuming that long term the additional revenue which flows to the cash flow will pay for that investment.", "(Want to know why pharma companies aren’t making more vaccine doses?

This is how all business investments are (or should be) judged.", "Which is often called “capital budgeting”. This can be about spending dollars on infrastructure, research, new products or whatnot.", "The core of the second decision Hastings (and Sarandos) made (and kept making from say 2015 to 2019) was how much to spend on their streaming disruption.", "The question was, “How much do we need to invest in this service to succeed?” And their answer was billions.", "Because every time they added subscribers, their stock went up.", "In essence, if Netflix does breakeven in 2021 (or for a full-year in 2022), it presents a turning point.", "This is the year that “investing” is over.

First, I’m giving you both the cost of capital from today’s dollars, to see how much Netflix spent of shareholder dollars the last 8 or so years.", "But I’m also giving the 2011 dollars to show how Reed Hastings could have been thinking about it in 2011.", "Also, I accounted for potential cash flow Netflix could have earned at a conservative $200 million per year.", "By losing money, they lost that potential cash as well.", "Netflix actually needs to earn $14 billion to justify the sky high investment of the last eight years.", "The trouble is that discounting continues into the future. I just said that a dollar next year isn’t worth as much as a dollar this year.", "That’s even more applicable in 2030, for example. A dollar in 2030 is only worth 21% of a dollar in 2021.", "Here’s that rough math for those who don’t want to calculate it:", "Without getting too finance-y with terminal values and so on, let’s say the reasonable goal is to pay back the investment in streaming by 2030.", "With the discounted cash flow, what would their potential cash flow need to look like by 2030?", "This is why I said breaking even is only the first step. To pay back their investment—and the longer you wait to pay it back, the higher the returns need to be—Netflix needs to add $500 million per year to the free cash flow, getting to $4.5 billion by 2030.", "Is that reasonable? Sure. But it’s also reasonable that Netflix could flirt with breaking even for a few years into 2022 and find that, as wealthier markets are mostly tapped, new customers cost more to acquire and churn faster.", "In other words, streaming could be a low margin business when it comes to cash flow. If streaming is like traditional entertainment, this is reasonable.", "Or you could listen to the market, which is projecting that Netflix will achieve $11 billion in FCF in 2026, five years away.", "In other words, using some very reasonable situations, we don’t know if Netflix has validated their strategy.", "What we can say is that Netflix spent a lot of money for years, and now they need to make a lot in the future to justify that investment.", "I mean, even our breakeven scenario demands a free cash flow growth rate of 137%! That’s a lot! And assumes they get to $500 million free cash flow in 2022.", "The other big caveat to my entire analysis is, “Well, if you had invested in the stock in 2011, look at the huge boom in price!”", "This I cannot argue with. Though, I don’t provide investing advice. While the stock price is correlated with a company’s core fundamentals, they often move in discreet ways.", "And sometimes the market can have exuberance that doesn’t bear on reality.", "Take Netflix’s free cash flow. I just told you the market believes that, in 2026, Netflix will generate $11 billion in free cash flow.", "How can I argue against that? Well, let’s see how well the market did in 2015 predicting 2019’s free cash flow…", "That’s right: in 2014, most analysts on Wall Street expected Netflix to earn $4 billion in free cash flow in 2021, a year Netflix is predicting they will break even.", "Then they kept making that mistake year after year, pushing out cash flow positivity always out another year.", "Wall Street is terrible at forecasting this company.", "The best analysis of this situation—and there are a few good Netflix bull analysts out there—came this week from Andrew Freedman at Hedgeye.", "His financial table laying out the Netflix options put this in great context:", "(Sign up for his website here! He also helped me pull some of the data above.)", "In other words, to justify the current Netflix stock price, their growth will need to achieve nearly 500 million subscribers at ever-growing revenue per user.", "(Freedman uses EBITDA as a proxy for FCF, which gets to the same place.) The point is: Netflix needs to hit nearly all their aggressive targets and, even then, the stock is only slightly higher than its current value.", "To bring this back to the core point, in a way, you could ignore all the spending of Netflix so far. Instead, just look at them as a company with $8 billion in cash, $15 billion in debt, 200 million global users, and zero cash flow in 2021.", "The answer depends on the fundamental questions for every company: How much will they make? And how fast will that grow?", "If Netflix continues breaking even through 2022 and finds that profit margins are as tight as they’ve always been in entertainment, then the growth answer is “not much”.", "If the growth estimates match Wall Street estimates, then the sky’s the limit. The answer is somewhere in between.", "So yes, this news is big. But the game is not over. Breaking even was step one. Steps two, three and four are to sustain and grow that even more.", "We’ll see if Netflix can do it. And the debate is very well alive to see if they can.", "One Other Big Point: Did 2021 Show That Netflix Was Spending Too Much on Content?", "The other fascinating question is, “What drove cash flow positivity?”", "The bull case is that Netflix fundamentals drove this reality. They invested in tons of content, and all the subscriber growth justified it.", "Indeed, that’s a headline I saw repeated in countless articles and many entertainment newsletters.", "Reality is somewhere in between. But it’s worth figuring out where exactly. Did Netflix achieve positive growth because of the huge Covid-19 acceleration in subscribers?", "Partially. Did their investment in tons of content drive that? Surely.", "But did Netflix achieve positive growth, almost by accident, because they paused all global productions?", "Probably! Indeed, in Q4, Netflix said they were back to full-production on their shows, and not surprisingly, they were cash flow negative again.", "The link seems fairly clear: when Netflix spends at their current level on content, they lose money.", "How do we prove it one way or the other? We can’t, but I will point to this fun thought experiment. On the earnings call after the Q4 results were released, Netflix said that they won’t even bother forecasting subscribers in 2021.", "They said it’s much too difficult, and only forecast adding 6 million subscribers in Q1.", "All finance boils down to this: money you make and money you spend. If Netflix has said they can’t reliably forecast how much money they will make, how can they confidently know they will break even in 2021?", "Because of what Netflix can control. Costs. Which means content costs. If Netflix is forecasting breakeven in 2021, but they have no idea how many subscribers they’ll grow by, they’re basically saying they’ll ensure they get there by right-sizing content costs to break even.", "Meaning they’ll cut costs if they need to break even.", "The implications of this are, in fact, the exact opposite of every smart pundit saying Netflix has justified its content spend.", "If anything, 2021 showed Netflix—almost by accident!—that they were much too aggressive on making original content.", "Sans Coronavirus, likely Netflix loses $2 billion again in 2020, then tries to lower that in 2021 to break even.", "This ties to the strategic point above. Yes, Hastings and Sarandos built a global powerhouse. Did they need to lose $14 billion to do it?"]}

Some news articles state more precisely that library users watch films for free, but of course the library pays for the service.", "A fee for the service is not in itself a surprise or a problem: Kanopy has a lot of good content and their offerings include foreign films, older films, independent features, documentaries, and experimental work that other widely available streaming platforms have historically lacked.", "However, Kanopy is not just like Netflix, or any other subscription video on demand service (SVOD), even if its innovation is applying a Netflix-style user-friendly platform to the library market.", "As much as Kanopy cultivates this confusion in the user’s mind, its website’s economic model works very differently from subscription streaming sites, and these differences have an impact, especially in higher education.", "Particularly as newer, distributor-run streaming services like Criterion Channel and OVID start up, it is worth highlighting how Kanopy operates in a fundamentally different way.", "Recently, an increasing number of scholars have become aware of a simple fact about the service: university and college libraries do not pay a flat fee like individuals might for Netflix, Hulu, or the (now defunct) FilmStruck.", "Instead, Kanopy’s platform drives “patron-driven acquisition” in which three viewings (defined as 30 seconds or more of a title) trigger a library license fee per title.", "(The figures I’ve seen are $150 for a year, $350 for a 3-year license, though the price might vary or change over time.)", "Those fees can add up quickly, and some libraries have felt a strain on their budgets. For instance, Stanford University called Kanopy’s cost “no longer sustainable” as they announced their switch from an open-platform version to a limited-access, request-only version (the only way libraries can turn off the license fee trigger of patron-driven acquisition).", "[3] However, these issues do not affect public libraries, which pay Kanopy per view (current fee of $2), similar to a transaction video on demand (TVOD) service like iTunes.", "[4] Still, patrons do their local public library’s budget no favors by streaming the “free” Kanopy titles, even if those libraries presumably factor in the streaming costs as part of their mission.", "The average media consumer, accustomed to a $13 Netflix monthly subscription or a $20 Blu-Ray, might be shocked at Kanopy’s education-market price of $150 per film.", "However, Kanopy did not invent the disparity. Since the advent of the VCR, there has been a split between personal-use and educational pricing.", "What Kanopy is actually doing is providing a subscription-like experience for a video market driven by per-title educational (not individual subscription) pricing.", "For instance, a DVD of Julie Dash’s Illusions costs about $20 for home personal use but $275 for universities to purchase.", "There are two main reasons for this disparity. First, educational pricing sometimes includes public-performance rights.", "While U.S. copyright allows classroom screening without such rights, distributors ask for payment for any public screenings that may take place outside the classroom.", "[5] Second, and more crucially, universities and colleges are the primary market for many works, especially documentaries, experimental films, or video art works.", "Some distributors like Electronic Arts Intermix or Torch Films sell exclusively at the educational price, whereas others including Zipporah Films, Women Make Movies, or the Video Data Bank sell some films on a limited basis at a home-video price while charging much more to educational institutions.", "Distributors with crossover titles, such as Kino Lorber, First Run, and Icarus, release some films in a general home video release but restrict certain films for educational pricing.", "The positive side of educational pricing is that more money per unit goes to the filmmaker, even as the distributor gets a percentage, too.", "The negative side is that it prices many films out of the reach of many potential viewers. (Even research libraries have budget constraints.)", "Might distributors be better off pricing their films lower to get wider distribution? Perhaps, but they have a plan based on their long experience with the market.", "Niche distributors, including distributors of many of the canonical films that scholars study or teach, are wary of cannibalizing the educational market with cheaper home video; for major studios, though, universities are only a small fraction of their distribution.", "For example, the wide release of Pioneers: First Women Filmmakers from Kino Lorber or a Chantal Akerman box set from Icarus or Criterion allows more DVDs and BluRays to be sold but also undoubtedly eats into a lucrative educational market.", "(It should be noted that major studio films, often handled through distributors like Swank Motion Pictures, are also more expensive when priced for public performance and educational streaming.)", "However, the economic and cultural changes brought by Netflix and Kanopy have encouraged niche distributors to consider adopting streaming initiatives aimed at personal use.", "The Criterion Collection has long been aimed toward the home-video market and accordingly has had a sustained involvement with streaming, first with Hulu, then as part of a partnership with Turner Classic Movies (TCM) for FilmStruck.", "The demise of FilmStruck, driven by Warner Media’s declining commitment to niche distribution, led Criterion to start a self-standing Criterion Channel modeled after FilmStruck, curated around themes, periods and auteurs and supplementing films in the Janus/Criterion collection with other repertory titles.", "With coincidental timing, Docuseek, a streaming platform geared toward and priced for the educational market, created OVID.tv for the personal market.", "OVID combines documentary and art-house fiction offerings from Icarus, First Run, Grasshopper Film, Women Make Movies, KimStim, Distrib Films, and Bullfrog Films into a subscription video on demamd (SVOD) service.", "These new services will enter a marketplace competing with existing cinephile streaming site MUBI as well as more niche on-demand services like DocAlliance.", "I see the model of distributor-run streaming sites to be a positive development, even if it remains to be seen how viable or popular they will become.", "In all, Kanopy is a mixed blessing. For those who teach cinema, it addresses some limitations of physical media—but at a cost.", "Universities may curtail screening time for classes, or libraries may not have adequate facilities for DVD or Blu-Ray viewing, especially for a large-enrollment class.", "However, there is the very real matter of student culture: students are more likely to stream films and may even lack devices to play back physical media.", "For niche distributors and independent filmmakers, streaming websites – not just Kanopy but also other educational market platforms like Films on Demand, Docuseek, or Alexander Street – can now offer expanded audiences and continued revenue.", "At the same time, streaming fees eat into library budgets for physical media acquisitions. DVDs and BluRay discs last far longer than temporary streaming licenses.", "Further, others have pointed out to me how content on Kanopy can be mislabeled or of poor quality. The uneven content affects public-library users of Kanopy, too, as do wider general concerns about data privacy.", "[6] I wonder, as well, if Kanopy is serving the independent distributor well, since pricing does not vary per title (a cheap public domain film gets the same fee as an expensively restored version) and since Kanopy takes a cut (probably at least 30%), like other content aggregators.", "Ultimately, the decision around Kanopy or other streaming websites lies with the libraries. But it might be wise for film scholars housed at higher-education institutions to be aware of the pricing constraints that streaming services place on their university libraries’ overall acquisitions.", "I do not intend to paint Kanopy as the bad guy in the story of streaming access – the company has brought an innovation to an underserved marketplace, added convenience, and expanded the audience for many films – but as an educator, film scholar, and general cinephile, I am particularly sensitive to the imperative to support physical media and independent distributors, and remain committed to searching out streaming alternatives featuring independent content, even for my personal use.", "It will be to the benefit of independent and niche cinema – experimental works, documentaries, and art films – if independent distributors are able to find a sustainable business model and navigate both the budgetary crunch that higher-education institutions are facing and the wider marketplace for on-demand cinema.", "The oligopolistic market has accustomed users to cheap or “free” content, but there are losers in that order of things.", "This article began its life on Twitter and I would like to acknowledge the initial feedback that I’ve incorporated since, including from Kate Rennebohm, Paul McEwan, and Martin Johnson.", "[1] Monica Castillo, “How to Stream Thousands of Free Movies Using Your Library Card,” The New York Times, August, 24, 2017, web, https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/24/watching/kanopy-criterion-collection-librarycard.html; Brian Raferty, “The Best (Free) Streaming Service You’ve Never Heard Of,” Wired, December 5, 2018, web, https://www.wired.com/story/kanopy-best-movies-streaming/; Karl Quinn, “Meet Kanopy, the streaming service that’s just like Netflix, only free,” The Sydney Morning Herald, February 16, 2018, web, https://www.smh.com.au/entertainment/movies/meet-kanopy-the-streaming-service-thats-just-like-netflix-only-free-20180215-h0w63j.html.", "[2] Zach Shonfeld, “Netflix, Streaming Video and the Slow Death of the Classic Film,” Newsweek, September 17, 2017, web, https://www.newsweek.com/2017/09/22/netflix-streaming-movies-classics-664512.html; Anthony Kaufman, “The Decline of Indies on Netflix: Were They Amputated With the Long Tail?”", "Indiewire, September 27, 2011, web, https://www.indiewire.com/2011/09/the-decline-of-indies-on-netflix-were-they-amputated-with-the-long-tail-51952/.", "[3] “Changes to Kanopy Streaming Service,” Stanford Libraries website, December 13, 2018, http://library.stanford.edu/node/155907.", "[4] See for instance, the service contract between The City of Austin and Kanopy, December 7, 2017, Exhibit A, http://www.austintexas.gov/edims/document.cfm?id=310429.", "[5] 17 U.S.C. 110(1); https://www.copyright.gov/title17/92chap1.html.", "[6]See Zach Whittaker on Kanopy’s recent data breach, “Streaming Site Kanopy Exposed Viewing Habits of Users, Researcher Says,” Tech Crunch, March, 21, 2019, web, https://techcrunch.com/2019/03/21/kanopy-data-leak/.", "This article has been updated with corrections to the original."]}

Or they may be fine with it, but still end up cancelling when the bill gets higher.", "Also, the surveys above still have relatively small sample sizes (two surveys combine for 1,000 together.)", "Moreover, in some cases, the respondents may not even be the true decision-maker.

Mainly using the “Netflix tells us good news rule”. Is Netflix MAUs on average above 90%?", "If it were, they would definitely tell us. If it was above 80%, that’d still be good and they may tell us.", "If it’s below 80%, I don’t think Netflix would.

Consider this…", "In other words, based off assumptions that nine months of price increase at an average of $1.50 per customer (which could be a pinch high, with some customers downgrading), you get roughly a $820 million dollars in extra cash.", "Since Netflix is forecasting another $3 billion in free cash flow losses in 2019 (per the last earnings report), that means without the price increase, you would see FCF losses climb to $4 billion in 2019.", "In other words, they need this price increase to keep FCF losses under control.", "Unlike past years, more and more market observers are watching this cash burn. By finally getting control of losses (holding steady at $3 billion) Wall Street will likely stay on the Netflix bandwagon.", "If losses had increased to $4 billion, would investors have the same patience? If your FCF losses increase by a billion dollars every year like clock work, it gets tough to say it won’t just keep increasing forever without serious pain.", "This would be the biggest argument against the Netflix PhDs and finance guys who approved the price increase.", "Netflix may really, really want subscriber growth–and so does Wall Street–but are willing to take a decay in customer growth simply to shore up the losses.", "This may be a protective move for the stock price, sacrificing US growth for cash, while focusing on international gains.", "Netflix could be in for a year of flat subscriber growth with this move…and they know it…but they had to do it anyways.", "Before I make my predictions, I want to explain the difficulty in making this prediction. Consider this the analysis of the data set before us, and it applies to everyone, including people at the company.", "First, this is a classic “small sample size” problem.", "Frankly, Netflix doesn’t have as a large of a sample size for their economists to leverage as I made it appear above.", "Sure, each year gives you a quarterly subscriber number. So 2008-2018 is 11 years by 4 quarters, or a sample size of 44.", "Except, the initial growth really isn’t representative. They transitioned a lot of people over from DVDs.", "We could look at monthly data, which would multiply it by 12, but that’s probably too granular for how often Netflix changes prices.", "If we just went by price changes we are at a sample size below ten. So no matter what model you build, you won’t have a lot of data to leverage.", "Second, there are multiple variables to consider, in addition to price.", "The problem with those fancy models is they may not have priced in the value of all that content correctly.", "If the model makes the assumption, “We can replace Disney/Warner streaming content with originals” and it turns out their originals aren’t popular with people (though still popular with critics), then the double whammy of price increases and content loss could lead to a drop out.", "Moreover, new services are entering that will compete for share of wallet. All these factors should work together to make us very uncertain here.", "So for everyone—myself included—who is willing to make a prediction: don’t! Or do so with a huge grain of salt.", "Your “90% confidence interval”—hat tip to Kahneman, Tversky, and OB professors everywhere—should be really large.", "Again, if the goal is to make a prediction that is right 9 times out of ten, then make the range very large.", "I have two. First, many of the people debating this on Twitter will not actually make a quantified prediction.", "They will say something like, “This price increase will not materially effect Netflix’s subscriber growth.”", "With a prediction like that, nothing is quantified. Even if they are wrong, how could I prove it? There is so much wiggle room they could easily debate the facts.", "Still, I think we’re smarter when we at least try to quantify our predictions. It forces us to think through the issues.", "So as foolish as it may be, I’m going to make a prediction. For the upper range, Netflix saw a real world subscriber increase of 11% in 2018.", "It was 10% the year before that, so I’m making 10% my upper interval on my prediction. In other words, I see a best case scenario where the price increase doesn’t hurt subscriber growth.", "For the floor, this is tougher. And this is where I worry about being too confident in my prediction.", "Again, it is very, very hard to be right 90% of the time. We’re often too over-confident. So I can see an upper growth of 10%, but if the price increase back fires, along with all the content leaving, I could see a scenario where Netflix loses 10% of their customer base.", "Yikes, that sounds high, but again I want to be right 9 times out of 10 here. Here’s a table with potential % drop out rates to judge for yourself:", "Now to the prediction itself. Assuming a 80% MAU rate (on the high end of my range), with a 10% “willing to drop out” gives me 2% growth.", "That sounds right and gets me right to about 60 million customers. So there you have that prediction.", "Prediction: 2% growth in subscribers, up to 60 million customers at the end of 2019.", "90% Confidence Interval: 52.6-64.3 million customers in the end of 2019.

He will always be James Bond.", "So great. A few quick things about his background , there's not a lot on the internet about or with Barry McCarthy himself.", "In fact, as far as I can find—and I looked pretty deeply—the only dedicated, long-form interview with Barry McCarthy on the internet is on YouTube with the headmaster of his high school that he went to, a school called the Hill School.", "David: It's a boarding school in the Philadelphia area. I went to Tower Hill School in Wilmington, Delaware, also in the broader Philadelphia area and people would always get the Hill School and Tower Hill School confused.", "Ben: Your upbringing is somehow related to every episode these days. Are we only selecting for people in the Southeastern Pennsylvania region?", "David: Totally, the Mid-Atlantic region. This interview is actually amazing. It's an hour-long, we'll link to it in the show notes.", "As of yesterday, it had 100 views total on YouTube.", "Ben: Now it's up to like 500 or 600. It's still super small.", "David: If you do nothing else from this episode, go watch this interview with Barry and you will get a sense of this man and his experience.", "Ben: It's also six months ago so it's very recent. For a very long time, he had basically no public appearances.", "David: Very relevant to this news today that I was going to save this for later in the episode, but one of the final questions that the headmaster—who's a wonderful interviewer—asked him, Barry, are you bored in retirement?", "Now that he's retired from Spotify fully at this point. His answer is, yes. I'd like to think that I have another game in me and how prescient that would prove to be.", "We all know that Barry becomes the CFO of Netflix when the company is a very, very small, still a startup.", "I think there were only about 40 people at Netflix when he joined, and it was certainly pre-IPO, pre there being a real business there, which we'll get into.", "This was also not early in Barry's career. How did he end up becoming the CFO of Netflix? He had been the CFO previously to Netflix of another company, actually a digital music streaming company.", "David: He was the CFO of a company called Music Choice. Music Choice, do you remember back in the early days of digital cable and satellite TV, there used to be those channels.", "We had DirecTV growing up, I think they're in like the 600s or 700s.", "Ben: It was sort of like Sirius XM in a way. It was like each one was a genre?", "David: It was exactly like Sirius XM, but just on your cable box or your satellite box. You go to XYZ channel and they'd have some crazy ‘90s era visualizations.", "Ben: Yes. You'll still see him in hotel rooms sometimes.", "David: Totally. That was Music Choice. Barry was the CFO of Music Choice. It's a cable channel. It’s subscription, revenue, music streaming—how prescient.", "Ben: Well primed for the ultimate Spotify gig that he would take when you took them public.", "David: Some other things, and I learned this from that interview, he had been a management consultant at Booz Allen, I think, early in his career, and then an investment banker for a long time.", "It's a well-trodden path from senior investment banker to going and becoming CFO of a company. Music Choice may have been public at that point in time.", "How did he find his way out to California and Netflix? He got fired as CFO of Music Choice. I don't know if it was part of a rift and if there were layoffs or if he got fired directly, but he's very open about this.", "Ben: Most rifts don't include the CFO unless it's performance-based.", "David: Right. Usually, the CFO is the one orchestrating the rift. He got fired and he was 45 years old.", "He had already had this long career as an investment banker and then as a CFO and been fired. What an inspiration to go from that to having so many more chapters to come even now to a new chapter at 68 years old.", "Ben: Label it what you want—growth mindset, learning from your mistakes, or anything like that. It does feel like this guy is compounding knowledge.", "David: I wonder if also, again, we talked at the top of history and facts about how this was a hard week for so many people at Peloton and our hearts are with them, it's hard.", "Barry went through this himself. How does he end up going out to Netflix? Netflix was recruiting for a CFO and nobody wanted the job, and we may have talked about this a little bit in our Netflix episode.", "But in the early days of Netflix, it was not a hot startup in Silicon Valley.", "It was far from it. Marc Randolph had originally started it. Reed got involved a little later. I also did not know this, or at least I didn't remember it from the Netflix episode, it was not a subscription business.", "The original business of Netflix was you paid per rental. It was literally like Blockbuster and that is not a good business.", "Ben: Oh, I don't think I knew that either, or at least I didn't remember that. The other crazy Netflix thing that I always sort of forget about until I reread it is that they sort of timed it with DVDs becoming more widely distributed.", "When they were starting the company, they sounded extra crazy because not only was it kind of a crazy idea, but it was a bet on DVDs and DVDs weren't popular yet.", "It's like, what do you mean you're going to mail discs? No one has a player for those discs yet.", "David: Totally. This was a tough role to recruit for and that's how Barry ended up becoming a candidate.", "Then he and Reed immediately hit it off. He joined and obviously, in many ways, the rest is history there.", "Also, I think it's important, it wasn't a subscription business. Barry was alongside Reed part of architecting the truly incredible business model of Netflix of becoming a subscription business.", "They had done, before he joined, just about a million dollars in revenue on the pay-per-rental model.", "He joins, this is all pre-IPO, they implement the subscription business model. It goes from $1 million to $5 million in revenue that year.", "The next year, $35 million and then hundreds of millions after that.", "Then they IPO, there's the fight with Blockbuster, all that we talked about in the part one of the Netflix story.", "In 2003, it's a public company, Barry tells Reed, you know what, this has been an incredible journey.", "I think he had been there for maybe five years at that point, five or six years. I'm ready for my next challenge.", "I want to go be the CEO of a company next. I've realized I'm really operational. I love this. He talks with Reed, he talks with the board.", "They announce on a public earnings call that Barry is going to be stepping down. He stayed an extra year throughout the year in 2003 to manage the transition, do it right, and find his next challenge.", "Ben: Netflix is boring. It's done. Everything's going to be smooth sailing and successful from here on out", "David: Then Amazon, I don't know if they ever publicly announced, but word got out that Amazon was going to enter the market and compete directly with Netflix, which of course they did in a different way much later in history.", "The stock gets hammered. Literally, the stock price literally dropped 60%, shades of what's happening with Peloton now.", "Ben: And 60 is a modest drop compared to what happened with Peloton.", "David: Yeah, right. It's crisis mode. It's wartime again at Netflix. Barry, one of the many reasons why we love him here at Acquired and his story, he says, I can't leave.", "I got to stay through this fight. He literally—word for word on a public earnings call—announces that he's staying, he's not leaving, and his reason is, \"you don't leave your friends in the middle of a knife fight.\"", "Ben: It's just so good. Barry is Mr. Wartime. In the parlance of Ben Horowitz's Peacetime CEOs and Wartime CEOs, this is Mr. Wartime.", "When things kind of feel easy, they're going to keep growing year over year, and we don't have an existential crisis in front of us, that's when he decides, okay, you guys are good without me now, but by all means, if we're in battle, put me in coach.", "David: Literally, in the Hill School interview, he says, \"You got to ask yourself, are you a wartime fighter or not?", "And I've always gotten my biggest thrills being in the fight.\" Then of course, there's the Carl Icahn battle, the price wars, and all the stuff that happens at Netflix.", "He ended up staying until 2010. Many more years than he originally expected.", "When he finally does announce that he is leaving Netflix in 2010, he could totally retire at this point.", "He's in his mid-50s and he announces it at an investor conference. This is also amazing, amazing quote here.", "He's telling the street, \"You can infer from the record in 2004 that I wouldn't be leaving unless things were in very good shape.", "There is nothing that I know that you don't know that would cause you to be sleepless about your position in the stock.\"", "Barry is saying that you can take that to the bank, and then Ben, to what you were saying, this is also from the Hill School interview about him really getting fired up by wartime and peacetime is not as interesting to him.", "The headmaster asked, why did he leave Netflix? He says, \"I got bored. The more successful the business was, the fewer the challenges there were for me.\"", "Ben: Fascinating. Listeners, as you can tell, we're spending a lot of time here on Barry in part because I think it's really important to know, as we think about the future of Peloton, what is his MO, who is this guy, and to the extent where you're excited about the future of the company, why and what's the track record of this person?", "What's he likely to do when he comes in? Of course, he has an amazing way of instilling confidence. He has a way with words and especially a way with words to investors to bring a sense of calm.", "I think there's nothing more necessary for Peloton than that right now.", "David: I think the other thing, that's one half of the magic of Barry McCarthy. To the extent, he has magic, which I believe he does.", "I think the other half is what he learns from this Netflix experience and frankly, going all the way back to Music Choice before that, and then compounds with Spotify that we'll get into in a sec, which he is probably the number one world expert in managing subscription businesses.", "He helped architect the OG internet subscription business of Netflix, and then again, go back and listen to our episodes.", "So much of what he was doing during those wartime years was modeling out in incredibly precise detail, the economics of not only what Netflix's subscription business was, but Blockbusters and what Amazon could do.", "They had to make decisions with the whole company on the line about how low they were going to cut prices and how long they were going to hold them low to fight Blockbuster and Amazon.", "They had to understand the financing ability of those two other companies in addition to their own and their access to capital for how they were going to win that war.", "If there are other people in the world who have done this to the degree that he has, they're few and far between.", "Ben: He is in the dictionary under the definition of strategic finance.", "David: Yes, particularly subscription business strategic finance. When he retires from Netflix, he goes and joins TCV, which of course has a storied history of investing in Netflix and helping them through all of their challenges as a financing partner.", "Ben: We should say, TCV stands for Technology Crossover Ventures, which well it seems like everyone is doing this now investing in both private and public companies, this was a unique enough strategy when they were formed that they named themselves after it.", "That says a lot about how long TCV has been doing that.", "David: He joins them as a venture partner. I don't know if he was thinking that he was just going to be on boards and be an advisor for the rest of his career, but in 2014, he joined the Spotify board.", "He's sort of taken by both the Spotify business, Daniel Eck, and the opportunity ahead, and they need someone like him to really come and transform that business.", "We should revisit Spotify at some point because when we covered their direct listing, which he architected, Barry modernized the direct listing and everything that's happening now.", "Ben: Yes, taking a page out of Ben and Jerry's playbook.", "David: Indeed, indeed. He goes and joins Spotify as CFO, and not just CFO but also eventually he would head their free business, the advertising supportive business at Spotify.", "Ben: Oh, I didn't realize he's like an operational leader of the ad-supported business.", "David: Originally, he moved to Stockholm and was CFO of the business in Stockholm, and then moved to New York to set up and really drive the free portion of the Spotify business, which is what Taylor was so upset about.", "Now since he took that over, they built that into a real business, working with artists, and making that actually work for the company and for all the stakeholders.", "He had this incredible chapter there, the DPO, everything. Then in January of 2020, he retires—presumably fully at this point in time because he's 66 years old—rejoins the board of Spotify, and thinks he's going to spend the next few years joining boards again.", "He joins the Instacart board and reestablishes his relationship with TCV.", "Ben: Didn't he also join the board of Pandora if I'm remembering right, speaking of music subscriptions?", "Ben: Okay, got it. Just to add yet another piece of credibility on music-related subscription businesses.", "David: Totally. Now let's switch over to the Peloton track of the story here. Peloton, as many folks probably know, was founded in 2012 by John Foley.", "Ben: David, I think it's inappropriate to start the Peloton story in 2012. I just have to say, I know you're usually the one who goes back.", "This story starts in 2006 with SoulCycle. Without going into the whole SoulCycle story, by the way, there are two awesome episodes of how I built this.", "One on SoulCycle with the founders there, and then another one actually interviewing John Foley on Peloton, which is great.", "We don't think about the narrative of Peloton that much this way right now, but if you think back to when you first heard about Peloton, it was SoulCycle but on a screen in your living room.", "SoulCycle was this massive dominant brand. If you were touchy-feely and then there was FlyWheel, which if you were more numbers-driven, FlyWheel was more your schtick.", "I guess it was more of a FlyWheel than a SoulCycle, but it had the prestige brand of a SoulCycle.", "David: I actually don't know the history on this, you may know, but there's the very intertwined history with SoulCycle and FlyWheel, right?", "Ben: There is. We will get to that and what would have happened otherwise.", "David: Okay, we'll save it for later. We'll save it for later", "Ben: It is totally inappropriate to think about Peloton in a vacuum. The moment in 2012, and I think even 2011 when there was ideation happening, was totally I'm John Foley, I live in New York.", "SoulCycle is totally taking off in this not yet connected fitness but sort of—", "Ben: High-end group Boutique Fitness that's taking the world by storm. Of course, there's John who's not really the most numbers-oriented, schedule-oriented, disciplined person, more a visionary, product-leader type person.", "He's thinking, I can't commit to five days from now making sure that I schedule that spot in SoulCycle.", "What if I could decide last minute and there was an infinitely scalable version of SoulCycle where the room wasn't bound by four walls?", "David: Totally. Well into who John is in a sec, but you're absolutely right to start with SoulCycle, Boutique Fitness, FlyWheel, Barry's boot camp, and all the other similar businesses out there.", "John and his wife Jill lived in New York, which is the epicenter of all of this, and there are so many great instructors at these places that have cult followings.", "People fly from all over the world to come to New York, that's where you want to be if you are an up-and-coming instructor in this burgeoning new care category.", "This is what's just brilliant, like you said, it's so hard to get spots in those classes. The instant they become available, you even had to do this in Seattle, I remember, but in New York it's impossible.", "Ben: It was a meme to buy the shirts and the shirt said noon on Monday because noon on Monday is when you had to stop whatever you're doing and scramble to reserve the spots.", "David: Anybody, it's hard to get spots with the best instructors in these classes. John and Jill, his wife, were super into this.", "They had two little kids. I've got one little kid. Obviously, we live in a different era now, but even if we didn't, there would be no way I could do this.", "There were a lot of people out there that just wanted this product and couldn't get access to it.", "The Peloton idea was revolutionary on a whole bunch of dimensions. One, it was a democratizing location.", "You didn't have to be in New York to get the best stuff. Two, was like you said, elastically scaling access to the best instructors, not the average instructors and low-quality instructors.", "Ben: If you think those vectors alone—infinite class size and geography agnostic—that's massively TAM expanding.", "Theoretically, the TAM for connected fitness should be way bigger than Boutique Fitness, but then there's even a third layer of icing on the cake, which is time-shifting.", "David: To feather back in preview, a little Barry element here, one of the things that he talks about—to the extent he does talk publicly—and learned deeply from Netflix but has just become kind of ingrained in him and I think is now an obvious insight but definitely at Netflix and at this point in time when Peloton was getting started not obvious.", "His quote is, \"Everything linear dies, everything on-demand wins,\" and it's so true.", "This element of being able to access the best in the world content on your schedule, when you want it, that's what makes Netflix awesome.", "That's what makes Spotify awesome. That's why podcasting is better than talk radio. That's why music streaming is better than listening on the radio.", "That's why Netflix is better than linear TV programming.", "Ben: Yeah, which is mostly true but not entirely true. Sports is probably the notable exception.", "David: Right. Barry always says sports is sort of the one. There are a few categories out there. Here's this concept being applied to a whole radically new market like fitness, who would have thought.", "It's absolutely brilliant and we can't give enough credit to Peloton and John Foley for innovating on this.", "Ben: In fact, you could even argue Slack is indicative of this trend. Work going async instead of synchronous.", "Pulling out of meetings and going to chat-based or document-based forms of collaboration. That is on-demandness of something that was previously linear.", "David: Totally. People still obviously have work phone calls and whatnot.", "Ben: The number of Slack conversations that used to be a meeting or the number of document reviews that used to be a meeting is just awesome.", "David: Yep. To then create a product that is native to that, email existed, but it's slow and it's not…", "Anyway, that's what Peloton was. Who's John Foley? It's such a small world out there. Prior to starting Peloton, he had been the head of Barnes & Noble's Nook business, their e-reader business, which is based in New York.", "Actually, Barnes & Noble was a great company and then eviscerated by Amazon. The Nook product, I think, was probably a decent product but it was just too late.", "Ben: They were really a fierce competitor in this market. They outlasted Borders.", "David: Totally. It's interesting too—thinking about the book and e-reader market relative to Peloton and maybe some lessons that Foley learned from that—you could have the best hardware in the world, but you needed the books.", "The content was what really mattered. It didn't matter if the Nook hardware was better than the Kindle or not.", "Amazon had the biggest selection of books, the easiest buying experience, and had the most lock-in.", "Ben: Okay, I do have to pull forward that thing from what would have happened otherwise because we can save that analysis for later, but I should share what actually happened.", "You might be giving Foley a little bit too much credit here. When he was starting the business, they wanted to build the best bike, a beautiful piece of hardware like Apple.", "They wanted to build software that was equally elegant and really differentiated that bike.", "The original vision actually was a connect your own iPad vision. They did not want to unify it but sort of learned over time that we really do need to unify it to control more of the experience.", "But here's the interesting thing, they actually didn't want to produce their own content. They thought if we have a bike, even if it's a bike with our software, that's interesting enough to people and we can partner with either SoulCycle or Peloton.", "Ben: Or FlyWheel, yeah, to get access to their instructors and their content. That's the thing they're good at is the content.", "We'll just make this elegant device, and they actually got to a term sheet with FlyWheel. I think SoulCycle sort of gave them the cold shoulder as they were so hot at the time, so big, and so dominant.", "FlyWheel actually got to terms on what it would look like to make this thing not only a content partner", "but I think also a go-to-market partner. This was going to be the distribution strategy, but FlyWheel ended up pulling out and walking away from the deal.", "Peloton was forced to do their own content and pivot to a really vertically integrated strategy.", "David: Oh my gosh, talk about history turning on the knifepoint. Wow, just like the echoes of the Blockbuster-Netflix situation and Amazon.", "David: Ah, amazing. Okay, so that's what Foley was doing immediately before starting Peloton. But before that he had been a long-time IAC guy, InterActiveCorp., working for Barry Diller.", "Ben: The original tech media conglomerate. I'm kind of annoyed at the number of people that tried to characterize John Foley as someone who was breaking into the industry or didn't have a tech background.", "No, he was in the middle of this stuff in the late ‘90s, early 2000s.", "David: We should do an episode on IAC because it is fascinating. Barry Diller, media, tech, and him being really the first person to integrate all that.", "For a long time, sort of the jewel of IAC was QVC and the Home Shopping Network. What is that? That is literally streamed media out via television with an interactive component that people at home were buying, calling.", "David: I believe he was working on part of the city search team and then they had a business called pronto.com.", "I'm not sure exactly what that was doing, but he had bounced around. I think a lot of people that I see go between a whole bunch of their properties.", "Ben: Yup, and I'm not sure if this was IAC or his next gig, but he ended up taking over the post-bubble Evite team that had shrunk from like hundreds and hundreds of people down to this very small group.", "I think he grew it from $1 million to $25 million in revenue or something. Still relatively small compared to the grander scale, but had sort of done this take a startup, rehab it, and build it bigger.", "He hadn't actually done a startup from scratch but had built something meaningful with a small team.", "David: Man, Evite, that's like the cockroach of the internet, in a good way. It just won't die. Amazing.", "You would think, gosh, we're telling this story now, in hindsight, it's 2020. Incredible vision, proven demand for this product.", "Yes, it's going to be hard to build a full-stack company around this, but financing hard stuff, that's what builds moats.", "Ben, as you referenced John's episode on How I Built This is great around all this so we won't rehash all of it.", "It was incredibly hard to get this funded. All the VCs passed again and again and again. He ends up raising $400,000 to start from friends and family at a $2 million post-money valuation.", "Oh my gosh. And of course, folks probably all know now, I think it's later in my notes maybe what the current market cap of Peloton is, but at its peak, it was a $45 billion public company.", "Ben: IPO'd at $8 billion, went all the way up to (I think) $49 billion, and then today is floating a little above the IPO price between $9 billion and $10 billion.", "David: Wow. From a $2 million post-money valuation for that first round. That's 20% of the company he sold for $400,000", "Ben: Yeah, all from individuals, $25,000 and $50,000 checks.", "David: Then did a $3.5 million round I believe also all from individuals after that. They did a Kickstarter in 2013.", "Ben: I can't believe this thing was a Kickstarter.", "David: Until I pointed out in the Acquired Slack. It was a Kickstarter and it was like essentially a failed Kickstarter.", "Ben: Yes. Here's the thing, I just pulled it up. We'll link to the Kickstarter page in the show notes, which by the way has basically the bike exactly as it is today on their from eight years ago.", "David: Aside from the weights holders and they tweaked—", "Ben: Yeah. They raised $307,332 on Kickstarter. Their goal was $250,000 and John says on the How I Built This episode that half the people who backed the Kickstarter were already investors.", "It's a very interesting thing here where we all know Peloton is a killer product. You and I rave about it.", "They have these ludicrous NPS scores, and yet, when they laid out the vision and they showed a very well-produced video, you get a sense of what the experience is like from this video, it was not enough to communicate to people that this thing is going to be awesome.", "I think it's worth pointing out that until you actually tried it, you didn't know it was going to be good, which makes it a pretty hard thing to sell.", "David: Totally. We're going to get into this more in a sec. At least in the early days, things may be different now, although maybe not, we'll discuss.", "This product is not something you can really just sell over the internet. Like you said, you either got to try it or you got to have a bunch of friends who are using it and be like, this is awesome.", "Ben: Right. There needs to be sufficient social pressure or your own experience.", "David: Let's go right into, how do they start and end up selling it? They make, especially at that point in time, completely orthogonal decisions to how tech companies and startups were supposed to sell.", "They go to the Short Hills Mall in New Jersey, rent a store in the mall, set up a mall store, and start selling these by hand in the mall.", "Ben: It's a beautiful contrarian bet to say our strategy is to go to malls, which by the way, they continued to do.", "Hundreds and hundreds of in-mall stores as malls across America are declining, but they did have the realization—I don't know if it was super explicit as a strategy, but the realization—that hey, until you try this thing, you actually don't understand how awesome it is.", "You can hear it described to you, but it's not compelling enough to buy, especially at this high $2000 bike plus a subscription fee price point.", "They have these anecdotes about how people actually weren't in the market to go buy gym equipment, but they're walking by, they try it, they have someone size the bike for you, and you throw in the headphones.", "Their KPI is to get you in the experience as soon as possible after stepping in the store. This is, by the way, how I bought mine.", "Ben: I did, yeah, I had intent beforehand, but it is this experience where they're like, do you want to try it, and they make it easy and fun to try.", "Then once you're in and you've got headphones on, and typically people are together, so you look at your partner or whoever, and then you're like, whoa.", "It takes all three to five minutes before you're like, oh, I see why this could be cool. They needed the mall store as the way to do this.", "David: I'm just remembering my own experience before I bought the Peloton, which I didn't get until this summer.", "It was not like a pandemic purchase per se, but I had been hearing from you and plenty of my friends how much they love it for years, and that wasn't even enough to put me over the edge.", "I got a digital subscription. I had a crappy old bike in my garage that I was using it with. I was like, oh, this is pretty good.", "Then we went on vacation, we went on a babymoon before our daughter was born and the hotel had Peloton there and I was like, well, I'll see what the actual bike is like.", "I was like, oh, this is awesome and my $200 Amazon bike in the garage, it's night and day compared to this.", "Ben: It really is a great bike. It's the sort of magnetic resistance, it's the belt instead of the chain.", "I mean everything about it is a nice piece of hardware.", "Ben: It's interesting you're describing how you got hooked into it. That's like, sure you want to sell bikes to hotels because it's nice to sell bikes, but I think a big part of we need to be in hotel strategy is just more and more ways for people to experience it and want to buy one.", "David: Yeah, okay, so you mentioned the price, $2000 bike. I think they priced it like $1500 on Kickstarter, I think.", "But then when they first tried to start selling these things, they priced it at $1200. This is a fascinating little detail.", "Then they talked to some people about this, you're getting customer feedback.", "What they realized was that for $1200 dollars, they're thinking like, hey, the strategy is to sell the hardware at cost or at a loss.", "It's like the video game console strategy. Get the video game consoles in there and then we've got this awesome subscription business that we're going to layer on top of it and that's where we're going to make our money.", "People thought the hardware couldn't be that great if it was $1200 and they realized that if they raise the price up to $2245, then in people's minds this becomes this jewel, premium, expensive, aspirational, luxury product.", "I'm treating myself to this splurge because it's so awesome and I'm going to love it. At the $1200 price point, it was hurting that, it was preventing that from happening.", "David: They didn't change a thing about the bike. They just raised the price by $1000 bucks.", "Ben: In the Buffett parlance of prices, what you pay value is what you get, they’re using the price to signal value.", "David: That's supposedly another one of the big things that really help sales take off.", "Ben: I'm going to pull forward a playbook theme here. The second-order thing that I don't think they realized by jacking up the price is that now they're picking their customers and they're picking affluent customers.", "In particular, they're picking customers who have extremely low price sensitivity.", "What happens when you pick people with extremely low price sensitivity and you select for only people who are willing to throw $2300 post-tax at an exercise bike, they're pretty unlikely to churn even if your fitness subscription is pretty expensive.", "Even to this day, their annual churn—if you take their monthly churn and annualize it—is something like 9%.", "This is an unbelievably sticky business. When you look at most consumer businesses they're like 50% annual churn.", "David: Yup, as of last summer, they're on a June 30 fiscal year when they reported the last full year fiscal end, I believe monthly churn was like 0.6%, which worked out to about 7% annual turn.", "Ben: I think it's meaningfully better than Netflix. I should look at what Netflix’s churn is, but I think that is the best I've ever seen.", "On the one hand, it's hard to acquire customers because you got to go sell them a $2400 bike. On the other hand, once you get them, boy is that sticky.", "David: I don't know what revenue was for 2014, which is their first kind of full year of sales and then they implemented some of these strategies.", "I believe it was $10 million. In 2015 though, they did $60 million of revenue, and ahead of that at the end of 2014, they're able to raise their first institutionally led round of capital.", "This is 2014 led by the legendary early-stage investor, just technically a Series B but the seed was the $400,000 round and then the A was still individual's $3.5 million round, led by the legendary seed investor.", "They are quite now a legendary seed investor, among others—Tiger Global. Get out of here. This is amazing.", "Ben: It's unbelievable that by Lee Fixel in 2014, it was a $10 million total round on a $35 million post where Tiger put in $5 million.", "Tiger would go on to become the largest shareholder at IPO owning just under 20% of the business.", "David: Amazing. There are so many little things about this story that just sort of presage everything that would be to come in tech over the years in venture.", "Ben: I do think, by the way, this is one of the things that gave—among many other very successful investments but was a big part of the story for Lee when he left and started Addition and raised over a billion dollars for Addition's first fund.", "David: For Lee, for Addition, and for Tiger itself too. Got to imagine that that was a big part. They're notoriously tight-lipped.", "Our friend Mario Gabriele wrote I think the best piece out there on them, which is still without insider access but shaped their strategy too.", "David: So $60 million in revenue in 2015. In 2016, they did $170 million in revenue. In 2017, they raised $325 million at a $1.3 billion valuation.", "This is where I think Silicon Valley really started to wake up and be like, oh my God, we missed this.", "David: Literally everyone. In 2018, they introduced the Tread product (the treadmill) and the digital app subscription.", "It'd be fun to talk about that. I started as a digital app subscriber.", "David: Yup. It was $12.99. I think I originally started because I think there might have been some deal with Apple like a free month trial or something like that.", "Ben: Were you a part of the COVID offering, the three-month COVID thing?", "Ben: That was totally nuts. John Foley talks about this at the beginning of COVID. He said, \"Six months ago, we had about 100,000 digital subscribers for that business.\"", "And within 45 days of COVID hitting, they gave this deal that said, you're not getting a month free, you get three months free because people need to work out at home.", "\"Within 45 days, we had close to 1.2 million people who had jumped on the trial. So… call it a 10x increase… In weeks.\"", "Ben: Again, we'll get into the unit economics of it later, but at least from a customer acquisition perspective, that was a great way to spike the number of subscribers they had.", "David: Totally. The digital app experience is surprisingly full-featured. I used just that for quite a number of months before I got to try the actual hardware at a hotel.", "Ben: For people who are wondering, why isn't it as good? If you haven't ridden the Peloton, why can't I just mount an iPad on an old exercise bike?", "The biggest difference is that when the bike is not feeding information into whatever device you're using—your iPad or something—it doesn't know what the resistance is and it doesn't know what your cadence is.", "You don't know things like your current spot on the leaderboard. It knows you're doing the ride and it knows how far into the ride you are, but it doesn't actually know anything about how you're doing in the ride.", "David: Leaderboard. I also think it is a really good bike. You can do a hack a Peloton and get some of the integrations with third-party sensors, but I think to get a similar quality bike, you're going to be spending roughly the same amount anyway.", "That's what I decided is like, well, I'll just get the whole ecosystem.", "Ben: Why wouldn't you get one anyway? Because the connected fitness digital-only subscription is $13 a month and once you have a bike, it becomes $40 a month.", "David: You're paying $40 a month. I know you've got some fun stuff on this. In 2019, everybody in Silicon Valley knows this is a great business now.", "People started talking about an IPO, going public, which happens in September 2019. Leading up to that, there's kind of an issue with the business they got to sort out.", "Earlier in 2019, they got sued for first $150 million and then they up it to $300 million by the National Music Publishers Association because they're obviously using all this music as part of the classes at Peloton and they didn't have the proper sync licenses.", "Ben: Yes. This is one of my larger bear cases for Peloton. Music licensing and gross margins are a treacherous tale.", "If you look at Peloton’s income statement today and across the recent quarters, we're at sort of a relative point of maturity here, about a third of the revenue that comes from subscription, not like the physical bike sales, but if you just look at the subscription revenue, a third of that goes to cost of revenue.", "While we don't know for sure, it's very likely that the majority of this goes to music licensing. Even though investors love a good subscription business, this is not 86% gross margin like SaaS is, it's more like 66% gross margins.", "A little examination, why do we think that this mostly goes to music? In part, the variable cost for everything else should be pretty low.", "Maybe bandwidth is probably the next highest cost for streaming video. I have some particular beef as a pedantic person with the video that they do stream.", "I find it to be too low frame rate, to have some motion blur, and to be a little bit compressed, but all that aside, it's still expensive to stream video.", "David: Did they put content production cost in variable cost here too?", "Ben: I don't know if that is in the cost of revenue for the subscription. I would guess not? I would guess they would put that down in either G&A?", "David: I don't know, I haven't dug enough to know, but I don't think it's that expensive relative to the amount of subscription revenue they get.", "We'll get into powers later, scale economies, and all that, but my understanding is that the top Peloton instructors make $500,000 to $1 million.", "David: Then obviously, you've got all the production costs around that, but still compared to hundreds of millions of subscription annual revenue, that's a drop in the bucket.", "Ben: Totally. Let's assume that the largest part of this 33% of the cost of revenue is to pay for music.", "Why is music so expensive? If you remember from our Taylor Swift episode, there are a bunch of different types of licenses.", "Ben: Unlike Spotify or the radio, Peloton actually requires multiple licenses for the particular way that they use the music.", "First, Peloton, I think, is technically just like the radio—a live performance. Live performance royalties must be paid out.", "If you are curious about how those are paid out, go listen to the Taylor Swift episode where we talk about the difference between the publishing rights holder and the performance master right holder.", "They also need a sync license in addition to synchronizing those songs with the video content, if you're going to use a license in—", "Ben: Exactly. Just as a quick aside (an aside from an aside) the interesting bit about sync licenses is they require the approval of both the songwriter—the person with the publishing right—and the performing artist whose label owns the master right.", "There's a lot of people who can say, no, I don't grant you a sync right, which is why in this lawsuit that you're referencing, David, when Peloton did end up pulling a bunch of stuff off of the service, which a lot of people were really upset about, it was weird because they were like, wait, but some of these artists' songs are on there and some rides with those artists' songs got removed and that's because those songs had different songwriters behind them.", "David: So many people with veto power, what a byzantine industry.", "Ben: Crazy, right? Okay, back to this gross margin problem. According to a piece from Trichordist, which is a music industry site, Peloton pays out 3.1¢ every time that you are on a ride and hear a song.", "That number should actually sound pretty high to you because that's meaningfully larger than what we talked about on the Taylor Swift episode per stream.", "Let's take that 3.1¢. If you ride every day, and people don't ride every day, but I think people ride about 20 days or they use the product about 20 times per month.", "Let's say you ride every day and assume there are about 10 songs per ride, and I went back through my recent rides and looked at that's about right, that's $9 of your subscription revenue that is going straight to music.", "If you're on the bike subscription, that’s 23% of your subscription that you're paying to Peloton goes immediately to the labels, which kind of checks our math above that the biggest part of that 1/3 of the cost of revenue is actually for music.", "Of course, if you're on the digital-only subscription, that's really high because if that's only $13 a month.", "If you're actually using that thing every day, I assume the royalty structure is similar. It may be the case that Peloton is large enough that they've negotiated a specific revenue share somewhere between 15%, 25%, 30%, or something like that with the music labels rather than needing to pay out a fixed amount per song because if it's a fixed amount per song, then they could get underwater pretty quick on that digital-only subscription.", "David: God, the parallels to Spotify are just amazing with the two different tiers of customer experiences and vastly different implications of that for their back-end costs.", "Ben: A hundred percent. Okay, you're leading the horse to water. I'm the horse, here's the water. Because there are very real marginal costs in this business just like Spotify, at the end of the day, this actually does have the same incentives that an old school gym membership, which is to sign you up, keep you subscribed, but really no incentives for you to actually go to the gym all the time.", "They want you to do the minimum amount to stay subscribed, stay engaged enough with us, but don't cost us any money.", "We want to minimize the amount that we have to pay the music labels on your behalf, which is interesting.", "I was thinking about this. I'm preparing for the episode and I slept on it. When I woke up this morning, I realized, because they're bragging about all their earning stuff increasing user engagement over time and having internal KPIs around, we want people to use the service, I came to the conclusion that they have to have a pre-negotiated revenue split with the music labels rather than paying per stream.", "because Peloton could end up in a really tough position if their own incentives are for you to stay subscribed but not ride.", "I bet they did some kind of blanket license type thing where 20%, 25%, or whatever it is ends up of all subscription revenue no matter what ends up going to the labels.", "David: If they don't have that, they probably have a new CEO who could help make that happen.", "David: If they don't they should, and now they probably can.", "Ben: Yes. One last quick piece of math just to underscore the gravity of this. I ran the math on what it would cost Spotify to pay the labels for the same amount of music listening time based on the data that we used in the Taylor Swift episode.", "Fifteen hours across a month—so I was thinking the same as a 30-minute ride every day for a month—and instead of the $9 that I estimated that Peloton has to pay, Spotify is closer to $1.20.", "Ben: That sync right, and the performance licenses—very expensive. Barry is definitely used to this Spotify world of, we pay a pittance to the labels and the artists.", "In this world, because of the licensed structure, it's a meaningful part of cogs.", "David: One way to look at it is the meaningful part of cogs and in the bear lens. Another way to look at it is artists should really embrace Peloton.", "Ben: Yes, very much so, which you got to wonder, is that part of what's driving the Taylor ride series and the Beyonce ride series.", "Peloton is notoriously very collaborative with the most popular artists.", "David: September 2019, they've settled this lawsuit, they figured things out, at least with the sync licenses.", "They go public, the IPO happens. As one hits fiscal year 2019, so fiscal year ends June 30th, as I've said.", "For the 12 months leading up to June 30, 2019, it did revenue of $915 million. For a product that's been in the market for five years, that is impressive.", "That is up over 100% from $435 million the year before.", "Of that $915 million, $181 million is subscription revenue, which is up from $80 million the year before, so growing even faster.", "We already talked about the margins on the subscription revenue. Interestingly, the hardware revenue—Connected Fitness products is the segment they call it—also about a 40% gross margin.", "Ben: Right, they actually make pretty good margins on selling the bike itself. I couldn't find this mostly because I was scrambling for just the last day to put together everything we did learn.", "If you have data on this, please come and share it with us, acquire.fm/slack, and we would love to talk about this.", "I remember around the time of their IPO seeing some analysis that said that they basically were breakeven on the bike if you add in customer acquisition costs.", "The cost of manufacturing the bike, delivering it, and all that plus the cost to acquire, which was really expensive—they're in these malls, they're sending you a ton of social media ads, they're really trying to convince you.", "They're putting on Superbowl commercials, which we'll get to, they're putting on other commercials where people are in these multimillion-dollar homes riding in fancy places, it's expensive to convince people to do this new behavior.", "I think the plan at the time was like, okay, just don't lose money acquiring a customer when we sell them a bike.", "As long as we're breakeven on that, then we can make a lot of money on the subscriptions.", "David: I actually did do a little modeling on this. Don't take this as gospel because I'm mixing time periods here and it's hard to know exactly.", "This is not a sharp pencil, this is back of the envelope modeling. These are pandemic numbers, so it may not be applicable anymore.", "But in the most recent full fiscal year, which ended June 30, 2021, they spent $730 million on sales and marketing and they added about $1.4 million gross adds on subscribers.", "I'm assuming that all those are bikes, obviously not. A lot of those are digital subscriptions, et cetera, but let's just make it simple.", "CAC on that is $521 per gross subscriber added. That is, to your point, a lot of money. That is a lot.", "It is a very, very high CAC—$521 per new subscriber.", "Ben: Not in the B2B world, but it's almost unheard of in B2C. On getting a consumer, paying $500 for a consumer, no one does this.", "David: If you go out and put that in your pitch deck around Silicon Valley, you're going to have to have a very high LTV.", "At the $1895 price point for the bike, which is what it was until they started doing crazy stuff with their pricing, but they had lowered it from the $2245 to $1895, at a 40% gross margin on that hardware, that's $758.", "Ben: Right. They're making a little, maybe $100, a couple of $100 total on each bike.", "David: Yup, they're making some amount of contribution margin on the bike. But then you attach the subscription, which with the crazy low churn rates that they have, the implied lifetime is over 10 years.", "David: Right. Let's cap it at five years for customer lifetime because 10 years is too crazy. Let's assume that that's not going to happen.", "At $40 a month, that's $2340 in subscription revenue over five years.", "David: It's a pretty dang good business. Interestingly, the IPO happens right after the whole WeWork debacle, which we covered on this show with Dan Primack—also a big Peloton fan—at the time, that was fun.", "The IPO is not a good one. Prices around $8 billion, but then trades down 11% on opening to a $7.2 billion market cap.", "We're talking 7x trailing 12 months revenue, but this company is growing over 100% a year, so 3x forward revenue with pretty good unit economics that we just discussed, interesting.", "Ben: Yeah, and this is in an era too where you don't have a lot of busted IPOs. This is before COVID, but it was still pretty go-go times for these tech businesses.", "A little disconcerting that they've traded down from their IPO price.", "David: Indeed, and then they don't really help things. Shortly after the IPO when the holiday season, 2019 rolls around.", "Ben: Wait, before we get to the Peloton ad, can you give me the numbers again on the cost to acquire customers and their LTV just because I want to hold that in my head as we continue through here?", "David: Okay, so rough, rough numbers, $500, $520 to acquire a customer. Let's say they are breakeven to slightly profitable on that with the hardware and then $2340 of lifetime revenue, assuming a five-year customer lifetime.", "David: That's revenue, so then 2/3 of that per your analysis is contribution.", "Ben: Okay, so we're looking at something in the neighborhood of $1500 of contribution on the subscription even if we cap it at five years.", "Every single person they acquire, not only are they breakeven or probably a little profitable just by selling them a bike, but then they make another $1500+ in pure profit by retaining them over time.", "David: Yup. You understand why this company, management, and the board would be like, we should advertise.", "Ben: Yes. We should go and pull forward as many new customers as we can. We should take out an infinite amount of debt—not that they did this—but we should raise an infinite amount of money so that we can spend on marketing, so that we can go get as many people to buy this thing and get hooked on it because", "David: Thus we end up with the holiday 2019 Peloton wife commercial, which is a funny story. Did it end up being bad for Peloton or is this just good marketing in the end?", "Ben: I think it was good marketing. I think it's good for everyone. It ends up being good for that actress.", "Ben: Oh my God, the Aviation Gin thing that came out the next week is just genius. We'll link to it, but people, go google Peloton wife Aviation Gin and watch that commercial.", "I also thought the Peloton wife commercial thing was pretty overblown. It feels like every year, stuff gets more and more insane.", "This commercial at the time, I think, had a lot of people up in arms, but this is not that scandalous.", "David: Yeah, right, compared to everything that's happened since. Also, it was probably great for Peloton because I didn't go back and watch it, but my recollection of it—put the controversy aside—is that the commercial itself was like, eh, fine, but then they got so much hype out of it.", "Ben: But this sets Peloton's track record for, they can become a dominant trending topic in a pop culture-y way, which every time they would come to dominate headlines after this, it's not really good for them.", "Other than the one which is like, hey, now that the pandemic hit, Peloton has perfect product-market fit.", "But every single one other than that, which we're about to talk about—the shipping delays and the treadmill recall—basically was never good again.", "Ben: All right, David, tell everyone why I was the most fortunate person in the world to, in January 2020, have just so happened to have bought a Peloton at that moment in history.", "David: I didn't realize you bought it before the pandemic.", "Ben: I bought that and my car in January of 2020, totally randomly and by happenstance, which both ended up being unbelievable assets to have.", "David: I actually bought an Olympic weight set off Craigslist right at the same time, so not as high value as you, but stuff that immediately became unavailable.", "I think it's $180 maybe for a full Olympic weight set. It was awesome.", "David: Yeah, so great. The pandemic hits, like you said, if Peloton had very good product-market fit with a certain narrow customer segment before the pandemic was a great business.", "The pandemic made it have instant product-market fit with many, many more segments. They add roughly a million subscribers in the next year's revenue.", "In the fiscal year ended June 30th, 2020 is $1.8 billion. In the fiscal year ended June 30th, 2021 is $4 billion.", "The stock trades up, as we've talked about, to a peak of over $150 per share at a $49, I believe, billion market cap.", "People think this is going to the moon and rightly so. It's an amazing product. If fitness has now become fully digital, they are the leader in the category.", "Ben: There are zillion copycats, not just in the NordicTrack and Target making black and red bikes and making Peloton-like sounding names for them.", "Ben: It's crazy. But also pioneering this category of connected fitness, which says, sure, Peloton is going to do a tread and a bike, but they're not going to do a mirror, band-based weight set, and yoga.", "All these brands that are saying, yeah, Peloton does a little bit of that, but that's not their core competency and they're never going to take it seriously.", "There really is this super real category of connected fitness that Peloton totally pioneered.", "David: I'm curious about your thoughts. Connected fitness, both within the Peloton suite of products and competitors, is it a broad thing or is this something that just works really, really well for spin classes?", "Ben: Great question. I've done a bunch of the Peloton strength stuff. I think that works well and I think that the Peloton strength classes definitely appeal to a crowd who is not going to buy an Olympic weight set in their garage or is not going to go to a gym.", "I know people with the Mirror who are very happy with that. I think it's pretty broad. I think the bike is the first and best instantiation of it.", "Interestingly, fully, and I think he's right on this, this isn't one of his grandiose statements that end up not being true.", "He thinks that the tread market is 3x what the bike market is because running is much more—treadmills are a bigger thing, I think, than stationary bikes.", "David: They also sell the treadmill for a lot more money.", "David: It's interesting. The running one, it's different. I'm sort of halfway in between on this. I agree with you.", "I both have an Olympic weight set in my garage, but I use the Peloton strength stuff more often, especially as I get a little older and the idea of squatting and bench pressing is less appealing to me.", "I think the strength stuff is pretty good, but I can't imagine buying a treadmill or using connected fitness for running.", "David: We're lucky we live on the West Coast. We can run outside year-round. There are plenty of places where that's not possible.", "Ben: Yeah. It says a lot that, ultimately, all connected fitness is a digital facsimile of a real-world experience.", "There was a very, very popular real-world experience of spin classes. It's interesting that that behavior never really existed in the real world for running.", "There's like Barry's Bootcamp, but that is not sweeping—part of it is, like a third of it is or half of it is.", "But there's not a sweeping international movement the way that there was with spin where it's running to an instructor.", "Ben: Maybe to super simplify my answer to your question, it's anything that's instructor-led that is a big market in the offline world can be an instructor-led large market in connected fitness.", "David: I agree with that. Maybe there will be some innovation at some point that isn't an instructor-led running class.", "But as a runner, I don't really want an instructor. The joy of running to me is to be outside in beautiful places and just go.", "Ben: You have a bias there. I'm the exact same type of runner, but the hardcore cyclists wouldn't say the same thing.", "They're like a spin class, but the beauty of cycling is that, you know…", "David: Right, and then the beauty of spin class is like, these are two different products.", "David: Anyway, September of 2020. This is where, I think, things start to get a little wonky with Peloton.", "Ben: We should say, by September of 2020, it's basically impossible to get one of the Peloton bikes at all.", "There's a four-month backlog. Pandemic hits and unless you're getting one in the first week or two, you're out months before you can get one because Peloton doesn't make any of their own bikes.", "They certainly don't make any in the US, so we're at the whim of international shipping and supply chain partners.", "They really haven't ramped any in-house manufacturing capability, so good luck.", "David: Right, which makes all of this even a little more puzzling. You would think a reaction to that would be to raise prices.", "Certainly, they have total pricing power. Now, to their philosophy and we've been talking about they want as many people to access Peloton as possible, blah blah blah.", "Okay, great. They introduced the Bike+. They priced it at $2495. The original bike, remember, had been $2245.", "Ben: David, you bought a Bike+ so you know the differences of this product firsthand.", "David: They lowered the price of the original bike to $1895. Why would you lower the price of this right now?", "There's insane demand for it. And why would you introduce the Bike+ at only $2495 when you're selling treadmills for $3000, $4000+.", "Clearly, there's an appetite for your core segment to buy expensive products here and they're not that price sensitive.", "The Bike+, when I decided to buy a Peloton, I don't know if my experience is universal, but I was like, you know what, I'm really going to invest in this.", "This is awesome. I want the best. I'm going to buy a Bike+. I didn't even really think about pricing or how much it was relative to the bike.", "It arrived. I got to say, this is only my experience, it was a super crappy product.", "David: Yeah, I thought it was actually a worse product than the bike and cost more, and many of the key features were irrelevant.", "The auto follow feature, it'll auto change the resistance to the instructor. I never actually want my resistance exactly what the instructor has.", "Ben: Not to mention, there's a bigger screen but it's the same resolution, so it's actually a lower DPI on the screen, which as someone who already has beef with the video quality, would drive me up a wall.", "David: I was going to get to that last, but yeah. A few other things like my garage is a little bit sloped and the Bike+, the front only has two feet and it was impossible for me to align it.", "Whereas the regular bike has three feet in front and is way easier to stabilize. There's just a whole bunch of really weird little things like that.", "Ben: The main gimmicky feature is you can flip the screen out sideways so you can do these boot camp rides where you're on the floor for part of it, you're on the bike for part of it.", "David: Yeah, (a) I don't use that that much. Usually, when I'm doing strength, I'm doing strength and when I'm doing the bike, I'm cycling.", "But (b) there's a $40 little bracket you can buy—that I did—for the original bike that you can install pretty easily to then have the screen flip.", "It's like, wait, why would I pay $1000 more for that?", "Anyway, what you said about the screen, that was the dagger for me where I was like, this is the worst experience because they have a bigger screen but they're using the same 1080p crappy video on it and it looks way worse.", "It just didn't make any sense to me. I returned the Bike+. Now let's think about me as a customer for Peloton.", "Ben: By the way, I love that in these episodes where we have personal experience like half the Airbnb episode was my experience as a host.", "David: People are probably like, this is irrelevant. But no, I think this is illustrative of some of the problems with Peloton.", "The product was not quite right. The pricing was weird that they did with the product suite here. They rolled a truck to do the delivery for me as a customer for the Bike+.", "Ben: And that they own all their own distribution and they're driving around neighborhoods all over America.", "David: Yup. They rolled a truck—in old cable parlance, a truck roll for customer service—they installed the Bike+ for me.", "The shoes that came with it the cleats didn't fit. They had to send me new cleats. All right, that's another shipping cost, customer service call, et cetera.", "I used the Bike+ and then I'm like, this is not that good. I returned it because they have a 30-day return policy.", "They rolled a truck to pick it up. I bought the original bike, which by that point in time, the price had dropped to $1495.", "I had spent $2495. They've rolled the truck twice already. Now I just spent $1000 less. I got the bike, they rolled a truck.", "There were some problems with the pedal. They've rolled the truck to do another customer service for me.", "Four truck rolls—a purchase, a return, a restocking, mailing me new cleats.", "Ben: Wow, they're probably not profitable on you until maybe year three as a subscriber.", "David: Absolutely. It's brutal. I can't imagine that my experience is wholly unique here.", "Ben: I wonder. We only had the person come out once and it all, thankfully, worked really well.", "David: I'm a very happy customer. But yeah, to your point, how long do they have to retain me to even break even on me now?", "David: I think a lot of these could have been avoided with some different product decisions and some different pricing decisions.", "Ben: There is a trend that they need to follow over the entire lifetime of their business, which is dropping the price point so they can keep attracting that next concentric circle out from the core affluent customer.", "If they're actually interested in continuing to grow the business, they need to do that. But even though that's true over a long period of time, this probably wasn't the right time in history to do that.", "Given what happened with the pandemic and with demand, and let's not talk about supply chain, inventory, and stuff yet because I think that made their business really not resilient—all the things that they did there—but they probably should have (easy to say in hindsight) not shipped the Bike+ and not dropped prices yet, even though they know they need to do both of those things in the longer term.", "David: Yeah. The Bike+ was a product that needed more work before shipping. Then in terms of cannibalization of their existing customer base, I think they really hurt themselves a lot on some of the aspirational aspects of the Peloton brand around this.", "Also, simple things like the bikes that the instructors use in the classes are the original bikes. If they really want to push the bike, why don't they use the pluses?", "David: I thought that was so weird. I don't think that hurts anything, and that's just great merchandising for higher margin products.", "Ben: I wonder if there's custom software that's written for instructor bikes that they didn't want to invest in porting to the new Bike+.", "David: That could be. Anyway, there's just a bunch of puzzling decisions here. Perhaps the most puzzling is in December 2020, they announced that they're buying Precor for $420 million in cash.", "Ben: In cash. And you and I both went and looked this up because we were like, I remember the $420 million Precor acquisition, which is a Washington-based company, by the way.", "Ben: Yup. And I was hoping they use some stock to pay for it given their stock was trading ludicrously high at the time.", "But alas, they spent the rare assets they have on hand there, the cash, and primarily bought Precor for their manufacturing prowess to have some US-based manufacturing to alleviate the supply chain stuff and to just have in house capacity because at some point, maybe they want to take this fully in-house.", "A secondary benefit that comes with it is Precor is really, really good at selling in commercial distribution channels.", "Peloton then can inherit all those relationships with all the hotels to get more Pelotons in there and eventually maybe merge these two product lines.", "But for now, they're running it as a totally separate independent business unit and starting to do some work leveraging Precor's manufacturing to hopefully start manufacturing some Peloton bikes.", "David: Right. That feels like a pipe dream, either a pipe dream or a very, very far out investment idea that you would retool Precor's manufacturing to manufacture bikes.", "The commercial relationships, that makes a little more sense to me so it was a little puzzling at the time.", "Then they announced in the spring of 2021 that they are going to build the Peloton Output Park to insource their own manufacturing in Ohio.", "Ben: This is now both of my homes they're trying to manufacture in.", "David: That's right. We'll come back to that in a bit.", "Ben: But that's another $400 million that they announced they're breaking ground on.", "David: Yup. Again, cash outlays. Then in the spring of 2021, there's the treadmill recall and some of the tragic accidents with the treadmill.", "The company doesn't handle that super well. At first, they sort of say, oh, you people aren't using it right.", "It's like, well, kids are dying and getting hurt here, that doesn't matter. Stock drops 15% around that.", "Ben: They issued a mea culpa and say, you know what, we are going to play ball with the investigation.", "We feel super bad that we mishandled this originally.", "David: Then in November of 2021, last fall, they missed earnings, they cut their outlook, and the stock got hammered—down 32% in one day with the earnings announcement.", "They have some more holiday season media commercials. This is also probably good with the new Sex and the City where Mr. Big dies on a Peloton.", "Ben: No, because that tanked their stock price and it never recovered.", "David: It did. Although that, to me, feels like the wrong reason to sell the stock.", "Ben: Yeah, but when something like that happens, so someone died on Sex and the City and it was on a Peloton and Peloton stock dropped, and you might say, that's so stupid.", "But I think what to read into that is people are on such uneasy footing about the future prospects of this company that merely imagining that something like that could happen is enough to spook investors, and that says a lot.", "David: That says way more than the Sex and the City episode. Yes. Then the other shoe drops, the other cycling cleat drops.", "On January 20th, news came out that supposedly, Peloton is completely stopping production of new hardware as they have an inventory glut that they can't sell.", "Demand has completely dried up. It all got pulled forward through the pandemic. This is bad news.", "Ben: There's a $1.3 billion worth of inventory that they're sitting on now.", "David: Yeah. We went from literally, they can't make this stuff fast enough. They're hiring delivery teams all across the country and around the world delivering bikes into people's homes, picking them up, servicing them, and bringing them back to now they can't sell these things.", "Ben: There are a lot of things to applaud the management team, John Foley, the doggedness, the entrepreneurism, the pure invention of a movement, recognizing talent, hiring the right instructors, finding ways to align incentives, and building this—like so much.", "The one that is really, really damning is all the quotes that Foley and other folks gave along the way saying, sure this pulled forward demand, but we think it will only ever be more.", "We think we will only ever continue to sell more and more of this stuff. Demand is just going to keep growing, and they were just completely wrong.", "The incredible slowdown, the really, really scary slowdown that has happened for them is to the point where they only grew 9% in Q4 and then 5% in revenue in Q1.", "This company just believed that there was way, way, way more demand out there. Sure, the pandemic accelerated us, but we're not going to have to make up for everything that was pulled forward.", "It's just going to continue to be high demand from here and they were just flat out wrong.", "David: Totally flat out wrong. We'll wrap up the few last points to bring us to literally today, present day.", "But one of the things, when they released earnings yesterday, is they cut guidance. Guidance had been for full fiscal year revenue of $4-$4.5 billion.", "They cut it down to $3.7 to $3.8 billion, which is actually going to be down. Revenue is going to be down sequentially year-on-year this year versus last year.", "That is not good. That is not good for a growth company.", "Ben: No. And you look at the level of certainty that they had—that they just needed to keep expanding to service all this demand—not only did they plunk over $800 million into manufacturing capacity between Precor, which is its own business so it's justifiable, assuming they paid a reasonable price for it and of course the Ohio factory.", "But you look at their employees, they were growing employees pretty quickly from 2015, 2016 to 2020. As of January 2021, they had 4000 employees.", "That ballooned over the next year to about 9000 before these recent layoffs.", "David: This is a very complex business, but 9000 employees—and that's just corporate, right?", "Ben: Yeah, and the layoffs, of course, were 2800 people across the whole business and I think about 20% of the corporate staff.", "But they were really, really investing and very certain the demand was there.", "David: Yup. After that news on January 20th, a couple of weeks later, an activist investor called Blackwells Capital comes out and announces that they've accumulated a 5% stake in Peloton.", "The share price and market cap, of which by the way, have dropped below the IPO price, which as we chronicled was not a great IPO in and of itself.", "And they published a deck calling for Foley to resign and for the company to initiate a strategic sale process.", "That brings us to yesterday, February 8th, 2022, where they announced earnings—they're bad. They lowered guidance significantly.", "They pulled the plug on Peloton Output Park. They canceled the plans to build a manufacturing facility in Ohio, they laid off 2800 people, and Barry McCarthy is writing in as the new CEO.", "Ben: The way they sort of message this is that John Foley is stepping down as CEO, which is the...", "Ben: That's what people hear. It's somewhat to appease these activist investors. But let's zoom in on what mechanically is actually happening here.", "Now, what an executive chairman is as compared to a non-executive chairman is they're still the chairman of the board or the chairperson of the board.", "They no longer have day-to-day responsibility running the company. However, I believe they still are compensated employees.", "They still draw a salary, they're still an employee of the company in addition to being just a board member.", "They share both this director-level and pseudo-operational. It's more like they're working with the current CEO to set a strategy with them.", "While they're not running the day-to-day, they are still the senior-most person who is an employee of the company.", "I don't think it would be correct to say that John Foley is currently Barry McCarthy's boss, but it totally is fair to say that John Foley is on the board, is the chairman of the board.", "The board hires and fires the CEO— and here's the real kicker on this whole thing—as many of you will know, we've been on a heck of a run over the last 20 years of having dual-class structures put in place for founder-led companies.", "Here's a quote from Matt Levine at Bloomberg, \"Peloton has a dual-class structure in which the founders and some insiders have stock with 20 votes per share, and Foley has a lot of it; according to Peloton’s proxy statement, he controls 39.6\", so right around 40%, \"of the voting power of Peloton's stock, and his co-founders… own another 18%.\"", "David: There you go. That's over 50% of the voting power of the company right there.", "Ben: Right. Foley can't do it alone, but with certainly both of his other co-founders, basically, can make a unilateral decision.", "The message Peloton wants Blackwells and other upset shareholders to hear is John Foley has moved on, stepped down as CEO, and we've brought in Barry McCarthy.", "David: It's more complicated. All that is true. At the same time, I don't think Barry would take this job if he didn't feel like he had full autonomy.", "David: And the memo that he writes to staff, which we've already read from some of it and I want to read a bit more because it's amazing.", "Barry is like, who wouldn't want to work for Barry?", "David: What a leader. He writes, \"I know today’s restructuring news has been difficult. There’s no sugar-coating it.", "It’s a bitter pill and, in my experience, the sting has a long half-life. But the hard truth is either revenue had to grow, or spending had to shrink.", "The math simply didn’t work otherwise, and the status quo was unsustainable. One of my core management principles is about getting real.", "We have to be willing to confront the world as it is, not as we want it to be if we’re going to be successful.", "We have to be honest with ourselves and with each other in order to make that happen, even when the truth is uncomfortable or inconvenient to deal with.\"", "Ben, I think you read the great part about the comeback story after that. Then he closes.", "When he closes the memo, he says, \"In the months ahead, you can expect to hear from me about our strategy and the choices we’re planning to make to drive our success.", "For the avoidance of doubt, we’re in the business of driving growth.\" That's like a full stop. That is what we are here to do.", "\"And that will require us to take risks, to be willing to fail quickly, to learn quickly, to adapt and evolve quickly, rinse and repeat.", "I promise that journey won't be dull. I look forward to working with you, Barry.\"", "Ben: Of course, this is after he opens by talking about how much he loves riding with Matt Wilpers. It is great and he opens the whole memo.", "The whole memo is kicked off with rather than like, hi, I'm your new CEO, it's, boy, do I love riding with Denis Morton and Matt Wilpers.", "I think he says like, who doesn't yet know me from Adam, which is pretty funny thinking about the fact that they're reading this email.", "David: Barry has no social media presence. He's basically not on the internet.", "Ben: You got to wonder, has he met any of the instructors yet too? Probably not.", "David: Probably not before yesterday at the earliest.", "David: I wonder what the instructors think of all this because they've built such brands. The Instagram following and the Twitter following of the top instructors is like, they have immense power.", "Ben: Emma Lovewell and Ally Love, they're getting up close to a million followers.", "Ben: And they've all parlayed this and other things too. Ally is the in-arena host for the Brooklyn Nets or at least was last year.", "Everyone's got Noom deals or Under Armour deals. Even though they're making $500,000 to a million from Peloton in salary or whatever their contract is, I bet they're making a lot more from their other engagements.", "David: Yeah, they're like professional athletes. The earning power from endorsement and other deals is way higher.", "All right, so there we are on this. We thought this would be short with the emergency pod on history and facts, but never underestimate Acquired.", "Ben: We're also incapable of just going on air unprepared. Of course, you and I, while we only had a day to do this, we kind of put together a full.", "There are so many more deep cuts in the history that we didn't go into like John and his friend prototyping the experience on a Disney Cruise.", "Ben: I'll pull that one out even though we skipped over it. John Pleasants, who got a big job at Disney, convinced Foley to come on a Disney Cruise with him.", "They're on this Disney Cruise and Foley rolls out a couple of spin bikes and stood there for the first 10 minutes of the ride coaching John Pleasants on what to do.", "Ben: Yeah, and being like, can you imagine there's a screen here? And really given him...", "David: And then Pleasants becomes one of the first angel investors in that $400,000 round, right?", "Ben: There is so much crazy lore in the building of Peloton, which I think we would have done if we gave this the three-hour treatment.", "Let's go into our narratives. What is the media narrative right now for the bull case and the bear case?", "On the bull, there's just an insane level of customer love for this company. The NPS is around 90.", "David: You're wearing a Peloton hat as we do this.", "Ben: I'm wearing a Peloton hat because I referred you and they sent me $100 of free credit to buy gear for myself, which I proudly wear around.", "I hope Peloton stays a prestige brand because I've definitely bought a decent amount of the merch. Even if they sell, I have to imagine this will stay a prestige brand for a reasonable amount of time.", "It's funny how I feel a little bit weird wearing my SoulCycle shirt and stuff now because I haven’t been in two years, but the Peloton stuff, maybe it says a lot about me, but happy to wear it.", "A huge component of the bull case is, oh my God, we've built this brand that people love. They love the product, they love the experience.", "David, after we record, I will probably go hop on for a ride because we're recording early in the morning and I missed my morning ride this morning.", "Another huge component is say what you want about growth right now, but how could they possibly be worth less than they were worth before COVID?", "They grew membership from 700,000 to nearly 3 million.", "David: And it's not like they're just selling bikes here, this isn't one time. They just added all that subscription revenue with an incredibly low churn rate and high NPS.", "Ben: Yup, totally agree. They invented the connected fitness category and they're still the largest player in it.", "We'll talk about this on power, but there are network effects from your friends having Peloton. The fact that they grew all these subscribers, there is some amount of lock-in that comes from that.", "The biggest thing we talked about is this insanely low churn rate. To date, the fact that they selected for customers that aren't going to churn—and that's slowly shifting because that's the other side of the sword of selling a product that is cheaper than it used to be—is that you're going to have customers that are more sensitive to price all around and so are going to churn more often than your initial cohort.", "David: Even still, the churn has gone up. I think it's gone from like, I'm going to get the numbers wrong, but it was at like 0.6% per month to like 0.8% per month.", "Ben: Totally. I do want to call out, and this is between a bull and a bear case, but it's just an interesting stat to know.", "When a firm went public, there was some information in there as one where at the time, Peloton was the largest customer or the largest source of revenue to Affirm.", "I took Affirm and Peloton up on their offer to finance my bike over the course of a few years rather than pay for it and cash out because it was a 0% deal.", "Someone was basically saying, do you want to keep investing your money and you can pay us once a month over the course of two years and generate some money while you keep the float?", "Ben: All day, I will do that deal. It's funny how much I've thought about this for how little the actual dollars are that is marginal for me to have done this versus pay in cash, but I did.", "David: That's the best Ben Gilbert thing that is possible. I love it.", "Ben: But what's interesting is the fact that they offered it at all. When you look under the covers of, why was Peloton willing to offer 0% or why was Affirm willing to offer 0%?", "What does that deal look like? Peloton and Affirm did a back-end deal where Peloton said, if you agree, Affirm, to do 0% financing, we will pay you an amount in order to make it worth your while and so tell us what that amount is.", "At the time of Affirm's IPO, 28% of all of the revenue in the previous year leading up to the IPO was from the Peloton deal, which if I'm doing the math right based on what their revenue numbers were at the time, that is $150 million a year that Peloton was paying to Affirm to offer this 0% financing thing.", "That gives you a sense of how much Peloton knows and knew. Even then, oh my God we need to expand down the market because we are saturating our wonderfully price-insensitive core customer base or initial customer base.", "David: Wow, that's huge. We're about to release a great LP Show episode with Christina Melas-Kyriazi who just joined Bain Capital Ventures—been a longtime friend of mine but was an early employee at Affirm.", "We talked with her about the whole buy now, pay later space. One of the key value props to merchants is this enables sales that wouldn't happen otherwise, but oh my gosh, you're right, this is between a bull and a bear.", "But trending into the bear category here, the focus on their core customer is really, things have gotten so wonky in the past year-plus.", "Ben: The bear case to make out of that is when you look at their demand recently, the fact that they only grew 9% in Q4 and 5% in Q1, even though they have this Affirm deal out there, even though they're dropping the prices on their bikes, that's the scary thing.", "Their attempts to make this more interesting at more price points to a much broader swath of people is not really working.", "David. Yeah, unless you have more, I think the last bull case, which really is a valuable case is like, hey, I don't like to put faith in single people in general, but I do think there's a lot of fundamental…", "To my mind, my experience as a customer with Peloton makes me believe that there have been just bad product and marketing decisions over the past year.", "That is not a controversial statement at all. They have 100% been bad product and marketing—", "Ben: And bad strategy, bad financial decisions, and bad forecasting.", "David: You got to think that Barry can make a huge difference in fixing a lot of these issues.", "Ben: Yes, for sure. Barry's not going to be the product person by any means, but that's why Foley is there and that's why all the great people that they brought on were there.", "Hopefully, Barry can provide the right—it's almost like the check and balance to make sure that Peloton can do its thing of creating products, brands, and experiences that people love without screwing themselves over financially.", "David: Yup. The market likes the news. Peloton was up 25% yesterday.", "Ben: Yeah. It's kind of a bear case to bring in a career CFO as a CEO. That is a strong admission of how in trouble a company is.", "But I suppose, trading down is that makes it a bull case to want to invest if you feel like that person can turn it around.", "It's definitely not giving Barry enough credit to call him a career CFO, especially given his divisional responsibility in building the ads business at Spotify.", "But you know what, the right comp might be to Apple when they transitioned. This was a much different high-flying company at the time of transition, but transitioning from a products person who was the founder of the company as CEO to an operational financial supply chain, contractual legal person.", "David: Yeah. That's actually a great analogy. I certainly think he's capable. I think the business is capable.", "It probably will never be an Apple, but I think it's capable of performing better than it is now.", "Ben: Okay, more bear narratives. We talked about the slowing growth, we talked about the fact that they revised down not only the revenue targets but also the subscriber targets.", "They're only predicting they're going to be at around $3 million at the end of the year rather than three and a half.", "They have piled up $1.3 billion worth of bikes and treadmills. It's not good to hold it in the books.", "Another interesting narrative that I haven't seen as much around Peloton specifically but seems to be a fairly widely held belief is that in the last 10+ years, there has not been a breakout consumer hardware piece of technology that survives as a standalone company.", "You look back at Fitbit, GoPro, and Jambox. I even want to call out this one's going to be a serious callback, but Flip Video.", "Some of these companies that invented a new category and imbued it with meaning and they pioneered it on hardware that was just now available.", "But that investment doesn't pay itself back. Lots of cheap facsimiles come in and they can't defend the castle.", "You look at Jambox, they made a $300 Bluetooth speaker, and now you can get $20 Bluetooth speakers that are reasonable.", "Flip Video sold to Cisco in a very strange M&A. GoPro is still an independent company, but certainly not the highflier it was when it first IPO'd.", "Fitbit couldn't really survive Apple coming into their market and ultimately landed at Google.", "I think there's probably a case, a similar story around Nest, again, a little bit weird and some bungled M&A.", "I suppose Sonos might be the only example of a recent consumer hardware company that has been \"successful\" as a standalone public business.", "David: I thought about bringing this up earlier in the episode and I decided not to because I decided it was unfair to Peloton.", "I still think it's unfair, but it's an interesting point of comparison. The only very strong counterpoint I can think of is Tesla.", "David: Yeah. Lots of different dynamics there, but if you just look at what Tesla has done, in many ways, a very resonant strategy, a similar harmonizing strategy with Peloton of start with the high, the Elon master plan, right?", "How they've adapted that over the past several years, it was not that long after Peloton was started that the Model S came out.", "What has Tesla done with their brand strategy, their pricing, their marketing, their position within the market, their product development, and their software development?", "Gosh, Model S to Model X—double down on the high-end brand. Then the Model 3, which is affordable, but it's still aspirational.", "You're competing with BMW now. You're not going all the way down to Toyota. The Autopilot launch, Tesla has executed incredibly well and incredibly strategically through, again, different but resonant market dynamics.", "Ben: They've also been able to manipulate the capital markets to raise a ton of capital on extremely favorable terms.", "I'm using manipulated with a lowercase m not accusing them of doing something that has legal implications.", "David: To that point, they had their near-death moments too.", "Ben: Totally, but Peloton has been exactly the opposite at manipulating financial markets for their own favor.", "They had a massive stock run-up and then did a $420 million all-cash deal, and now, more recently they've raised more money after it.", "There's another bear case, which is being floated by our good friends, the activist investors, which is, hey, everyone, did you know John Foley sold $96 million of Peloton stock in 2021 when the price was really high and he was talking about what a strong future the company still had in front of it?", "Their point in doing that is both to accuse him of insidery things, doing things that are against the company policy, but they're also trying to drive home the point that the incentives are now misaligned because he's taken a lot off the table, he's now a very wealthy person in cash.", "That doesn't hold a lot of water to me though because his current remaining stock—even at the closing price on Monday—was $500 million.", "I don't care if you have $96 million. The potential of turning that $500 million into $1, $2, or $3 billion, that's motivating.", "David: Also, he started Peloton in late 2011 or early 2012. It's been a long journey and he talks about it on the How I Built This episode.", "Even though he had done well in his career, he didn't have any big wins. He wasn't fabulously wealthy before he started.", "He wasn't a [...] founder, but he didn't have $96 million, let's put it that way, so I can't begrudge him that.", "Ben: Despite being of the Harvard Business School Network, having worked at IAC, and been close with a lot of CEOs and executives, that really only manifested in him being able to raise a couple of $100,000 despite the fact that he runs in pretty wealthy circles and still couldn't convince any institutions to come in.", "It was like he had good jobs, but he had a family to support. He knew a lot of wealthy people, but that actually didn't really accrue to him successfully capitalizing the business for a long time.", "David: Sometimes activists have good points. There are good points to be made against Peloton here and I think we've been making them.", "But they're also just so whiny, the incentives are so misaligned, and of course, they want to never be happy because they want to keep buying more to then sell.", "Ben: I mean other stuff too, but did I pay $2300 for a bike because it was a Peloton bike that otherwise I would have paid a maximum of $1000 for?", "David: It's interesting. Yes, definite brand power. Yes, that is correct. I did a lot of research and I seriously considered doing a hack a Peloton.", "I enjoy doing stuff like that. To get the same quality of bike, yes, you can do it cheaper with a hack a Peloton, but not that much cheaper.", "It's a very high quality bike relative to the price, but yes, agree on brand.", "Definitely, to me, one that stands out and I think one that attracted Barry is scale economies here. The amount that Peloton can invest—even with the music variable cost overhang—in content and in the best instructors, I think, which is where this plays out the most relative to a SoulCycle, to a Flywheel, to anything else, and then even relative to other connected fitness companies, because Peloton has the largest member base.", "Just like with Netflix, they can invest in more great content because they have more resources for more subscribers and then that's a virtuous flywheel.", "Ben: Totally agree. The proof is in the pudding that Emma Lovewell and others used to be SoulCycle instructors.", "David: Yup. Alex Toussaint started with Flywheel, I believe.", "Ben: I can see that. Yeah, it just makes total sense that Peloton would say, we can make this much more interesting for you both in terms of fame, dollars, and career advancement because your rides are going to be 5000 people instead of 40, and duh, you're going to get the best instructors and content.", "I don't know what the contracts look like, but would that make the instructors and all the content that they've produced a cornered resource?", "At least, my perception is that is the best on demand content that I can get for working out.", "David: Yup. Certainly the library of content. It's interesting, I'm curious what your feeling is on this, from a user perspective.", "It is valuable to me that my favorite instructor is just Alex, he's so awesome—constantly adding new content and stuff like the Ride to Greatness.", "That's extremely valuable to me. If he stopped adding new content, I would seriously consider churning.", "But the years' worth of library, I do go back and do old library content. That's quite valuable to me too.", "Even if he switched to another platform, then yeah, it would take a long time to build up. I've got a few 20-minute rides that he did years ago that are really high quality for me.", "Ben: By the way, there is someone who switched to another platform or at least left. Their names' escaping me, I looked into this a couple of years ago.", "I think Peloton pulled all their content down, which was an interesting move because it's basically saying, we don't want to continue to build your brand for free to compete against us, which I found fascinating because I bet that's totally case by case how they would think about whether they should leave it up or not.", "David: And that's a big stick for the instructors too. If you leave, then all of your library of work goes away.", "Ben: Right. I would Kill Bill all those contracts and understand how that works.", "Ben: Okay, I think those are the big ones. A few interesting little what would have happened otherwise, to go to an old Acquired standby section.", "What if they actually had pursued a deal with SoulCycle? I'm going to use Soul over Flywheel, and I’m going to use I think even though Soul wasn't giving them the time of day, at the moment, that's the more interesting one.", "SoulCycle has not had a very good last couple of years. First, there was the Trump fundraiser and then there was the failed go-public of the SoulCycle, the Equinox fitness conglomerate.", "David: This is not investment advice and also not healthcare advice.", "Ben: The number one place to go and get COVID would be an unventilated box of 50 people breathing as hard as they possibly can for 45 minutes in a room.", "David: But they have candles in there, that helps.", "Ben: I was trying to think, where is the single last place on earth that I want to be during the pandemic and it's at a SoulCycle studio, even though I used to do that a lot before I got my Peloton, and frankly probably never will again.", "I can't imagine going back to that behavior. Even for non-Covid diseases, it's like, if you want to stay healthy…", "David: I would only consider it in—like you and I, when we would get together, we used to do a SoulCycle.", "It was really fun to do it with friends. I would maybe consider that again in the future, but definitely not on a day-to-day basis.", "Ben: Obviously, SoulCycle came out with a Peloton competitor after Peloton did very well. It wasn't fully SoulCycle, it was part SoulCycle, part Equinox parent company.", "I have to imagine, I think it was a total flop. What would have happened if you had this sort of JV between Peloton and SoulCycle five years in in a strong position, six years in, when COVID hit?", "David: It's interesting. I want to say I don't think the JV would have worked nearly as well as Peloton did as a standalone full stack entity.", "Ben: But putting cameras in, building a little SoulCycle studio.", "David: Back to power, there's an element of counter positioning in the early days of Peloton here too.", "There would have been too many incentives and resources within a SoulCycle or a Flywheel to—you would have to really cannibalize a lot of the core in-person operations.", "Take your best instructors and make them dedicated to the online offering. There would have been some weird dynamics there.", "Ben: Every class prints money. So if you're running one of those local studios, you're like, well.", "David: Right. Now you can just record that and put it on this JV with Peloton, but I think that would be lower quality content than a full.", "Ben: The Peloton rides are so produced. In doing this, I was looking at videos about their control room and the number of cameras that they have set up.", "At this point, they're a TV production company with celebrity instructors who happen to be good at riding bikes, but it's a TV studio.", "It would be very hard to turn any of these SoulCycle places into TV studios.", "David: Yup. If you're making the decision at SoulCycle, I'm going to take our best content and instructors, dedicate them to that for this thing that I revenue split with, I don't know.", "Ben: Okay, there's another one here, which I know you want to do is, how should Peloton have managed over the last couple of years?", "What could they have done that would have enabled them to come out really strong?", "David: It's easy to sit here and say the Precor acquisition was dumb. The Peloton Output Park was misguided.", "It's probably good in the long run to bring your production in-house, but that big using cash at that moment in time, probably not the right thing.", "I've talked to everyone's ear off about my feelings on the product and pricing decisions. At the same time, I think we got to be intellectually honest here with ourselves and with the market too, it was easy to believe.", "It would have been hard to really think about the downside over the past year as everything was up to the right.", "It's a rare, rare, rare leader in company that I think can stay disciplined through what was probably one of the biggest boons for any company of all time.", "Ben: Yup. On the other hand, other companies, I think the difference is, a lot of these other companies’ demand didn't go away.", "Amazon saw a spike, but then it kept rising from across all their businesses, whereas Peloton saw a spike and then a decline.", "It's funny. I was thinking about what would be an interesting comparison here. I think Eric Yuan against John Foley is an interesting one or let's just say Zoom against Peloton.", "Both of these were pandemic era go-go stocks that have totally crashed. Peloton down over 80% from peak Zoom down over 70%.", "But for Zoom, despite the fall, I think it's still growing revenues at close to 100% year-over-year and is a free cash flow positive machine.", "Whereas Peloton is deeply unprofitable on a full bottom line, still raising billions from the public market with new stock issuances.", "They seem convinced that this demand spike would last forever with these acquisitions and expensive investments.", "It's funny, I don't want to blame the management as much as I want to blame—maybe it is management, but it's kind of an inability to forecast and know that demand is drying up.", "Being in a business that just requires a lot more moving pieces, a lot more atoms, that's just really hard.", "David: This demand spike created huge complexities for Peloton as a business in a way that for Zoom, it created some complexities for Zoom.", "I don't want to say it was just easy, but they’re shipping software. It's different here.", "Ben: Yup. All right, let's grade this one. I think what we should do is paint the A scenario and maybe a C or an F scenario for what Barry does from here and what those outcomes are.", "David: Yeah. Maybe let's start with the C scenario because I think that's the more interesting one. F is obvious like, this business falls off a cliff and there's no more demand ever.", "David: Yeah, right. I don't think that's likely, but that's...", "Ben: I think a C is it's selling in the next six months.", "David: Yup, or even $20 billion. Selling within the next year for a nice short-term shareholder return, I think that's a C.", "Ben: I think a lot of shareholders would be very happy selling this thing in a year for $20 billion.", "David: I totally agree. I think shareholders would be happy. I think it would be sad if that happened.", "We don't know Barry at all. We've never talked to him. Barry, open invitation. When this chapter is over, you got to come on the podcast and we got to do a recap.", "Ben: Or if you want to do a follow-up now, what do we get right, what do we get wrong? We're happy to host.", "David: Yeah, totally. We are such huge fans of yours. But I don't think he would have taken this just to package it up for a sale in 6 to 12 months.", "Ben: Yeah, I agree. I will say I don't think this is an independent, enduring company at this point. I think it's going to be more along the lines of a lot of the consumer electronics companies that we've talked about where I think Barry can turn it around.", "I think you can have tight financial controls where it's run like a good company and make smarter investments.", "I have a hard time knowing how they're going to grow 50% year-over-year at any time in the future. Where are they going to go find more demand, or where are they going to really meaningfully alter their product lines to go find more demand?", "That's the A+. That's the A if they can figure out how to stay an independent company and become a big, profitable, independent company and meaningfully find demand in concentric circles outside their current customer base.", "David: Right. Yes, that's the A+. That's the dream, for sure. Let's think about that. They have what, a little under 3 million subscribers currently?", "David: I don't know the numbers. Let's assume 2/3 of that is US and 1/3 elsewhere. That may be generous, but let's just use that as a swag.", "That's 2 million US subscribers out of a nation of 330 million people. There are probably a lot more than two million people that could be in an addressable segment for Peloton.", "Then there is the digital app. The digital app is a good experience. I started that way. I graduated up, but it's a really good experience.", "Apple is investing in a similar strategy to the digital fitness app. I think for $12.99 a month for a super high quality class, this is the Netflix model.", "For the best content out there with the best instructors for $12.99 a month, that's accessible to a lot of people.", "I think there's probably still headroom on the core affluent aspirational segments or maybe you call those two segments.", "I think they can address both affluent people who don't care about cost and aspirational people who do care about cost but are willing to invest in this, and then you layer on the digital product.", "There is a world where this could become, maybe not forever, but a longer term standalone company that actually is justifiable of a $49 billion market cap.", "Ben: I like it. I don't think that's the most likely outcome. I think two years from now, the most likely thing is that it's acquired by someone.", "But the fun thing is, we will get to watch and see, and we both just said all that on air.", "David: We'll revisit with Barry in a couple of years.", "Ben: You and I are, yes, over video chat here. Carve out?", "David: Carve outs. Related carve out. As I said at the top of the episode, whether you enjoyed this emergency pod or not, whatever you think of it, go watch that interview with Barry McCarthy at the Hill School.", "It is so good. Really the only artifact, a long form interview with him dedicated to just him. There's some stuff where he talks about direct listing on the a16z podcast and others, but that's just about him and his career.", "It's worth watching and there's a great nugget in there.", "He talks about his strategy exercise that he likes to do that they did in Netflix and Spotify, and I'm sure he will bring to Peloton, of how to plan and build your organization to be resilient and robust for the future.", "His four- to five-year strategy exercise. I won't spoil too much of it, but it's very good and worth watching and listening to that.", "Ben: Sweet. Mine is also related. Since the Taylor Swift episode, I've been listening to a lot of Switched On Pop.", "There is an awesome episode called the James Bond Spycraft Sound. The hosts of Switched On Pop are just awesome.", "The show is reliably great. It's like Acquired for music is a way to think about it.", "I've been really hooked on music podcasts, but this one, in particular, gives the whole history of the Bond theme of all the songs that are used for all the different movies across all the decades.", "They're musically related. It's really cool to listen to how they pull out these different elements of that very mysterious chord at the end of the Bond theme and how that gets used through the decades in all the different movie themes.", "I highly recommend that song. It's super fun. It's my carve out.", "David: I went and listened to that episode after we were texting about it and it's so good. The whole show is so good.", "Yeah, it's so good. One of my favorite parts about it was it reminded me that Chris Cornell's song for Casino Royale is so good.", "David: Rest in peace, Chris Cornell, but that is one of the best bond themes of all time.", "Ben: Yes. Listeners, thank you for going on the journey with us. Go check out the LP Show. Our latest episode with the NZS Capital folks is really good.", "They're just so smart. If you're staring at stock tickers getting anxious, this is not investment advice, but it will help you bring a cool steady hand.", "Ben: Otherwise, trying times. Yes. If you want to join us for the Zoom call tonight if you're listening to this on drop day, then join acquired.fm/lp and we will see you in the Zoom later tonight.", "We have a job board, acquired.fm/jobs. Find your next great career move. Yeah, tell your friends about this.", "You can find us in video on Spotify right alongside Taylor Swift and many other great artists and podcasts or anywhere where you get your podcasts.", "Thank you to Vanta, Vouch, and the SoftBank Latin America Fund. Listeners, we'll see you next time.", "Note: Acquired hosts and guests may hold assets discussed in this episode.

On the negative side, marketing as a percentage of revenue was 16%, which is the second highest mark ever, trailing only Q4 2018’s 17%.", "Worse, that spend resulted in fewer net new subscribers (8.76 million) than Q4 2018 (8.84 million).", "I did a much deeper dive into Netflix’s marketing spend in 2018, where I argued that the company’s reported marketing costs provided an incomplete view into Netflix’s customer acquisition costs:", "That means, though, that an accurate measure of Netflix’s customer acquisition costs should include the cost of content, at least in part.", "For a rough approximation you could use the company’s negative free cash flow as a proxy for which content costs should be attributed to customer acquisition (because the company is using debt to invest in content under the presumption that it will attract future subscribers that will pay for it); presuming 20% churn, it turns out Netflix’s real customer acquisition costs are much higher than what they seem.", "Here is the chart that followed, updated through this last quarter:", "Marketing definitely continues to trend higher — note that Q2 was even worse from a CAC perspective — but still, the company’s spend-ahead on content, presuming you agree with my reasoning as to why it should count in customer acquisition costs, remains the biggest driver, and it skyrocketed again.", "Speaking of that negative cash flow, the final total was -$3.27 billion for the year, up from -$3.02 billion in 2018.", "The difference is worth noting because of what Netflix said after earnings a year ago:", "Free cash flow in Q4’18 was -$1.3 billion vs. -$0.5 billion in Q4’17, totalling -$3 billion for 2018 (compared to our original forecasted range of -$3 to -$4 billion for the full year).", "We expect 2019 FCF will be similar to 2018 and then will improve each year thereafter (assuming, as we do, no material transactions).", "This FCF improvement will be driven by growing operating margin, which will allow us to fund more of our investment needs internally.", "The fact that Netflix ended up having 7% more negative cash flow in 2019 does suggest that growth overall was a bit more sluggish than the company expected, likely because of more elasticity of demand than expected.", "That noted, Netflix reiterated in their investor letter this quarter that this quarter would be peak negative cash flow, and the company’s improving gross margins (37% versus 35% a year ago) suggest that the company is still gaining scale on its costs.", "Of course given the way Netflix amortizes content costs, profits are very much a trailing indicator, albeit one with a story to tell.", "Here is Netflix’s gross profit margin over the last five years:", "There was a meaningful shift two years ago; interestingly, that shift aligned with a big increase in Netflix’s negative cash flows:", "At first glance, these graphs seem to be contradicting each other: Netflix was spending more money even as its margins were increasing?", "The answer to this riddle was provided by Spencer Neumann, Netflix’s Chief Financial Officer, on Tuesday’s earnings interview.", "The question was what was most misunderstood about the company:", "I think what was most misunderstood is the business model and what you see in our cash flow generally, and folks thinking that we are losing money.", "What we’ve shown is that we are increasing our profitability both through growth and growing our profit margins.", "And what you’ve seen over the last few years is forward investment as we’ve been going through a really kind of pretty significant transition of our business model from licensed content, where you pay basically ratably for content you receive over the time, and it’s on the network, to original content, not just licensed originals, but self-produced originals where oftentimes we’re investing many years before that content is on the service.", "And we’ve moved, as they say, well, along the curve there were the bulk of our cash spend is now on original content.", "So as we’ve gotten bigger, as we’ve moved towards originals, it just fundamentally changes that cash flow profile over time.", "And we’re a very profitable business and one that will ultimately over the years become meaningfully self-funding.", "I wrote about the significance of Netflix shifting to self-production back in 2016, but primarily in terms of how that was the natural endpoint for a service built on Internet assumptions:", "Netflix’s shift here is important: owning content means it will only ever be available on Netflix forever (unless Netflix itself licenses it, as they plan to do in China).", "This was never a viable business model before the Internet: content creation is a massive fixed cost that is best paid for by getting it in front of the maximum number of customers; this meant maximizing reach both geographically (worldwide licensing agreements) as well as temporally (exclusive licenses for first-run, then syndication for re-runs).", "This meant that the optimal approach was for one set of companies to invest in content creation and then make deals with a completely different set of companies which managed distribution in different geographic regions and on different time scales.", "Netflix is completely different: the service is fully global, which takes care of geographic reach, and is fully on-demand, which means shows are available from the moment they are released until the end of time (or Netflix).", "I know this sounds obvious but this is really a dramatic change: the Internet has effectively allowed Netflix to replace every single video distributor on earth with a single entity, which by extension makes it possible to integrate backwards into the actual creation of content.", "Of course this is very expensive, but that is where Aggregation Theory comes in: by winning on the user experience Netflix has accumulated significant enough subscription revenue that the company can afford to modularize content creators to the show level (augmented by debt, which effectively pulls forward revenue from anticipated future growth).", "Earlier in that Daily Update I did note that “owning a show (as opposed to licensing it) is much more expensive up-front”, but I failed to fully internalize the implications: the more that Netflix’s content spend shifted to self-production from licensing, the more front-loaded its content costs would be.", "It follows, then, that cash outflows would increase substantially but profit margins would increase as those cash outflows were amortized (since Netflix was cutting out the middle-person).", "I first coined the term “ladder-up” strategy in the context of Netflix when they went global in 2016:", "Netflix remains the textbook example of what I would call a “ladder-up” strategy:", "- Netflix started by using content that was freely available (DVDs) to offer a benefit — no due dates and a massive selection — that was orthogonal to the established incumbent (Blockbuster).", "This built up Netflix’s user base, brand recognition, and pocketbook", "- Netflix then leveraged their user base and pocketbook to acquire streaming rights in the service of a model that was, again, orthogonal to incumbents (linear television networks).", "This expanded Netflix’s user base, transformed their brand, and continued to increase their buying power", "- With an increasingly high-profile brand, large user base, and ever deeper pockets, Netflix moved into original programming that was orthogonal to traditional programming buyers: creators had full control and a guarantee that they could create entire seasons at a time, and, in the beginning, the rights to use what they created elsewhere (more on this is a moment)", "Each of these intermediary steps was a necessary prerequisite to everything that followed, culminating in yesterday’s announcement: Netflix can credibly offer a service worth paying for in any country on Earth, thanks to all of the IP it itself owns.", "This is how a company accomplishes what, at the beginning, may seem impossible: a series of steps from here to there that build on each other.", "Moreover, it is not only an impressive accomplishment, it is also a powerful moat; whoever wishes to compete has to follow the same time-consuming process.", "Netflix’s shift to fully self-produced content points to another rung on the ladder: the fact that the Netflix brand matters more than any one particular show.", "This was Chief Content Officer Ted Sarandos’ answer to the “misunderstood” question:", "In terms of misunderstood, I think there is this notion you hear every once in a while to where there is so much stuff on Netflix everything gets lost.", "And I think that the opposite is true, which you’ll see in those numbers that we release you in the letter.", "Our ability to launch new brands, to sustain brands over multiple seasons or multiple sequels, and at a very high volume from all over the world has been unparalleled.", "And the idea that we can create brands out of thin air over and over again sometimes multiple times in a week like this past week is something that I’m super proud of.", "And I think it gets lost on people because they think all this content is for them. It isn’t. It’s just meant to be your favorite show and your favorites movie and that’s going to be something for everybody.", "See also CEO Reed Hastings answer about Netflix losing Friends:", "It was about years 10 ago we had to drop all the Disney content, not phased out like we are now, but all at once, that we had in the Starz deal.", "And we were all worried about the big impact and instead people came back. The magic of the personalized service was they were able to find other things to watch and viewing growth just kept rising.", "We’ve seen that phenomenon over and over again, even one that may be been even more dramatic than that was when all the Nickelodeon content came off and was completely displaced by other kids watching overnight.", "I should say equally good content — just people had the ability to find something new.", "People do not come to Netflix because of a show; they watch a show because it is on Netflix. That is why Netflix’s viewing numbers continued to increase in a quarter where Disney+ and Apple TV+ dominated the headlines, and it’s why Netflix is ok puttering along with its strategy of releasing entire seasons at once, instead of an episode a week.", "It’s so unique. Sometimes the show can enter the zeitgeist in such a loud way like Stranger Things Season 3 around the 4th of July phenomenon, everything that happened that a lot of that viewing pops.", "Something similar we saw with a huge launch for Witcher: Witcher was kind of pent-up demand for known IP, but the show delivered for people, who delivered viewing hours for us.", "And people loved it right out of the gate. Other shows come out and they pop and they’re dependable and they build and people are going to watch it as soon as they finish what they’re watching right now.", "So it’s very different from show to show. I see you can see that in that list of how those shows will perform.", "And sometimes that it’s a really great indicator of its full-year performance. And sometimes its new shows will continue to build on their positive word-of-mouth and become even bigger over time.", "Netflix is willing to forego the culture drumbeat enjoyed by, say, The Mandalorian, because (1) the goal is not first-run ratings and (2) it operates under the assumption that everyone already has Netflix, which means the viewers that care will get to it eventually.", "It also explains one other interesting tidbit from the call: Netflix executives claimed that they don’t have a set schedule for price raises, but rather wait and see how many hits they have.", "Chief Product Officer Greg Peters: We don’t have a fixed model for our price raises…I think our job is to actually listen to our members.", "If the signals that they’re giving us in terms of the engagement that we’re seeing that we gain from growth that you heard we’re going after.", "And we’ll really use that as a mechanism to guide us towards whether we earned that opportunity to come back and ask for more.", "So we’re not really coming in with just a fixed model that we’re going to shift to or anything like that.", "Chief Financial Officer Spencer Neumann: And if we’re putting hits on the board. We can see that in the terms of watching an engagement and subscriber growth and growth and the zeitgeist.", "The more you can do that the more frequently you can go back. So we have this great model of where we have to prove ourselves to our members literally every month.", "So it really does hold us to a very high bar and keeps us coming back and doing more and topping ourselves if we need to.", "Here’s the thing with hits: per the previous point, existing customers are not going to watch them right away.", "They will add them to their queue — in the app or in their head — and that queue will be a reason to overlook a price increase.", "After all, you have a show you wanted to watch. And, by the time you watched it, you forgot about the price increase anyways.", "Oh, and by the way, Netflix already paid for the hit: that negative cash flow is not just customer acquisition costs, it is retention as well, and the margins are looking good.", "The Daily Update is intended for a single recipient, but occasional forwarding is totally fine!

How would it affect the future of game ownership?", "Now, coming up on the service’s fourth anniversary, public perception has cleared, and the verdict is near-universal: Xbox Game Pass has been heralded as a cost-effective, accessible alternative to traditional game purchasing for many players.", "As Sony takes a bigger step into offering its own subscriptions with its “all-new PlayStation Plus” and Nintendo has tried its own hand at a similar service with some of the benefits of Nintendo Switch Online, we’re taking a look back at how Xbox Game Pass has evolved since its inception, from an unproven concept to the backbone of Microsoft’s gaming ambitions.", "Microsoft originally envisioned Xbox Game Pass as a rental service. The project was known internally as Arches, though the concept would never make it to market in that form.", "Microsoft, seeing the success of other media streaming services like Netflix and Spotify, pivoted toward a subscription model, and thus Game Pass as we know it was born.", "The pitch for Game Pass, passionately spearheaded by Xbox boss Phil Spencer, was met with resistance, as publishers expressed concern about devaluing their own products for Microsoft’s potential gain.", "Spencer saw things differently. His vision was both clear and, as time has proven, feasible: Game Pass was an opportunity for mutual growth, for Microsoft to expand its active user base on Xbox and for publishers to grow player counts, extend games’ shelf lives, and ultimately increase revenue through continued sales and in-game transactions — not to mention the guaranteed money from Microsoft for allowing their games on the service.", "Spencer and co. ultimately sold publishers on the idea by pitching a low-risk investment: Give us your older games, games whose revenue streams have effectively dried up, and let’s see what happens.", "With publisher support secured, Microsoft officially unveiled Xbox Game Pass in February 2017. The $10 USD/month service featured access to a library of over 100 Xbox One and Xbox 360 games, as well as subscriber-exclusive discounts.", "The service officially launched four months later on June 1, featuring Halo 5: Guardians, Gears of War, Borderlands, BioShock, and more.", "As Microsoft predicted, and as publishers soon found out, player engagement surpassed expectations: total player counts, as well as subscribers’ average spending and genre experimentation, increased significantly, according to Xbox.", "Weeks later Microsoft announced original Xbox backward compatibility was coming to Xbox One, providing the company an opportunity to offer fully downloadable games across three console generations through Game Pass.", "This was not only a boon for the Game Pass catalog but for past-generation accessibility and game preservation as well — a notable point in Microsoft’s favor compared to the way Sony and Nintendo have handled its legacy titles.", "Both have seen pushback from fans after announcements like Nintendo's plans to close its 3DS and Wii U eShops without plans to support those libraries on future consoles, along with a similar decision by PlayStation for the PS3, Vita, and PSP stores, though that decision was later reversed for the PS3 and Vita shops.", "No addition to Game Pass has been more impactful than Microsoft's commitment to launching all of its first-party games day and date on the service in 2018.", "Subscribers have since gained access to over a dozen Xbox Game Studios games — the latest Halo, Gears, Forza, State of Decay, Psychonauts, and more — at no additional cost.", "The decision now highlights the starkest contrast between Game Pass and Sony’s recently revealed service.", "Sony won’t include first-party games at launch as part of its overhauled PlayStation Plus; Sony’s Jim Ryan said the company is “in a good virtuous cycle with [its] studios, where the investment delivers success, which enables yet more investment, which delivers yet more success,” and including exclusives at launch would break “that virtuous cycle,\" according to Ryan, which largely seems to imply PlayStation believes not having its exclusives selling upwards of 20 million copies would simply be leaving too much money on the table.", "Microsoft launched its first game into Game Pass in March 2018 with Sea of Thieves. It’s proven to be a fitting start to the initiative, as Rare's pirate adventure is a shining example of what the service can do for a game: Following a lukewarm reception at launch, Sea of Thieves has received four years of consistent updates and, as of October 2021, reached 25 million players.", "In a pre-Game Pass world, Microsoft may have dismissed Sea of Thieves as a flop after that tepid launch.", "Instead, it’s one of Microsoft’s most celebrated new franchises in recent memory, and a much-needed success for a storied developer who had struggled to find its footing since joining Xbox in 2002.", "More recently, Xbox released Halo Infinite and Forza Horizon 5 into Game Pass. They garnered 20 million and 18 million players, respectively, by the end of 2021, resulting in each series’ biggest-ever launch (and the biggest release in Xbox Game Studios history).", "It’s unclear how much Game Pass cut into these games’ actual sales, or how much money they've made through downloadable content avenues, though it is clear that Microsoft isn't overly concerned: Since 2015, the company has turned to active users as its key metric for success, and in that regard, both Halo Infinite and Forza Horizon 5 shattered series records.", "(It is worth noting that Forza Horizon 5 debuted as the fourth-best selling game last November in North America, according to NPD.)", "Complementing its Day One Game Pass initiative is Microsoft’s acquisition strategy, bringing acclaimed developers under the Xbox umbrella to create new games that bolster the Game Pass library.", "Microsoft’s recent acquisition spree truly kicked off in 2018, when it purchased four studios: Playground Games, Undead Labs, Ninja Theory, and Compulsion Games.", "Microsoft has since acquired RPG experts Obsidian and inXile, Double Fine, the whole of Bethesda, and most recently Activision-Blizzard.", "The two latest acquisitions — Bethesda and Activision — are notable in that they are full publishers rather than single development studios.", "This not only provides Microsoft with more future Game Pass titles, but it also provides an immediate boost to Game Pass by integrating these publishers’ sizable backlogs.", "Thanks in part to these acquisitions, Xbox's exclusive drought seems to be over.

The cloud infrastructure Microsoft has built will enable the company to further its goal of making games as accessible as possible.", "Spencer has been quoted multiple times referencing Microsoft’s desire to reach billions of gamers, and removing the need for iterative pieces of $300-500 hardware is a significant step toward realizing that ambition.", "Improving accessibility also involves expanding the availability of Game Pass both geographically and technologically: Game Pass recently came to Steam Deck, and Microsoft’s Liz Hamren (via Thurrott) confirmed the company is also working to integrate Game Pass directly into smart TVs and “developing standalone streaming devices that you can plug into a TV or monitor.”", "This play at accessibility has been at the heart of Xbox’s brand revival. While consumers are benefitting, this isn’t pure altruism; it’s business.", "However, there are times when business and consumer interests align, times when what best serves a company also serves consumers.", "Game Pass, for now, represents one such synergetic scenario.", "The future of Game Pass is the future of Xbox.

Spencer has implied the $15/month price tag for Ultimate is likely going to stay in place for the foreseeable future, while more explicitly telling Axios Game Pass is “very, very sustainable right now.\"", "A higher-priced Game Pass family plan, however, is reportedly in the works, potentially allowing up to five players to share a single subscriptiion across multiple consoles and households within the same country.", "As for the sustainability of releasing future games on Game Pass, publishers' initial worries, at least in some cases, have been remedied by the aforementioned increases in player engagement and spending.", "Some games — Descenders, for example — even saw a dramatic increase in sales after being added to Game Pass, as reported by GamesIndustry.biz.", "While games are a consumer product that must be marketed and sold, they must first be created, and these creations are the culmination of countless artistic, technological, and managerial disciplines coming together.", "It's one thing for Game Pass to improve a publisher's financial position, but how has it affected developers' creative processes?", "For some of Xbox's internal studios, at least, it's reportedly been liberating.", "Double Fine boss Tim Schafer told GI.biz Game Pass has allowed him to revisit “some of the crazy game ideas” he previously shelved due to lack of financial viability; Obsidian’s Feargus Urquhart said, “Game Pass emboldens us to go, 'We think this could be super cool', and there's people who can just try it”; and Bethesda’s Todd Howard echoed that sentiment, saying, “Game Pass opens up the creative canvas to many more types of games that may not find an audience in other ways.”", "With commercial and creative viability now a known quantity, Xbox Game Pass is only going to grow. In addition to Microsoft's entire upcoming first-party slate, third-party games S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2, A Plague Tale: Requiem, and Atomic Heart are all joining Game Pass at launch.", "The service may also see a massive wave of new games in the first half of 2023 if/when Microsoft finalizes its acquisition of Activision-Blizzard and obtains the entire Call of Duty catalog, among many other games.", "Over the course of four years, Xbox Game Pass has shifted from a perceived risky bet to a cornerstone of the entire Xbox experience.", "The service is the result of a near-decade-long course correction that began when Phil Spencer took over as head of Xbox following the disastrous rollout of Xbox One.", "Not long ago there were questions of Xbox’s demise; now the company is at the forefront of gaming's next frontier.", "Game Pass, coupled with excellent hardware innovations in the forms of Xbox One X and Series X|S, has brought confidence back to the brand and restored a communal excitement last felt during the days of Xbox 360.", "Jordan is a freelance writer for IGN who's discovered countless games (and saved hundreds of dollars) thanks to Xbox Game Pass.", "His favorite Game Pass discovery is Slay the Spire."]}

This is against a backdrop of a fragmenting media landscape which has resulted in competition for eyeballs across traditional TV, online subscription services, social media and gaming, among other options.", "This is where sports documentaries fit in and can help to change the demographics of current fanbases by pairing behind-the-scenes footage with exclusive access to key sports personalities and athletes.", "Shows such as All or Nothing and Drive to Survive are housed on subscription video-on-demand (SVOD) platforms which naturally skew younger, and as a result those who regularly watch these series are 11 per cent more likely to be aged under 35 than average sport fans.", "For these younger audiences, for whom authenticity and storytelling are key to engagement, immersive sports documentaries allow them to get closer to the athletes and the sport, and see the human side of it.", "To assess the true impact of this narrative-driven editorial on an event, let’s look at what is arguably the most successful of these: Netflix’s Drive to Survive.", "The series launched in March 2019 with a behind-the-scenes look at the teams and drivers involved in Formula One’s 2018 season and has been recommissioned every year since.", "Crucially, the show has had a clear impact on Netflix’s penetration among the sport’s existing fanbase – in the third quarter of 2021, 64 per cent of Formula One fans in Ampere’s consumer tracker said they had household access to Netflix, compared to 53 per cent in the first quarter of 2019.", "This is a growth of 21 per cent compared to 14 per cent among all respondents in the study, and translates into approximately US$40.5 million in incremental revenue for Netflix from the additional subscribers.", "But what has the impact been on Formula One’s fanbase?", "Ampere’s consumer data shows that from Q1 2019 to Q3 2021, there has also been an upward trend in sports fans who enjoy watching Formula One, with the fastest growing demographic being 18 to 24 year olds, whose engagement has increased by ten per cent during that time.", "Regionally, this has grown most in North America, which has seen a 34 per cent rise in interest among this demographic, which is greater than growth seen by stock car racing series Nascar, the Summer Olympics and English soccer’s Premier League during the same period.", "North America, and the US in particular, have been cited publicly as key for Formula One due to the huge sports rights deals available and the large number of potential fans to convert.", "This importance was cemented in 2021 with the announcement of a ten-year deal for the Miami Grand Prix, bringing the number of races in the region up to three.", "Therefore for Formula One and its owner Liberty Global, ambitions of growth in the territory are not simply limited to ancillary content, but also live access to the sport.", "Among 18 to 24 year olds, APAC is the only region which hasn’t seen growth, with the largest declines in popularity evident in Australia and Japan.", "Yet while Formula One hasn’t been as successful in attracting younger audiences in that particular market, interest in viewing increased by six per cent in the region as a whole between Q1 2019 and Q3 2021.", "Much of this is being driven by older consumers, which aligns with the audiences most engaged with sports documentaries in the region – those aged between 25 and 54 years old.", "Two years is not a long time in sport, especially when a rights owner is looking to shift the demographic profile of its event, but early indications suggest that initiatives such as Drive to Survive are beginning to have an impact in driving new interest from younger fans.", "The proportion of Formula One fans aged 18 to 34 within Ampere’s study has increased from 26 per cent in Q1 2019 to nearly 30 per cent as of Q3 2021.", "Although a small increase, it shows that the sport is heading in the right direction.", "For the PGA Tour and tennis’ professional circuits, in the context of their deals with Netflix for new documentaries, these are exactly the demographic shifts they will hope to see in their fanbases.", "Golf and tennis have long had difficulties in attracting younger groups – currently over 50 per cent of the PGA Tour’s fanbase and 48 per cent of the ATP’s fanbase is over 45 years old – so they will be hoping that by opening the doors to their sports, they can engage fans in a way that hasn’t been done before.", "Tennis, arguably, has an initial advantage over golf through personalities such as Naomi Osaka and Emma Raducanu who are young, social media savvy and can engage younger audiences.", "But documentary series on SVOD platforms can make a difference, too.", "For Formula One, the 2021 title race was one of the most exciting and controversial in years.

Afterwards, Chen accepted his role as Dr. Yueh.", "The decision to cast Benjamin Clementine as the Herald of the Change occurred after Maisler enjoyed his performance in the Tiny Desk Concerts.[62]", "Sharon Duncan-Brewster auditioned for her role in London through Jina Jay, a casting director working with Maisler at the time, saying that she \"exudes an intelligence and a power and an inner strength\".", "When Maisler presented a shortlist for potential cast members, Villeneuve selected Duncan-Brewster.[62]", "Her casting was confirmed in April 2020.[38] The idea to change Kynes' gender was suggested by Jon Spaihts, which Villeneuve promptly accepted.[52] According to Duncan-Brewster, Villeneuve opted for the change as he felt it was not necessary to adhere to all of the elements in the book in order to remain faithful to the character's nature.[39]", "[edit]The set design was done by production designer Patrice Vermette.[77] Vermette based the set design for Dune by the need \"to ground the story into realistic settings to help the audience believe in the extraordinary elements\".", "He sought to make the sets as realistic and immersive as possible, using minimal set extensions and no greenscreens.[21][78]", "Prior to the creation of any sets or visual effects, Villeneuve and a group of specific people, worked together to define the visual language for the film.[21]", "Vermette created a \"visual bible\" to guide the development of set design and keep it consistent with the film's visual effects design, intending to help \"extrapolate the world\".", "He also re-read the novel, as he felt that \"the book gives a lot of clues or cues that will help you navigate it to design things, but it's quite nonspecific\", adding that he wanted to support Villeneuve's original vision of the novel when he read it as a young teenager, and base the design around Herbert's original novel.[78][79][80]", "The team's early mood boards for the visual language of the film consisted of Mesopotamian ziggurat architecture, Egyptian references, World War II bunkers, Brazilian and Soviet brutalist architecture, minimalist megastructures and dams designed by Superstudio, and imagery of glaciers taking over mountains.[21]", "The design for the ornithopters was conceived by Villeneuve and storyboard artist Sam Hudecki. Villeneuve wanted the ornithopter to be \"muscular\"; he wanted it to resemble a dragonfly and helicopter, but also appear realistic and adhere to basic laws of science.", "This fit in with his overall perception of the Dune world being retro-futuristic and analog.

Vermette spoke of the challenges involved in creating the set designs used for the sandworms, stating \"It was a creature that commanded respect, and it's almost seen as a deity in the world of the Fremen.", "So that's why the first time you see the depiction of the sand worm on the mural, it's presented with sun coming out of its mouth\".[84]", "The design for Arrakeen was influenced by the book's description of Arrakis's climate, with Vermette calling it \"the biggest residency ever built by humankind\" and \"a response as a colonial entity that took over the planet for the exploitation of ... spice\".", "He designed the city in a \"rock bowl\" shape to protect its infrastructure from sandworms, and built buildings at an angle to protect them from high wind speeds.", "The walls were thickened to make the interiors cooler.

the Arab and Oriental elements for the story, and focusing more on Fremen culture and society rather than the elements of geopolitical worldbuilding from the book, noting how Princess Irulan's original historical epigraphs in the book being replaced with Chani's narration.", "However, Dridi stated that the film framed Fremen society through Paul's perspective, which constrained the Oriental

The next day, shares in the SVOD pioneer dropped 25% to $397.50 each and pundits were claiming that the tide was shifting away from the company that basically invented the subscription streaming video business.", "A few days later, on January 27, Netflix shares rose 10% after it was revealed that hedge fund guru William Ackman’s Pershing Square Capital Management said his fund purchased $1 billion in Netflix stock on January 21, boosting confidence in the company once again.", "Later, on January 31, Netflix founder and co-CEO Reed Hastings said in an Securities and Exchange Commission filing that he bought about $20 million in Netflix stock, which drove the shares up another 11.1% to $427.14 each.", "The thought was that Netflix stock had weathered the storm, that investors saw the intrinsic value in the company and its business and the stock would return to normal.", "Netflix shares closed at $457.13 on February 1, up 7% each.", "But it didn’t last long. Netflix shares began to slide and by February 2 fell 6% to $429.48 each.

But Netflix was singled out because it spends the most on content and had been considered to be the unstoppable force of streaming TV.", "Shares were down again Monday to $402.10 after Needham & Co. media analyst Laura Martin issued a report claiming that only half of Netflix subscribers were satisfied with the service despite having its strongest content year ever, and 41% say they are more likely to jettison the service this year.", "Martin surveyed 504 Netflix subscribers in the U.S. (the service has more than 75 million domestic customers) and concluded if the SVOD pioneer wants to stop the bleeding, it has to add an advertising tier, buy an old media library to improve its content ROICs and/or sell out.", "The smarter way to stay on top of the streaming and OTT industry.

Secondly, everybody is experiencing some kind of subscriber slowdown.", "Thirdly, all indications are that people are watching more video than they ever have, but if they aren’t watching streamers and are increasingly cutting the pay TV cord, what are they watching, video games?", "Or maybe the other explanation is that they are moving toward free ad-supported services like Pluto TV, Tubi and the like.", "Tubi already predicted that AVOD subscribers will surpass SVOD subscribers later this year. Maybe pricing really is becoming more and more important.", "But whatever it is, providers should take notice, because investors are. Disney Plus parent The Walt Disney Co.’s stock was down about 5% between January 20 and February 9 and HBO Max parent AT&T fell 12% in the same timeframe, partly because of the fears around streaming.", "While Disney seemed to reverse the slowdown in fiscal Q1 -- adding about 11.8 million Disney Plus subscribers, well ahead of consensus and driving its stock up 5.5% early February 10 -- some analysts pointed to possible weakness ahead.", "Fiscal Q1 was helped by new content releases, including the three-part Beatles documentary Get Back, and new programming could help accelerate subscriber growth beyond Q1 levels.", "But Barclays media analyst Kannan Venkateshwar worried that it may not be enough to get the service back on track to its previous guidance levels.", "Disney reiterated its guidance of 230 million to 250 million Disney Plus subscribers by 2024.", "“Next quarter may be a trough both seasonally as well as in terms of footprint expansion and content releases,” Venkateshwar wrote.", "“Q3 will see launches in 40 new territories in addition to tailwind from the IPL [Indian Premier League cricket] in India, which should add to growth, but Q4 will likely bear the bulk of the growth load due to release calendar.", "Given this cadence, the company may not be able to fully get back to its guidance trendline this year despite strong fiscal Q1.”", "Attracting the most attention from Martin’s survey is that 41% of respondents said they were “more likely to churn” from Netflix in 2022 because of the price increases.", "Take that with however big a grain of salt you want -- there’s a huge difference between “I probably will cancel” and “I just cancelled.”", "But it does cast some shadow on what in the past has been the gold standard for streaming. Martin’s survey also suggests that 70% of respondents say they won’t pay for additional streaming services in 2022, which doesn’t bode well for the remainder of the streamer-verse.", "In her report, Martin wrote the “clear learnings” from the survey were: (1) That consumers believe they’ve watched “everything” Netflix had to offer during the pandemic of 2020 and 2021, and there was “nothing” on rival services like Discovery Plus and Peacock.", "“Better to pay for new services than old,” she wrote; and (2) Netflix still doesn’t offer a lower priced ad-supported tier like most of its competitors, meaning that “consumers that disconnect Netflix can replace it with 2 or 3 different streaming services for an identical monthly fee.”", "Martin has been a sharp critic of Netflix in the past, and has called for a lower cost, ad-supported tier ever since Disney Plus came on the scene in 2019 at a $6.99 monthly price point.", "Netflix management has been adamant in its resistance to including ads in programming in the past. And maybe all it will take is another popular movie or show or series or whatever to bring people back to the fold.", "But the fold is a lot different than it was in the past, and most of Netflix’s competition has either raised prices, included an ad-supported tier or both as a result.", "(FYI, I am leaving Amazon Prime Video, which said it will raise its annual charges by about 32% this year, out of the mix because the vast majority of subscribers pay for the free shipping, not the video.)", "HBO Max launched in 2020 at $14.99 per month and last year introduced an ad-supported version at $9.99 per month.", "NBCUniversal launched Peacock nationwide in July 2020; Paramount Plus launched in 2021 with limited ads for $5 per month; and Discovery Plus launched in 2021 at $4.99 per month with ads.", "Netflix has raised prices about 6 times since it launched its streaming video version in 2011 -- in 2014, 2015, 2017, 2019, 2020 and 2022.", "Each time there was a fear of a massive subscriber exodus that never came.

Netflix had its most watched show ever -- Squid Games -- in September and still managed to disappoint regarding subscriber growth.", "And this year it said it expects Q1 subscriber additions to be about 2.5 million, its lowest growth in years.", "And Q1 is usually one of the company’s biggest growth quarters.", "By their very nature surveys are worded in a way to find out what people are going to do, not what they’ve done.", "And when those questions are put to people while the wounds of a price increase are still fresh, or shortly after they've binge-watched a show and don’t think they’ll ever be anything else to watch, the answers are usually pretty harsh.", "That could very well be the case here. People are ticked off about another price increase, there are a lot of other lower cost choices around and none of them require long-term contracts, so people can drop them and sign up with abandon.", "But it does raise questions about streaming, which is turning out to be a lot like its predecessors in the video entertainment business, just trying to figure out the most convenient, cost-efficient way to deliver content to people who want it.", "Only time will tell who will come up with the formula that satisfies everyone's needs best. ■", "Mike Farrell is senior content producer, finance for Multichannel News/B+C, covering finance, operations and M&A at cable operators and networks across the industry.", "He joined Multichannel News in September 1998 and has written about major deals and top players in the business ever since.", "He also writes the On The Money blog, offering deeper dives into a wide variety of topics including, retransmission consent, regional sports networks,and streaming video.", "In 2015 he won the Jesse H.

First: the Netflix story is of course one of great success, only partially helped by worldwide lockdowns encouraging people to seek home-based entertainment, and to learn about its secrets sounded hugely enticing.", "Secondly, the publicity machine around this launch had provided sufficient glimpses to make me suspect that the Netflix way of working had a lot in common with the ‘self-managed’ organisations that I have a passion for.", "And thirdly, I loved Erin’s previous book ‘The Culture Map’, both for its content and for its engaging style.", "High expectations therefore, and as I was installing myself on the sofa for a binge-read of Netflix proportions I was not disappointed...", "Funnily enough, this is the second book in a row that I am reviewing, that has been co-written by two authors who each give their own perspective.", "Reed brings the business story and his personal lessons that led to him wanting to set up Netflix very differently from his previous company, as well as how that model subsequently evolved to what it is today.", "Erin provides at times a more theoretical context, but also a more independent and questioning view based on the more than 200 interviews she conducted in the company as well as her own professional background.", "That combination works best where Netflix workers are allowed to tell their stories and how they – mostly – embrace how the organisation’s principles work for them, but also how they had to get used to the more radical aspects, especially when coming from very different business cultures.", "Netflix’ foundational principles are coming down to a combination of Freedom and Responsibility (‘F&R’).", "The Freedom is expressed through high levels of autonomy, (e.g. employees being able to place big bets on things they believe in, without the need for higher-level sign-off), openness and absence of controls.", "The Responsibility side of the equation means that great ownership is expected for the decision you take, that frank feedback is given and received as a matter of course, and that your Netflix career is likely to be over if you are no longer considered a ‘keeper’.", "It all grew from Hasting’s experiences with his first business venture, a software company called Pure Software.", "Although in the eyes of most of us still a very successful business, Hastings was frustrated with the absence of innovation in the company as it grew larger.", "From a nimble, fun, entrepreneurial start-up, its success and resulting growth seemed to inevitably lead to more structure, more processes and procedures and a workforce that would suit that ‘safety-first’ environment best.", "Although the IPO of the company made Reed a wealthy man, he vowed that his next venture would not make the same mistakes.", "The second defining spark to Netflix’ culture was of a much more personal nature.

They don’t need approval, but they must seek advice from others who may improve the quality of that decision.", "This does not imply a search for consensus: the employee decides and takes full responsibility.

Consistently driving the workforce to be top performers: the Keeper Test", "‘Which of my people, if they told me they were leaving for a similar job elsewhere, would I fight hard for the keep?’", "That is the basis for the Keeper Test, a rather ruthless principle that Netflix applies every so often to ensure their workforce retains ‘premier league’ abilities and drive.", "So much ingrained is this principle, that employees (remember the spirit of frankness) even ask their managers how to make sure they stay on the Keepers list.", "Merely ‘adequate’ employees are asked to leave (with a generous severance package) so that the organisation can move on with its top performers.", "Cruel? Quite. I’m sure this is the most controversial of the Netflix practices, and one which would not suit every worker or go down well in many Western European countries.", "Do you like the Keeper Test? How about giving and receiving 360 performance feedback around the (dining) table with your colleagues?", "That is the Circle of Feedback practice that has resulted from the culture of openness as the next step in actionable feedback.", "As Erin rightfully says, it’s probably as attractive a prospect as going to the dentist regularly, but at Netflix they believe it’s worth it.", "With top-performing employees, you can now lead with context rather than controls, and let decisions be made where the knowledge and ownership are the greatest: at the frontline.", "At Netflix, any employee can make multimillion-dollar decisions themselves and take full ownership, without sign-off from higher levels.", "For that to work, all of the above needs to be in place, and the company focuses on setting and consistently communicating the context of where it wants to go.", "The main role of the hierarchy, therefore, is not to command and control, but to specify the context and support the employee, the ‘informed captain’, in arriving at and implementing her decision.", "The book’s 10th chapter (Part 4) deals with Netflix’ international expansion (currently 7,000 employees in half a dozen countries and its services available in over 130) and how its culture translates to other parts of the world.", "Unsurprisingly, from time to time it doesn’t. The stories involved are fascinating in how employees have found their way in dealing with it, and how Netflix found ways to be more open to the different perspectives of its now multinational workforce.", "Whether it’s about having short factual meetings versus building relationships, or whether feedback is delivered with or without a positive cherry on top, these are highly insightful anecdotes that most of us will recognise one way or another.", "The learning there is not only for those working in an international context, but also for those considering adopting some of Netflix’ concepts into a very different organisational culture.", "As a – business – book, this is a highly readable, binge-friendly book, well-written, with lots of anecdotes and personal voices in addition to some theory and various practical tips.", "It provides a great insight into what has made Netflix into this enormously successful venture and it will make a lot of other business leaders question which practices they can benefit from too.", "Read through the lens of self-management, and with the experience of working with Buurtzorg, one of the most successful self-managed organisations in the world, I recognised a lot of what Hastings preaches: on feedback and openness, on leading with context, on removing controls.", "I don’t know whether Netflix could be considered a self-managed organisation, but that is a somewhat academic question.", "Its practices show that these concepts can work at scale in a highly innovative, highly competitive market and that is an encouragement to those of us who share that conviction.", "I do have some reservations about the thinking behind some of Netflix’ principles and practices. For one, my experience is that openness and candour can work with any workforce, not just with an elite of highly talented individuals.", "As Reed admits himself, a framework and training is essential to make this work well, and that goes for any group of employees.", "Secondly, as Buurtzorg and others prove on a day to day basis, even in non-creative yet high-risk and complex environments, there are strong arguments for reducing ‘rules and process’ and trusting and supporting the workforce instead.", "Alternative controls and providing the right context often produce better outcomes than control proxies and best-practice straight-jackets.", "Finally, with ‘trust’ being the essential ingredient for any concept of self-management, I do wonder how well that fits with Netflix’ Keeper Test.", "It seems to work for them, but I would warn against it being adopted by your average company that lacks the foundation and organisational learning that Netflix built up over many years.", "All in all this book is a must-read for any progressive business leader.

What an exciting few weeks again that you and I and our listeners are going on.", "We are really getting a lunar powered moonshot, those of entrepreneurship at the moment.", "Mike Parsons: mark. I think it's a Blitzkrieg. I think it's a barrage of entrepreneurial, inspiration, insights, learning and habits.", "If you're still standing, you're probably five or six shows of entrepreneurial inspiration in a row. Mark.", "Mark Pearson Freeland: Today in show number 166, we're digging into Reed Hastings, CEO, founder of Netflix and Mike.", "I think it's fair to say that Netflix is a [00:01:00] brand that all of us have at least heard of. And the majority, the vast majority are likely subs subscribers.", "And this is a brand that actually surprisingly it's been around since 1995 is quite a long time ago. Now if you didn't know that", "Mike Parsons: well, Those of us on this show, mark that have a bit of gray head do remember the joy of the old DVD.", "So hence we have some long memories into those little red envelopes from Netflix, but boy what an exciting opportunity for us to delve into an enormously popular service.", "We were joking in the last show that Paul Graham has been part of so many products and services and companies over 3000.", "In fact, that we were pretty confident that our list.

Sometimes the lessons that we're learning from are in retrospect on the mic, we'll be hearing from individuals, maybe retelling case studies.", "We'll be hearing from a, an entrepreneur or a philanthropist at the end of their experience looking back.", "But you're right with Reed Hastings, he's building this brand and all of us can sit on our couches and actually watch the brand grow.", "Maybe some of us are owning some shares, some stock on the, on our phones and we're following the brand growing.", "And it's something that we can all watch and learn from.", "And it's fantastic to be able to get into read again today.

And it's really interesting because hailing from Silicon valley Reed Hastings and the Netflix success is not a purely technology story.", "What's really interesting is what we have to learn to get on the show today is that there is thoughts around culture.", "There is thoughts around continuous improvement even how he thinks about managing people like managing a sports team.", "And I think that's really. Really a different take on the world of technology. [00:04:00] In fact, it's quite similar to that of Paul Graham in the previous show.", "It's not just the idea. It's the founder. What Reed is saying. It's not just the tech, it's the people.", "And we've got the chance to learn all about that today.", "Mark Pearson Freeland: Yeah, I'm absolutely ready to go. Let's get back into Reed Hastings showy.", "Mike Parsons: Why not? So get ready to listen to one of the greatest brands of the modern age. Netflix.", "Let's hear the story of Netflix and more importantly, let's see what we can learn from the founder of Netflix.", "Mr. Reed Hastings. All right. I am ready to rock and roll. I am ready to get lights, camera action on the world of Reed Hastings and Netflix.", "And we are going to start with actually it's been a real delight. We managed to find a really good sort of introduction, clip for Reed Hastings and already in him telling a little bit of his story.[00:05:00]", "He gives us some insights in how to stay focused, to focus really on a destination. And I think just so all of our listeners know this is the clip is a little bit longer than normal, but it's going to set the scene for a really exciting show.", "So let's get into it. Let's listen to Reed Hastings and him having a north star.", "Reed Hastings: At the end of high school, I got a job selling rainbow vacuum cleaners, and I was telling them door to door in the Boston suburbs area.", "Of course, there's a couple of places I got thrown out of and other places where they want to, it was a fantastic introduction to selling.", "The lucky break in my life was getting into Stanford graduate school in computer science and. In the past, I had never met entrepreneurs and I'd put them on a pedestal, like they were godlike and all of these ways.", "And so it really helps to [00:06:00] be around some of them to see their regular people with a good idea.", "The thing I took away was with, if they can do it, I can do it. And I worked at a startup for two years.", "I have a typical 25 girl programmer. I have messy desks and lots of old coffee cups growing various fungi.", "And I went into work one day really early, and I caught the CEO. I'm cleaning my mugs in a bathroom.", "And I was like, oh, have you been cleaning my mugs all year? And he said, yes. And I said, why? And he said it was the one thing I could do for you.", "You do so much for the company. And so I ended up feeling a course. I got that. I would follow that guy off the ends of the earth.", "And I learned so much in that I realized leadership is pretty nuanced because there's the personally endearing part about character and followship in it.", "So the strategic part about not leading the company into a box canyon, I saw it was a really good lesson on the time that I started my first company, I was 30 [00:07:00] and everyone said, oh, I was so young.", "The fundamental is to be self-aware enough that you want to learn. And you learn through the criticisms and suggestions of others at pure software.", "The company's culture was not that strong. And that was the beauty for me of getting a start over with Netflix, because I realized that the trick in businesses, figuring out what scenarios could grow a week into a material threat because not all things will kill you.", "And if you get distracted dealing with every possible threat, you'll be very unfocused. I think of management strategy like chess, where a human chess player has to examine a couple of key strategies and mostly they're pruning the tree of possibilities.", "And if you prune correctly, you can see further down than the next person on the relevant paths.", "From the day we started, we knew DVD was going to die. And we named the business Netflix and our DVD by mail.com.", "So we had an advantage over blockbuster that had a really great business in [00:08:00] store rentals before it suddenly went away.", "But I wish we had realized how hard they worked, going to attack.", "And there was a multi-year battle for survival between blockbuster and Netflix. One quarter we shrunk because they were basically hitting us on price so hard.", "We underestimated them to our peril. And honestly, in hindsight, if they had started two years earlier and when we were that much smaller, they probably would have won, but they had quite a bit of debt, which constrained their flexibility and then ran out of money.", "The company is like jazz. You want players who can improvise arson because the climate is constantly changing and you're learning along the way, but you also have to have great judgment, like the chess player.", "So if you keep your north star, as how do I make the best product in this category for the people I'm trying to serve and then not get too distracted?", "Mark Pearson Freeland: It's a good long clip. I think that's a great introduction to read. It's honest, it's inspiring.", "It [00:09:00] reveals a few great lessons that he's stumbled upon over the years. But what I actually like about that clip is it shows his character.", "He's this honest open guy is all about thinking about challenges and opportunities from a management strategy perspective.", "Obviously he talks about the importance of having north star, which I love, but also he's referencing something that we'll visit a little bit more very soon in the episode, culture, as well as learning.", "He's he immediately references, seeing the CEO cleaning his car and then he references some of the lessons that they saw from their competitor.", "Blockbuster. It's a good clip ad illustrating the importance of us. Day-to-day looking around us taking everything in and noting where our competitors are, where our colleagues are, where the world is.", "I think it's a nice timely reminder there. What do you think, Mike?", "Mike Parsons: I thought he was how [00:10:00] Frank and down to earth was just the whole way he spoke.", "Like w he, wasn't his dislike us chatting. He's not like trying super hard to come across as a CEO. He's he seems really comfortable in himself, which I think is so important for leaders.", "I, what I like is how quick he is to point out. We got smashed up by, by blockbuster in the In a lot of his reference to learning.", "He talks about learning from failure, which I think is so important. It reminds us that it's not a dirty word.", "It's actually the most powerful thing if we choose to make it. And I just love that as it sets us up to talk about how you create a great culture, how you survive, the challenges that he mentioned, I think he's set us on the right", "And I think actually outside of the content, what that was a reminder to me of is just be yourself, just be the person you are.", "And that's a big part of leadership. And I think that's why he can tune into culture. So well, cause he's not spinning up his engines trying to be empirical or presidential, he's just being.", "Read, and that sets us up to talk about culture and how you bring it alive and how your frame of reference really needs to change as you grow your business.", "So we're gonna start by learning from breed how they actually, as a company, they get better as they get better.", "Reed Hastings: Yeah, I think everyone tries to build culture and values at first you have to [00:12:00] stage it with a company to the degree that you're 20 people and you've got no revenue.", "It's a very implicit culture. And you spend time on things that could kill you product market fit and that's appropriate.", "And then later, if you're Glen to last, then you say, okay, how do we make sure that as new people come in, the culture gets better.", "And one of the big things is probably this idea that you get better as you get bigger. So everyone implicitly has the idea that you start sucking as you get bigger, more political, harder to get stuff done, and you have to actively fight acceptance of that and come up with very concrete examples where like Netflix is significantly better in culture than three and five years ago.", "And then 10 years ago in 15. And why is because we got more brains thinking about the. This is where mouth is really went wrong.", "So of course, mouth is in the late 17 hundreds that everyone's going to starve because you look at all the people growth and you look at the fixed agriculture, and then they didn't realize that, you know what, basically, as the people grew, the [00:13:00] ideas to improve agriculture would also improve.", "And so we've had a massive explosion in agricultural productivity and the ability to feed 7 billion people, which he would be shocked by.", "And it's the same thing in company culture, which is if you have more if you have a thousand really thoughtful people thinking about how to improve, you make more progress than if you bet a hundred.", "And so we are actually getting better as we get bigger, but it's constantly changing the frame of reference.", "That's really what the leader does. That this is possible and that in fact we should aspire to it", "Mark Pearson Freeland: and make it happen. Yeah. There's this combination between having a leader who drives the direction simultaneously having a team around.", "Who are helping you prune those trees. So going back to the first clip read saying no matter how busy things get, you can always prune those trends away and see where you're going.", "It feels to me as though by combining leaders [00:14:00] as well as or the founders, essentially who may well begin with one really clear insight as to, okay, this is what we want to do.", "This is our product market fit. This is our mission statement. Once you start adding people around yourself, there is that risk of going a little bit off piece, but actually you are supported by your colleagues and by those thinkers and do, as they get placed around you as well.", "That's helping you along that journey on their mic.", "Mike Parsons: Yeah. So I guess the question is, so how do we do it? Like how do we contribute in a way.", "To our companies that they can get better as they get bigger. And the first suggestion I've got as I think about how can I do this is I think, treat every hire in the company as if it's the last person you're going to be able to hire cherish the [00:15:00] opportunity to hire and really be rigorous.", "And it reminds me a little bit of something mark Andreessen said, which is you're only as good as your worst person and what he means there is.", "If you hire someone who's not really a good fit, but you just want to fill the seat. Then you're dropping the level of the whole organization.", "And in a funny way, Reed is saying the same thing here.", "What he's saying is that every person should be adding to the brainpower thinking about culture and the behaviors of contributes.", "To that cold share and everything that they do. So for me, this is a huge reminder. Every person you hire is a contributor to the culture.", "When we add this person to the team, do they bring good thinking? Do they bring new thinking? Do these guys demonstrate a level of ownership that we really need someone [00:16:00] to come in and take hold of things.", "I think that's what he's reminding us to do. So my question for you mark now you've heard read, and he's talking about getting better as you get bigger with a big emphasis on the quality of the people, thinking about the problem.", "What do you take out of this? If you want to make the culture at QualityNet better, what are you what comes to your mind?", "Mark Pearson Freeland: I think it starts with. Being aligned and understanding what the business does.", "I think there's a F there's a functional logistic operational layer that I suppose, sets when you're sitting at home", "and you're reading the job description thinking, okay do I deliver X, Y, and Z, but also on the other side of that coin, there's an emotional one.", "And that's what I think is the really important thing to, to cultivate. [00:17:00] And I think what Reed has always demonstrated with his culture deck, and there's a lot of work online and interviews around the HR process for Netflix.", "When I think about my job and qualities and what I do with my team is okay how can I.", "Mo those around me, how can I help my colleagues? How can I ask better questions? How can I push their work forward?", "How can I be a really great team player getting us to that ultimate goal, whether it be a project being delivered or actually growing the company and the region.", "Mike Parsons: What's really interesting in this next clip.", "We've got Reed Hastings, literally laying down the key word and the key concept. Many people make the mistake of thinking that great business should be like a family.", "And I think what Reed Hastings has is a much better metaphor. So let's [00:18:00] have a listen to read, talking about culture and business and building a team.", "Reed Hastings: We're like a professional sports team and we want to win a championship in our area. And we're very honest with people that it's about performance.", "It's not about seniority. It's not about politics and working in Netflix. It's like being on an Olympic team and it's really hard, but you do your best work when you're surrounded by people who are really talented and try hard.", "And so we try to be very respectful, but it's fundamentally about performance for us. And we try to be clear about it because it's not for everyone.", "We want people who join Netflix to know how we operate. And the professional sports team is the closest analogy.", "Mark Pearson Freeland: Yeah. This for me rings. True. It rings very much to the core of [00:19:00] me actually, because when I do.", "Join a business or go and get assigned to a project, I think to myself. Okay what does it mean to me?", "How can I work as hard as possible? Because ultimately it may matters in everything that I do ladders up to the ultimate final delivery of whatever it might be.", "And I'm a firm believer in you get out of it, what you put in.", "So this analogy that Reed is using is a real driver for me because I'm thinking, okay if I am surrounded by the very best people and the very best players that right raises me up, I need to be performing to the best of my.", "I need to be trying as hard as I can. And that's probably a good motivator.", "I like that. I like being surrounded by that as a tool. Yeah.", "Mike Parsons: Yeah. It's not it's not unlike when you go to the gym and everyone's working out really hard.", "You instantly geez, I'm really getting into it today. [00:20:00] I think it's about creating an environment where everyone's 100% trying to perform doesn't mean you can't have fun, but when push comes to shove, people are really performing at their best.", "Now, obviously it's like executing tasks is very much what performance is about. And. It's also about ideas and the exchange of ideas.", "So I wondered my, when we talk about what he's really saying is the way he's built Netflix is it's a meritocracy, right?", "And when you think about what does it take to be great as a team in business, or if like me, you're totally addicted to the last dance, the Michael Jordan documentary on Netflix and ESPN.", "[00:21:00] When you look at what it takes to be a great sports team, what are some of the attributes that come to your mind?", "If you fondly remember your favorite sports teams or you remember moments in the office where we've been great what characterizes greatness?", "If we're like a sports team, what do we see? What are the behaviors? I think one of the real behaviors is driving for turtle alignment.", "So if I'm on a sports team to you to continue that analogy, I want to know that all of those around me are driving us towards the goal, the finish line, the the difference between staying where we are and elevating ourselves in the championship when I'm around business and colleagues, I think it's similar thing.", "Mark Pearson Freeland: I'm thinking, how do I. Stay [00:22:00] aligned with the business. How do I stay aligned with my colleagues and how do I help them if they are going to help me continue to play my best game?", "How do I support them without tripping anybody on the field?", "Mike Parsons: Yeah, I think you're absolutely right. Communication. Having coached rugby, what I can tell you is that one of the hallmarks of a great rugby team is they're always communicating their position where they are so verbally giving cues.", "I'm here. Another thing is calling plays. People understanding the place, having a plan and sticking to the plan.", "And I think the other thing, and we mentioned it a little bit earlier, is this ownership thing. If you own your performance and in doing so, know that if you're backing up your team, Even though it's their play.[00:23:00]", "If you're backing up and double checking, you might catch one or two little things in the office. If you just help someone review their work, double-check say let's do a quick review together.", "That to me is where one plus one equals three and that's team that's where you've got individual performance coming together.", "I think isn't it great that we can look at Reed Hastings and learn from him that it really comes down to performance and a focus on performance, but also doing that within a team context.", "I think it's really inspiring to see such a great company is truly built as a meritocracy built on merit, built on the things that you deliver, that you do, the way you play the game.", "Mark Pearson Freeland: Yeah, I really do. One of the things I enjoy most about work is when I feel. Of a product or a project when you feel empowered, you want to try your hardest and do your best work.", "And that's [00:24:00] very empower and motivating. Oh", "It's even better when the result and the outcome is really good", "now. So what's really interesting though, is that great sports teams like great companies can sometimes fall into the trap that they have one set of plays and they become obsessed with only playing that way.", "Like they become too scripted. They seem to lack spontaneity and creativity. Just like you might see in a sports team, you see it exactly the same app work", "Read is going to warn us over controlling or micromanaging the business. In fact, he's great challenge to us is that he describes the way [00:25:00] they work and you'll never believe it.", "He's going to talk to us about working on the edge of chaos.", "Reed Hastings: The great thing about being able to do two companies in my life is not making the same mistakes.", "So when the first company, as we grew and went public, we put in, excuse me, a lot of process because we had the idea.", "If we could just eliminate errors, think how good we can be. And so every time something went wrong, we put in a new process and we were so proud that we dummy proof the system.", "And what we didn't realize is if you dummy proof, the system only dummies want to work there.", "And so then the market changed and all of the kind of innovative, crazy thinkers had gone. And everybody was still, there was really good about following the rules, but the market had shifted, this was the rise of Java and the internet.", "And we were unable as a company to adapt. And that's when it hit [00:26:00] for me.", "Short-term optimization about being efficient is the death of long-term success and innovation. And that we should build a company in Netflix that tolerated some short-term chaos.", "And we manage right on the edge of chaos and the value of that is keeping and stimulating the amazing thinkers.", "Like DVD to streaming or licensed to expand to original content we have within Netflix, all kinds of original thinkers and that's the long-term optimization, but all of us in organizations want.", "And so that's really fueled the passion behind the culture deck, which is why short-term rules and process kill long-term health and innovation.", "Mike Parsons: that the freedom responsibility balance, instead of saying play by these rules, help people to", "Reed Hastings: be more adoptive. Absolutely because it focuses people [00:27:00] on having to think for themself.", "So we always want people to thank. And then when you attract thinkers, you're much more adapt because it's not following the rule book is how to succeed, decide to get into original content.", "I didn't, I thought it was about idea locally in freedom and responsibility, you trust the people you work with and Ted's around us, who was also a brown fellow.", "Reed Hastings: So Ted fell in love with house of cards and with the basic idea of moving into original content and said, trust me, it's only a hundred million dollars.", "And so I did, and he was worth it. And out of that, the world got house of cards.", "Mark Pearson Freeland: It's another great and quite meaty clip. There's lots and lots to delve into.", "It would have been a lot of fun to be there, to hear him do that speech. The areas that for me, Mike cert out is all [00:28:00] about not lacking spontaneity.", "I love this push by Reed for us to. Sometimes go and break the rules. That sounds like one of the main drivers of Reed's career.", "He does approach challenges as well as opportunities with a slightly different out of the box approach which I really realized that in a bit, but also throwing yourself at chaos.", "It's almost as though he's telling us, okay, go and find something that you see as the challenge to your business say streaming versus online DVD and how you sat at it, go and figure out how you might be able to get into that space.", "And I think that's a demonstration of his innovation and his way of thinking.", "Mike Parsons: Yeah the what he's talking about is [00:29:00] living somewhere between chaos and structure And particularly in a knowledge economy ideas of what, when, and then the structure to get them done is what brings home the money.", "I think what's really fascinating. Is he, the CEO thought something was a bad idea yet this other guy came to and said no, we should do this.", "It turns out to have been a huge win for them because not only was house of cards, massive, it opened up now and massive full frontal attack that they are doing on original content.", "Can you imagine that four years ago they weren't making their own shows at all and it now makes up a huge piece of their offering.", "Mark Pearson Freeland: Yeah. Netflix originals is huge. To be Frank, I have a feeling. That I may have even signed up originally back in the [00:30:00] day for house of cards, come to think", "Oh, there you go. Now let's bring this back to ourselves and to the listeners. Here's the challenge. How do we live and survive?", "How do we thrive in between structure and chaos? I think this is the challenge he's putting before us now.", "And what I'm going to propose to you is something that resonates so strongly with me, which is as long as you have a clear mutual expectation between yourselves, as colleagues and as a team.", "And when I say expectation it's like ownership, number one, communicating number two, curiosity, number three, and number four, desire to be an expert in something.", "If we all hold those values to be true. We don't need to worry too much about structures, because if you totally own the [00:31:00] outcome of the work that you do, and you're communicating, and sharing and collaborating and learning along the way, don't worry.", "It's all going to turn out good for me. Those are the pillars and which you can then let go on structure because you're so deeply aligned on values.", "And that's what this culture deck that he often refers to. And we've referred to, by the way, For all of our listeners we'll have a link to the culture deck in our show notes.", "It is well worth your while. In fact, Sheryl Sandberg said recently it's the most important document on the internet.", "She uses it a lot. I'm always using particularly the emphasis on highly aligned. So this is some some thoughts on, on, on how I think about living between there, but mark, how do you see yourself?", "What are the things did you do to live somewhere near the edge of chaos? How do you have just enough [00:32:00] structure and just enough freedom?", "Mark Pearson Freeland: Yeah, I do like your four columns, your four pillars. I think that's great. And just before I turn the mirror on myself, I think just to add to your pillars, it's nice", "Have those four pillars aligned for each individual. There is that trust, that foundation is so strong that you don't need to go really deep into logistics, planning and so on.", "Mike Parsons: between one another. Let me just double down for a second. If you have total ownership in you're a good communicator, I don't need to worry about you getting stuff because you will communicate that you're stuck.", "You will ask for help because you want to learn. And because you have the outcome of the work you're doing in mind.", "So it's not the classic thing of if I don't ask no one or tell no, because of those values, I don't need to worry.", "You'll just come to me when you've got a problem [00:33:00] that like, I can't tell you how important this is, how you live on the edge of chaos.", "But the thing is if you and I are working together and I haven't been explicit about my need for you to own something my need for you to communicate with.", "Then how can I have, how I'm I have no reason to have the entitlement of sitting in my seat and say, oh mark will reach out.", "If we never made that explicit at the start, then what's going to happen is something is going to go wrong.", "And we're all gonna find out about it too late. However, if you have alignment on values, how you want to behave with each other, that you will always take ownership.", "You'll always communicate. Then I can actually step back and say, I can give you space in this example and say, go for it.", "Cause I know you'll raise your hand if you're in trouble. This is essential to living on the edge of chaos.", "Reed talks a lot about it in the deck, but mark, let's turn it back on you. [00:34:00] How are you going to read?", "Mark Pearson Freeland: I genuinely believe that living on the edge of that blade of.", "Chaos and so on. It is it's thinking for yourself I think if I'm wondering, okay where, how far is too far?", "Am I leaning over one side or the other? Am I not challenging myself? And the opportunity enough? I will.", "I have to think for myself and challenge myself and question, okay what is it that I'm doing?", "And I think to tie into what you were just illustrating there, that's the empowerment, that's the ownership.", "So when I have received direction, when I have received that responsibility, it is then the ball is in my court to think for myself.", "So actually I feel very connected and quite aligned. I think that Blake and that line between the chaos is when you have that [00:35:00] total alignment between people that communication, the sports team.", "Hey, I'm over here, over there knowing where people are in. The individuals owning and thinking for themselves.", "And that's where I think I challenged myself and how I stay on the right side of boredom and chaos. So another thing is, I think this is such an important opportunity to share with our set amongst ourselves or with our listeners.", "Mike Parsons: I would propose this. I think whenever you're in a collaborative project and you find yourself starting to blame, even in the conversation in your head that you are blaming others, this should be a massive red flag [00:36:00] because what you're essentially doing is.", "Letting go reducing your sense of ownership and saying it's not my fault.", "It's their fault. They didn't do that because actually someone is a high-performance member of a high performance team will turn around and ask of themselves, what can they do to help that person perform better rather than hands in the air?", "Oh, not me. So I have this because I have this tendency for attributing blame.", "So I'm always like no. If I was the coach, if I have their performance really vested into my responsibilities, the question becomes, okay, what can I do better to improve their performance?", "What can I do better to contribute to them? Or maybe they just need a tip. Maybe they needed chat. Maybe they need a vacation who knows, but whatever it takes to help them getting back to before.", "That is that's the upside and the flag of when you're getting [00:37:00] away from that, when you're departing from the Netflix model, I think that's when you're starting just to point fingers.", "And for me, that's a big flag that I always call my cell phone so that we can still get to the outcome, regardless of who's up, who's down in terms of performance, we can all band together.", "Mark Pearson Freeland: No, I think that's really valuable. That's a nice insight too, to share. I think it can be very challenging to accept or be aware of one's own behavior.", "So the fact that it's one of the things that you fall into and therefore you've got the opportunity to then slap your hand and say, oh wait, hang on.", "I'm doing what I always do. That's quite a. Less than quite a good value and awareness add to have I don't know whether I could call off the top of my head a similar thing, to [00:38:00] be honest, but I do love that, that, that honesty there, I think he had on it for the next episode, I'll make sure I have a similar", "I just want to remind all of our listeners that we're at the kind of mid point of getting some really big ideas from Reed, how to live on the edge of cows, how we're really like a sports team and really every person you hire should be a net contributor to the culture to make you better.", "These are some fantastic things that we can get from read.", "Don't forget that we will have a link to the culture deck from Netflix in our show notes. And you can get those mark.", "Mark Pearson Freeland: moonshots.io. Right destination soon to be as large as Netflix, I reckon. I", "Mike Parsons: think so. Give us a couple of weeks and we're totally there. [00:39:00] So now we're going to make a little bit of an interesting pivot.", "We're going to go into things obviously related to culture. This is one of Reid's big things, but what we're going to do is move into a couple of things that are applicable on a very personal level.", "They might be habits or rituals that you can get into. And I think this is a very complimentary set of thoughts and ideas, inspiration from none other than Mr.", "Reed, Hastings, CEO and founder of Netflix. And this first shot in the arm for all of you, our listeners is about improvement.", "So let's have a listen to Reed Hastings to learn how we might always keep on. So then the question is read, what do you do to not lose the culture?", "Yeah. One of the most common questions new employee asks is how do we preserve the culture? And I say to preserve [00:40:00] something to pickle, it is the wrong solution.", "We're not trying to preserve the culture. We're trying to make it better. And it's materially better than it was five years ago.", "And I'll cite a couple of specific examples and then say what your job in addition to doing your role is to figure out how do we get even better?", "Because it's only when you struggled to get better that you really keep it vital that alive. So you always have to be saying, yeah, it's pretty good culture, but I'm sure it can be better.", "How can we be better? And so it's that struggle to improve that keeps it fresh.", "Mark Pearson Freeland: And not only is it a struggle or a a vision that reads talking about with business, I think it's also applicable to us as individual.", "For me, I can own my ability at being the best version of myself. I can own how much work I put into things, my performance, as well as my as you were saying, my [00:41:00] recognition.", "If I blame others it's all about this communication for planning. I like that clip because it's telling me, okay don't just sit on your laurels.", "Don't allow yourself to get caught up in the wind or the waves and let things just take you along for the journey.", "Make sure that your value adding and creating enormous. Difference for those around you as well as the business.", "Mike Parsons: Yeah. He's really reminding us not to stand still with me.", "Exactly. And so I love that the love the way in which he challenges us, that culture as an individual and as a group is it should always be improving.", "And my biggest sort of aha, as I think about how to embody this idea of always improving is whether you're talking about yourself or your team.", "Invariably, those are deeply [00:42:00] interlinked in a business setting. The key thing for me is to make small, but very regular improvements.", "Now, if I said to you mark, we must do 20% more projects every year. You would think to yourself that feels so daunting, right?", "Yeah. What, you don't want me to sleep. Come on. However, if I just said to you, how about every week we we improve our efficiency on projects by 1%.", "And then the following week, it's 1% the following week after that is 1%, actually that doesn't feel too hard to digest, but net, after a year of 52 weeks of improvement of 1%, every [00:43:00] single week, the outcome is actually pretty remarkable.", "And I think that if we do want to keep on proving, because it can feel change, can feel relentless. And I think it's when we just make it simple and digestible and immediate and That's when we can like, okay.", "Yeah, 1% better is okay. Okay. So we just have to do deliver this one, one document extra this week compared to last year.", "Yeah. Okay. All right. Let's see if we can do that, that's continuous improvement and it's just keep on trucking, be disciplined.", "And before you know it, after you, you're like, wow, have we improved? I think that's at the heart of what we can take that, so mark we're talking about this constant improvement, but you've got to have the right mental models.", "You've got to be thinking about things in the right way. And I think there's a lot to learn from net from Reed Hastings in this part to.", "Mark Pearson Freeland: Yeah, I really do. This is a nice clip that we're about to listen to because it references a little bit of the culture deck we've spoken about.", "We've briefly mentioned some of the methods and techniques they have when hiring for teams at Netflix here, it's a great lesson for us to take away in our day-to-day life.", "Encouraging us to stay curious and ask more questions.", "Reed Hastings: Is part of the interviewing process. Do you have essentially a culture check like this, but not like a checklist?", "Culture is always something that we interview for of kind of curiosity and. It's easy to find people who say,", "I love it. I really want to be there. What's harder as old what are the main things you disagree with and why and when we get a blank stare, we're like, okay, not really a first principle thinker.", "And when they say I thought the way that [00:45:00] you didn't talk about how to a culture rate and if I'm not great in day three, am I out or is there do you look at it like a athlete where it's over some time period to prove yourself?", "And if so, what's that time period. And why haven't you clarified that? They were like, oh yeah, that's a good insight.", "First principle thinker. So we're looking for people who are curious typically self-confident, and they're not they're questioning everything around", "Mike Parsons: Challenging because what Reed Hastings is effectively saying to a six here is not only do you need to be curious, but you need to be confident in your thinking.", "And what's really interesting is you can almost look at the gifts that we're getting from Reed, Hasting as one is in culture.", "But the second one is in this freedom of thought of thinking better thinking different.[00:46:00]", "This is where one read is giving us a lot, but to your this is a lot to digest, but what's also really interesting is how, the way you think and the way you behaving in the team as a culture, how interlinked that, the picture that read is really painting for us is that they're so interlinked.", "I find this quite surprising to see them so closely aligned. Are you.", "Mark Pearson Freeland: Yeah, I do. Every idea he's essentially saying every a day idea is up for debate.", "Even the culture deck, which we've now mentioned maybe a dozen times, which we're heralding as an amazing resource.", "What Reed's saying here is question it don't take everything and every idea for granted, and don't assume that everything is correct because what makes the best teams and the best employees is when you are a first principle thinker, when you were thinking, what can I add to this?[00:47:00]", "Yes. And where do we want to go with X idea? And I think that for me is it can be a bit of a challenge, right?", "It's quite challenging to hear an idea or a presentation or any sort of messaging or communication and naturally veer towards.", "How could I disagree with it? Because I think naturally we are trained to be quite accommodating with one another.", "And I don't think Reed's necessarily saying go out and challenge one another for the sake of it. I think what he's saying is don't just blindly accept something.", "Think about how you might be able to add to it because of your background, your upbringing, your experience, everybody has a different formula or model behind them that has led us to this point.", "And what I love about this drive and push towards being first principle thinkers is that's something that, again, you can own your own that ability, [00:48:00] right?", "Mike Parsons: We can learn a lot from Edwin Catmull, the founder of Pixar here, who we did way back in episode eight, feels like a lifetime ago.", "And he talked about creating safety of thought, because if people feel really safe in their thoughts, then they feel.", "Free and allowed to say things that might be contradictory to the defacto thinking and the bias within the organization.", "And what you're clearly seeing here is the opportunity for us to understand that if we can create a way for people to meaningfully discuss, maybe argue, maybe weigh up different factors and contrarian thinking, good things are going to happen when that happens.", "To some of Reid's earlier points. If you're just making everything dummy proof, then there's going to be no critical thought.", "Now what's really interesting about this is if you are [00:49:00] hooked on the Reed Hastings playbook, and then you're like, okay,", "it's about culture. It's being about better together.", "Living on the, educator's not micromanaging things I'm with you. You gotta be improving. You gotta be curious.", "But what he does first now is to talk about bringing everything together. You've got to have an sort of an organizing principle, like a central idea, a north star.", "And in the case of Netflix their north star is this idea of always delivering joy. So let's listen now to Reed Hastings talking about how Netflix delivers.", "Reed Hastings: We collect this year about $8 billion of customer's money. So thank you. All of you for giving us your money.", "And what we do is we say that money's in trust to create joy.", "We have to turn that into the most joy possible. And so we look and we say for every show, if a show [00:50:00] cost a hundred million dollars, how much joy, how much viewing did it create amongst all of you?", "If it cost 50 million or 200 million, of course you want different amounts of joy. And so we look at it as how much joy can we create of your money.", "And if we turn it into joy effectively, then you're happy and you tell your friends and we grow, and then we have more money next year to turn into more joy.", "So we're we think of ourselves like alchemists, we take in money cause outcomes, joy.", "Mark Pearson Freeland: It's a lovely little mantra because I feel quite connected again, w readers.", "Amicable and quite authentic and honest guy, and it's quite a, it's quite an unusual admission for somebody who's worth $4.6 billion.", "He is calling our loop. We take your money. It's great. But it's only an investment. We're funneling it into new content, new original TV shows and films.", "And ultimately the reason why it's not just to keep you entertained, but it's to [00:51:00] create advocates for the business.", "And I personally, I feel quite connected to that business because of this approach. And it's something that I'm sure almost every business does, including apple and so on, but I think Reed's awareness and acknowledgement of it for me, feels very inspiring and actually is something that I'm going to try and take away and think about when I'm doing projects now.", "It just feels a little bit more transparent, I think is the word.", "Mike Parsons: Yeah. And very similar to Bob Iger. In fact, and Bob is very focused on being a happy minute happiness machine at Disney.", "And he's really he celebrated the joy in which he felt in bringing that happiness to millions, if not billions, and in the same way, Netflix has it too.", "I think it's very similar. If you actually break down really great companies, such as [00:52:00] zoom video they have a really big vision about what they want to bring frictionless video and the happiness that can come through connection with others.", "It's really funny how there are just these incredibly simple yet simple, powerful human trues that often become the organizing principle of these insanely successful companies.", "And we're seeing it again here from Reed Hastings and Netflix. I think we've gone time for just one more clip, Mike, but we need a final thought.", "We need a closing argument for why there is so much to learn from Reed Hastings at Netflix. Where should we go?", "Mark Pearson Freeland: I think culminating a lot in what we've discussed.", "It's a lot about teams. It's transparency, it's collaboration, and for Reed and Netflix and even something that you referenced earlier, sometimes we all find it a [00:53:00] little bit hard to agree with colleagues and other people, but what is important to take away.", "And what Reed's going to tell us a little bit about now is it's important to see both sides of a point of view.", "So then you can model your behavior on the entire.", "Mike Parsons: Things get covered up cause people don't want to confront things. How", "Reed Hastings: does that work? We're never brutal. We're always honest, but we're always respectful and trying to, when we do the Stephen Covey seek first to understand then to be understood and we're always trying to tease out why would a good person do something?", "I don't seem to make sense. And so we ask, we're curious, we really don't have that academic kind of let's beat each other up and out of that will come the truth.", "We say, we're not like prosecutor and defense where they're extremist in the search of truth. We're more like the Supreme court where you try to take both sides of every issue and understand it.", "Mike Parsons: It's [00:54:00] on you seeing both sides and it's not always easy, but if you start with this idea that there's always two sides to a point of view, there's always two sides to an idea.", "This is really the essence of seeing pros and cons, the essence of critical thinking.", "And it's a bit sneaky of Reed. He's already told us a bunch today on how to think about culture and improvement and curiosity, even delivering joy.", "And then he comes with that one, mark. So question to you, Mike, how do we see both sides of", "Mark Pearson Freeland: the admission in ourselves that are our point of view or response is subjective?", "So I may not immediately see another person's point of view because I'm a product. Not only my upbringing, but maybe even my morning[00:55:00] I may have been distracted in the short term as well as the long-term.", "So I think what Reid's saying here, in order to be honest be curious be driven towards collaboration.", "We not only need to share and collaborate our sales to other people, but also be open when other people are offering or asking for a chance to collaborate with us.", "Mike Parsons: Yes. Yeah. And let's build on that for a while because I think you're absolutely right, but here's a couple of pragmatic things.", "Because I think I felt victim to loving my own ideas way too much in my early career, but I think it's always the starting point that people hold bias, our history and our current.", "Brings bias. So look at how different the women and innovations here, as well as to the media innovation series.", "And one of the things is that what you could clearly see is all [00:56:00] those women were fighting big battles before they got to the battle of the idea.", "Would you please listen right now that creates a bias on both sides of the equation? I think another thing is like once you know, that there's bias around, I think one of the great practical tips we can give our listeners is to distinguish the difference between an a, an opinion and a fact.", "The difference between fact and fiction is really important. And actually if you go into the art of critical thinking and we think about reads, telling us to understand is you can start with, Hey, we got bias to we really need to dig in there and actually work out.", "And then lastly, [00:57:00] to qualify if it is a fact to qualify it properly, or if it's an opinion to qualify that and what you will find in the search for truth and in, for the search of both sides of any argument is if you do a good job of, is that really the case?", "Show me, prove it to me. If that's your opinion, tell me how you got there.", "And lastly, qualify and understand the fact of the opinion before you jump to conclusion. This is very, this is a work in progress first, or I'm always trying to not jump five steps ahead, but just to methodically, take my time, gather the facts, gather the insights.", "But if we do that, I think we can start along that journey to understanding both sides of a point of view.", "Mark Pearson Freeland: I totally agree. I am putting my hands up. I very quickly [00:58:00] jumped to either conclusions or action.", "It's very easy to jump into saying I'm going to go and do this, but actually going to try to encourage my own being to take that beat, to ask those questions of another person's point of view so that I, myself can be curious read, selling us, always be learning.", "And when you don't. I have that tendency too, to listen. And instead of a tendency for action that's sometimes where things can come off the rails perhaps,", "Mike Parsons: and you can totally see how we get off track, because if we jump to conclusions and we only saw one point of view and we thought we are acted like the F the opinion was actually a fact.", "And we went and built this huge, expensive product only to realize it was built on that completely wrong insight.", "You see how that happens in [00:59:00] companies all the time. And so if you can have the art of critical thinking, seeing both sides of the equation, you can go a long way, maybe 182 million registered users, way Allah, Netflix, Marky, mark.", "Mark Pearson Freeland: good. That's a lot of claps. A couple of really meaty ones, a lot of tips. And what a series, the media innovator series Bob, mark, and read what a triumph for it.", "Mike Parsons: occasion? Imagine if you had that Motley crew around a dinner table with a glass of wine,", "Mark Pearson Freeland: the five of us around the dinner table.", "Mike Parsons: no prizes for guessing who would be the cheekiest. There's got to be mark Cuban for sure.", "Mark Pearson Freeland: Oh, it gotta be. You gotta be by then. Read is all about breaking the rules. It's", "Mike Parsons: all about finding then again, they may all behave because Bob's in the room.", "Mark Pearson Freeland: [01:00:00] I'll be making sure everybody's in bed on time he's the.", "Mike Parsons: Yeah. Yeah. Listen that brings us to the end of our media innovators series hot off the press following our women in innovation series.", "So all of those, you can get all the archives@moonshots.io, but ma we are just like Reed Hastings and Netflix.", "We are not standing still. We are thinking about what's next. And we, again, to go for the first time in a while, we're going to go deep on a three-part series on a one author.", "We are going to go deep into the world, or somebody here is, I would say he's at least a peer, if you will, of Simon Sinek mark Gerson, Freeland, who is next", "Mike Parsons: [01:01:00] our journey into learning from innovative.", "Mark Pearson Freeland: It is psychologist and Ted talker, Mr. Adam Grant", "Mark Pearson Freeland: prolific chap and somebody that we can't wait to sink our teeth into. He's going to be", "Mike Parsons: great. I think so. I think he is a relatively new entrance into this thinking differently space.", "I think I think he brings like a whole collection of great ideas about how business looks and feels in a post-industrial world in a knowledge economy we've got given take this quid pro quo idea and his first book, we've got originals.", "How nonconformists moved the world? Geez. I think we've had a few of those, none other than Reed Hastings himself.", "And then we've also got some[01:02:00] he, co-wrote a book option B facing adversity with Sheryl Sandberg, which sounds pretty on spec for the moonshots podcast, where we see a lot of brave courageous entrepreneurs, innovators, creators, and designers who have inspired us.", "Adam's going to lay out some frameworks and methodologies for us. This is going to be very Simon Sinek ask, but with a different twists mark, I'm fired up for.", "Mark Pearson Freeland: I can't wait. It's going to be fun.", "Mike Parsons: Super. It's going to be great. Super duper. Listen, we've exhausted ourselves going deep into the world of Reed Hastings and Netflix.", "We've looked at culture. We've looked at critical thinking to be a first principle thinker. How could you get so much from one chap?", "Don't forget. He's got a book coming out later this year, too, which will be fascinating. And then we will segue in our next show into the [01:03:00] world of Adam Grant.", "Mark. Thank you to you. Are you going to get an espresso after this?", "Mark Pearson Freeland: I think I will. I think I will. Maybe I'll a spark up Netflix tonight and see what Reed's got for me today.", "Mike Parsons: go. Listen, thanks again. Thank you to you. Thank you to all of our listeners. We're almost at a hundred ratings in the different podcast apps.", "And we have been popping up in all sorts of top 100 charts, which is just mindblowing to see from all four corners of the world.", "Looking at the list here we are popping up in the top hundred. In Cyprus, Jamaica, Mongolia year two, I Kenya Amania Hong Kong, Colombia, Israel, Finland, Thailand.", "It's incredible. And we've even popped up into the top 100 global business podcasts. If you can believe that number [01:04:00] 98 as of this morning.", "So thank you, mark tow you'll have been most well. Thank you to all of our listeners who have contributed so much show and going forth.", "Ping us at moonshots dot. This was the Reed Hastings episode 74 of the moonshots podcast. That's a syrup."]}

Dispassionate sackings. “Sunshining” failure.

That’s not a personal assessment, but the warning I receive in advance of our chat.", "If I’m planning to thaw him out, his handlers urge, I should make sure I’ve read his new book – No Rules Rules – about the somewhat terrifying workplace culture Hastings created at global streaming giant Netflix, a company governed by such ominous slogans as Adequate performance gets a generous severance package and its blunter corollary, Fire loudly, and with clarity.", "Apparently a few journalists didn’t read his corporate leadership tome in advance, and consequently got a cool reception from the author.", "The book is intriguing – from the radical candour feedback mechanisms the company uses, to the transparency process known as sunshining – but it’s just one source of research into the 59-year-old chief executive and co-founder of one of the biggest entertainment platforms on the planet.", "All of which makes the forewarning I receive curious.", "I’ve never been cautioned before an interview to do my homework: “Have you read the book?” I’ve never been given interview tips from a PR: “You might want to open with a few questions about the culture.”", "And I’ve definitely never been implicitly advised not to be late: “Punctuality is really important to him.”", "We’ll have only 45 minutes to talk, too – a limited window that the “intense” Hastings might (but probably won’t) stretch.", "In the end, following a digital diary snafu, I’m granted the barest half-hour.", "Hastings hates these things. He has ever since he sold his first venture – a software debugging company in the mid-1990s – and was featured in USA Today, photographed on the bonnet of a new Porsche Carrera under the headline “Boom!", "You are rich!” (Great headline though, he’d have to concede.) He told Vanity Fair in 2012 exactly how he felt about personality", "profiles: “I hate the photo shoots. I hate all that stuff. It’s an appropriate and necessary sacrifice, but on a personal basis, it’s pure downside, because then you just get more recognised.", "A normal life is unlikely for Hastings.

He’s already pivoted from DVD rentals to streaming, from local to global, from licensing to producing, helping bankrupt the Blockbuster video behemoth along the way.", "And he’s not just a tech nerd or C-suiter but a political animal, too, whether backing his favourite politicians (tipping in dollars as a “Hillblazer” for Hillary Clinton in 2016; co-hosting a fund-raiser last year for Democratic wunderkind Pete Buttigieg) or pouring his philanthropic bucks into an ailing US education system he thinks could use a little disruption.", "Let’s not forget his net worth, either.

His father was a lawyer, his grandfather on his mother’s side a renowned physicist.", "“But I was definitely not a stand-out kid; I was a late bloomer,” he says. “All through high school, a B student.", "Not an athlete, not that social, but I wasn’t super dark and miserable.”", "In 1978 he went to Bowdoin College, a small nearby liberal arts school, where he discovered an aptitude for mathematics.", "He loved being great at something, fell particularly hard for self-paced classes, and has said that “calculus was my first binge”.", "He once told The New Yorker he had no hobbies and was a “pitiful failure as a Renaissance man”, yet he had an intrepid streak at university, running the Outing Club, organising hikes and canoeing trips.", "He spent one summer in a Marine Corps boot camp, too, before ultimately joining the Peace Corps – teaching maths to teenagers in Swaziland.", "It felt purposeful and worthy, at least at first. In his second year in Africa he spent his afternoons playing cards and drinking beer.", "Letters from that time – archived at his alma mater – reflect a growing sense of stagnation: “I would never dribble away my days at home like this.”", "He began to consider studying artificial intelligence at graduate school. “I loved the kids, but I wanted more intellectual stimulation than teaching algebra every year,” he says.", "His big lucky break was getting into the master’s of computer science program at Stanford University in 1985, after which “life took off”.", "In 1991 he started his own software debugging company, which merged with a similar company founded by his friend Marc Randolph.", "Randolph currently works as a mentor to the founders of new start-ups but has another claim to fame as the original Netflix CEO.", "The first time he truly met Hastings was a week after their companies joined, on a flight from Los Angeles to New York.", "“Within three minutes of the stewardess bringing around the peanuts and the soft drinks, Reed swivels 90 degrees in his seat, leans in, and starts on this incredible dissection of the business, of the category, of the competition, of the challenges they were facing,” Randolph tells me, on a video chat from Silicon Valley.", "“This thing went on for five hours. It was the most incredible synopsis I’ve seen. He was not someone to spend half the flight chit-chatting about sports.”", "Eventually their combined company was acquired by another for $US750 million. “We were both out of a job,” Randolph says, “but in that wonderful Silicon Valley way where you stay on for six months to advise.”", "The pair would carpool into the office for an hour each day – rides that became brainstorming sessions about their next business.", "Considering the success of Amazon with books, they wondered if it could work for videos. This was the summer of 1996, and Hastings was fuming over $40 in late fees after renting the Tom Hanks movie Apollo 13.", "DVDs were being test-marketed in a number of cities, and a light bulb went off: could this thinner, lighter format be rented cheaply by mail, instead of forcing customers to line up at the local video shop?", "They went to a music store in Santa Cruz and bought a used Patsy Cline CD, then mailed the disc to Hastings’ house in a square blue greeting card envelope.", "A day later, Hastings came to pick Randolph up for work, with the envelope in hand. “He didn’t even need to say anything,” says Randolph.", "“That was the moment we said, ‘Huh, this just might work.’ ”", "Netflix opened in 1997, and its rental model began its irresistible creep across the country. Customers could curate a queue of films online, and Netflix would post them one at a time (with no late fees).", "It sounds quaint now, but was a massive disruption then, and hugely popular.", "Hastings was already looking beyond. Ted Sarandos, his current co-CEO, remembers meeting him in San Jose in 1999, and listening to a lengthy dissertation on Moore’s Law: the theory of exponential growth in computing power.", "“Reed was talking about how all filmed entertainment would one day be delivered directly into homes through the internet.", "That was a very abstract idea back then!” says Sarandos. “I’d never met anybody like him.”", "It’s worth pointing out that Hastings was not sold on life as an entrepreneur. He was actually wrestling with the idea of an advanced degree in education to reform that field.", "“He was not someone who was dreaming about miniscule tweaks, but substantive changes,” Randolph notes.", "“He used to say to me, ‘If you really want to change the world, you’re not gonna do it with millions, or even tens of millions – you’re gonna do it with hundreds of millions.", "Netflix never completely drew Hastings away from education. He remained a California State Board of Education member, campaigning for charter schools (independent schools with specialist curricula and fewer regulations).", "In 2016 he created the Hastings Fund – $US100 million for various education programs – and in June this year he donated $US120 million for scholarships at two historic black colleges and the United Negro College Fund.", "He’s now building a conference centre for educators near the Rocky Mountains, to provide public school teachers with a space for training and leadership courses.", "I wonder if he sees the disconnect between his passion and his business – the latter encouraging people to “Netflix and chill”?", "One of his favourite jokes is that Google co-creator Larry Page is trying to make the world more productive, while Hastings is trying to make it less productive.", "He laughs. “People need learning and work, but they also need great release,” he says. “We want to win your preference with something that can move you to laughter, move you to fear.", "It’s that emotional stimulation. You’ve still gotta work, you’ve gotta eat, you’ve gotta have social relationships.", "“He is not a naturally empathetic guy. He’s not a bad person – he just doesn’t feel what others feel.”", "As the company scaled, he needed to evolve as boss. Patty McCord, who was chief talent officer at Netflix for 14 years, remembers him leading at first like a software engineer, blissfully unaware of the gravity his passing opinions might hold.", "“I had to remind Reed, ‘You know when you casually walked by and made that comment about how you would do the font on the homepage differently?", "You just redirected the entire design team to redo the website.’ ”", "There was an acknowledged bluntness in his manner – “You can always know where you stand with Reed,” says McCord, “but you might want to be sitting” – that was never more true than in 2001, just after the first dotcom bubble burst.", "Netflix wasn’t yet listed on the US stock exchange (that would come the following year) but it was losing millions due to rising expansion costs.", "It had to lay off around 40 employees, a third of its staff.", "Randolph says it was wrenching, but Hastings was dispassionate. “He is not a naturally empathetic guy,” says Randolph.", "“He’s not a bad person – he just doesn’t feel what others feel. The dominant mode for him is, ‘It would be irrational for us to keep someone on, just to keep us from hurting them.’ ”", "That mindset was franked by what happened after the sackings. The remaining 80 workers adjusted, and the office became a passionate, buzzing hive.", "Hastings calls this his “road to Damascus” experience, informing the creation of what the company calls the Keeper Test, which requires all managers to ask: Which of my people, if they told me were leaving for a similar job at a peer company, would I fight hard to keep?", "These were the beginnings of the Netflix culture deck, Freedom and Responsibility, written by Hastings with McCord over a decade.", "Initially used to orient new employees to the company, eventually Hastings shared its methodology more widely – much more widely.", "“You did what?!” McCord screamed at the time. “We’re going to scare off all our candidates!” Hastings’ reply: “Only the ones we don’t want.”", "The 126-slide presentation went viral. Facebook chief operating officer Sheryl Sandberg later said it may well be “the most important document ever to come out of the Valley”.", "It became a recruiting tool, and the cultish personality of the company was born. Its workplace wouldn’t be a “family”, for instance, but something closer to a professional sports team.", "“I just started pushing that metaphor,” says McCord. “If you’re my centre forward and there’s a better one out there, I have to do the right thing and hire them instead.”", "Radical candour was next, namely the directive that workers should Only say about someone what you will say to their face.", "Personal feedback was instilled into everything, becoming an agenda item on every meeting, not to mention Live 360s, sessions in which a group gives an individual a thorough round of (constructive) criticism.", "“There’s definitely a tension between kindness and honesty,” says Hastings, nodding. “We humans want both to be kind and to be honest, and you try to do the best job of being both, but it’s hard …", "But I don’t want to soften a message so much that it’s not heard accurately.”", "He says the feedback is bottom-up as well as top-down, but I struggle to imagine how that works. Underlings don’t often critique the head of a $US200 billion global company.", "Hastings says psychological rewards are crucial – tough feedback must be met with immediate thanks. “And it gets easier.", "Think about it like exercise – if you don’t exercise a lot, then you try to bike up a mountain, it really is awful, you feel sick.", "But if you work out a bunch, you know you’re getting stronger and you push yourself. I’m not saying it doesn’t hurt sometimes, but it can be a productive hurt.”", "It provoked an unprecedented customer revolt. Almost a million subscribers left. Employees quit in droves.", "The company rose, introducing streaming in 2007 before its competitors, and when Apple launched the first iPad in 2010, Netflix was one of its featured apps.", "But the upstart company was also openly disparaged. Time Warner chief executive Jeff Bewkes infamously sneered about it to The New York Times: “It’s a little bit like, is the Albanian Army going to take over the world?", "I don’t think so.” (Hastings wore that slight, quite literally: “For the next year, I wore Albanian Army dog tags around my neck,” he said at the time.", "Unfortunately, a debacle of his own making was close, the result of what people say is both his greatest strength and greatest weakness.", "“For Reed, if the instinct and the data is there, the decision doesn’t need to be worried about,” says McCord.", "And that’s what happened in 2011. Hastings decided to halve the company: Netflix would do streaming, and a new service, Qwikster, would handle its DVD rentals.", "Instead of a single $US10 per month fee, it would charge $US8 for each service (a six-dollar price hike overall).", "It provoked an unprecedented customer revolt. Almost a million subscribers left. Employees quit in droves.", "The Netflix stock price dropped by 75 per cent. Hastings jumped online to explain: “I messed up,” he wrote.", "“I offer my sincere apology.” There was a ham-fisted video apology, too, mocked by Conan O’Brien and spoofed on Saturday Night Live.", "An unmitigated disaster, Qwikster was hastily withdrawn.", "Erin Meyer, the co-author of No Rules Rules, knows precisely why the episode played out this way. “Reed’s very, very smart, and he’s right most of the time, and he gets ahead of people, and he will cut short a discussion and be impatient about waiting for people to catch up with him,” says Meyer, speaking from Milwaukee.", "“Qwikster is the people around him thinking, ‘He must be able to see things we can’t see.’ ”", "A chastened Hastings began using the words “probation” and “penalty box” to describe his status in the company.", "He took a team of 60 executives and directors on retreat to a Colorado ranch, where they sat in a circle sharing the lessons learned.", "“We were very much in the middle of nowhere, there’s cliffs and cowboy-type stuff around, and you’ve spent the four days together arguing about all sorts of things, and this was the summary moment,” Hastings tells me.", "“We’re kind of half-recovered, but we’re still fragile. I thanked everyone for managing their own anger – they must have been angry at me.”", "Then he broke down, tearful for their support. And managers came forward, confessing they knew Qwikster would flop but hadn’t plucked up the courage to challenge him.", "From then on, another mantra was nailed to the wall: If you disagree with a Netflix idea and do NOT express that disagreement, you are being disloyal to the company.", "They now test out new plans by casually socialising ideas with peers, or actively farming for dissent.", "If something fails, they work on sunshining that mistake: explaining what happened and why, so everyone learns.", "(They even keep a file of historic follies to show new employees.)", "Transparency became king, often at the expense of privacy. When someone is fired, for instance, they can’t say they quit, and staff are told why.", "Personal problems like alcoholism are shielded from peers, but never performance issues.", "They hold weekly “all hands” meetings, too, where they share detailed company information, from high-level strategy to valuable quarterly financial information – data that could be illegally traded upon.", "It’s a risk, admits Hastings, but the reward is staff who feel trusted. In the book, he offers a memory hinting at why he went down this road.", "He was 19, and his college roommate opened up about being a virgin. Hastings was, too, but said nothing, later learning how his silence had hurt his friend.", "“Keeping secrets,” he now writes, “is not good business.”", "As Netflix went global, the company rules had to be adapted. Copious positive feedback smacks of insincerity to Germans, while bald negative feedback can be insulting to the highly indirect Japanese.", "Hastings seems well equipped to face the world. He tells a story about his time in Swaziland. It was 1983, and he set a problem for his 16-year-old students.", "A room measures two metres by two metres: how many 50-centimetre tiles would it take to cover the floor?", "None could answer. Hastings grew frustrated. Then a boy, Thabo, raised his hand: “Mr Hastings, sir, please, what is a tile?”", "His students had grown up with dirt floors. “That lesson in that moment taught me so much. I’m more thoughtful than I would be otherwise about context,” he says.", "“When someone doesn’t get something, I don’t go to, ‘They’re not smart.’ I think, ‘What am I not explaining right?’ ”", "He’s needed that perspective when it comes to content, too. Netflix began expanding overseas in 2010, first in Canada.", "In 2011, it went into Latin America. From 2012 it moved into Europe and, in 2015, Australia and the Asia Pacific.", "In 2016 it made its platform available in 130 new countries in one day. This naturally led to concerns about homogenisation of culture – about the rest of the world taking their cultural cues from American programming.", "In fairness, the company now produces content in 20 countries, including some of its biggest recent hits, from Dark (Germany) to Money Heist (Spain).", "Hastings foreshadows a day when that great historic obstacle to big audiences watching foreign content – the subtitle – may no longer be needed.", "“I think most of the future will be dubbing,” he predicts. “Think of deep fake technology, and getting lip synch to be better so you don’t even notice.”", "That’s not really a concern in Australia, of course, where former ABC executive producer Que Minh Luu has just been appointed the first “director of local originals”.", "She’s only been in the gig two months, but knows what she wants. “It’s gotta be Australian, it’s gotta have an Australian point of view, and it’s gotta be for Australian audiences,” Luu says.", "“If it travels, great, but the remit is very much sitting in the local space – making stories by us for us.”", "Exactly how many stories is the question people are asking. Free-to-air broadcasters in Australia are compelled to screen a hard quota of local content, but Netflix has banded together with competitors Amazon, Disney and Stan (owned by Nine, the publisher of Good Weekend) in lobbying the federal government to let them negotiate confidential voluntary targets instead.", "Resisting a hard quota, Netflix likes to point out it has already invested $110 million in Australian children’s programming in four years (from The Inbestigators to Bottersnikes & Gumbles), as well as making “invisible investment” in adult shows co-produced with local networks (such as ABC programs The Letdown and Pine Gap), plus “unscripted” content such as comedian Hannah Gadsby’s smash stand-up special Nanette.", "“We’re producing great content without a quota now – it feels really positive and assertive,” says Luu.", "“People are actively curious about what we want to do and what we want to make, and the message going back is, ‘What story do you want to tell that you haven’t been able to tell before?’ ”", "For the talented Tony Ayres (screenwriter and showrunner, director and producer), that story is the social media thriller Clickbait.", "Ayres took it to buyers in Los Angeles last year, where Netflix used its formidable clout to “blow everyone else out of the water”.", "In production now, the $54 million project is his first Netflix Original, but he points out that other Australian shows such as Glitch would never have happened without co-production investment from Netflix.", "The streamer also recently licensed a handful of shows Ayres has worked on in the past, from Stateless and Wanted to Nowhere Boys, getting them into the once notoriously inaccessible American market, and beyond.", "“It’s satisfying to have another door to knock on, and then when you go through that door it’s a little like, ‘We’re not in Kansas anymore’,” Ayres says.", "Not everyone is happy to let streaming services dictate how much local content they produce. Communications Minister Paul Fletcher will answer the quota question later this year, promising that “harmonisation” measures will be rolled out slowly, after he reveals a rough direction for any new laws.", "That can’t come soon enough for legendary Australian producer John Edwards (Tangle, Love My Way), who says access to our market must come with a cost.", "“That’s the quid pro quo, and it’s served us very, very well,” Edwards says. “There would have been no Offspring without a quota.", "There would have been no Secret Life of Us without a quota. It goes on and on – great Australian shows that were only made because the buggers had to make something Australian.", "“Think about it, when you watch a show from Netflix and you get addicted to it, you stay up late at night.", "This is all going on, of course, in the shadow of the COVID pandemic. With much of the world facing no concerts, closed movie theatres and shuttered plays, millions are stuck at home, glued to the telly, so it’s no surprise that Netflix added more than 10 million new subscribers worldwide between April and June this year.", "Its production pipeline briefly stalled, but because it works so far in advance – sometimes years – and shutdowns have varied throughout the world (Western Europe is back in full-blown production; Korea and Iceland didn’t shut at all), the impact will be minimal.", "The other backdrop, of course, is the “streaming wars”. Netflix is the global default leader but not in every locale.", "In India, for instance, its five million subscribers badly trails both Amazon (17 million) and Disney+ Hotstar (18 million).", "In Australia, according to technology analysts Telsyte, Netflix has 5.4 million subscriptions, Stan 2.1 million, Amazon’s Prime Video 1.7 million, and Disney+ 1.1 million.", "Each has its own strategy. Stan entered the market first and pushed local content hard. Next was Amazon, its Prime Video tapping into a sports-mad nation with its cricket docuseries, The Test, and embedding film crews with AFL clubs.", "Last year came Disney+, which relies on its massive back catalogue while also owning or buying the rights to one-off “event” programming such as the hit American stage show Hamilton.", "Local TV networks are improving their own streaming apps, too, from ABC iView to Foxtel Go.", "With a glut of providers, Sydney media analyst Peter Cox warns that casualties are coming. “The fundamentals don’t add up,” Cox says.", "“You need to dominate the market share and make a monopoly product – and these companies aren’t achieving that.", "It will be a battle. There will be a lot of money lost in the process. The bottom line is we’ll end up with blood on the carpet.”", "I’ve seen this kind of analysis put to Hastings in the past. His response never varies. Netflix may have spent $US2 billion on marketing this year, but he doesn’t see it as competing with Apple TV or YouTube Premium or Fortnite, but a much greater foe, which he identified to investors in 2017.", "“Think about it, when you watch a show from Netflix and you get addicted to it, you stay up late at night,” Hastings said.", "Thirty-five years ago, Wilmot Reed Hastings jnr wrote a wistful letter home, as his time in Swaziland came to a close: “Will I ever again race across the hot savannah, bare chested, motorcycle purring, admiring the acacia trees heralding ‘This is Africa?’", "People now wonder if he has a similar bittersweet yearning – for a life untethered to work. Sarandos was appointed co-CEO earlier this year, so the retirement question keeps coming.", "“No, not yet!” he pleads. “I’m here for another decade at least and couldn’t be more excited about what we can accomplish around the world.”", "Yet he has paused to smell the odd rose, joking with friends that his work life is now cutting ribbons and kissing babies.", "He’s softened. He still charges wildly into conversations, but apologises readily and without qualification.", "When he goes to the Sundance Film Festival, he doesn’t wheel and deal and gladhand, but watches movies from 8am to midnight.", "Once obsessive about the perfect 26-second espresso shot, he now values the simplicity of a house wine with a bowl of penne.", "What then disturbs his calm – what could disrupt the disruptor? Virtual reality technology perhaps – or screens embedded into contact lenses?", "“The main risk is taking things for granted,” he says. “You may not know what the threat is, but there’s always threats out there.”", "Focusing on his subscribers from all over the world is all he and his company can do. The lofty goal isn’t winning the commercial war, he says, but trying to end our prevailing human afflictions.", "Seriously. Reed Hastings wants to end boredom and loneliness. “That’s hard though,” he says, laughing.", "“We’ll see what we can do but those are very resistant conditions!”", "Time almost up, there’s a final question I can’t resist asking: When is the next season of Stranger Things coming out?", "His answer is what you might expect from a man with only 30 minutes to spare. “I’m happy to share that with you but … sorry, have to run now.”", "To read more from Good Weekend magazine, visit our page at The Sydney Morning Herald, The Age and Brisbane Times."]}

In 2009, Reed posted this culture deck, which up until that point had been internal, publicly online.", "And it caught fire. It has now been viewed tens of millions of times. And one of those tens of millions of views … was me.", "ALEX: I’m really excited to talk to you because I -- you know, five years ago I started my own company after not ever having done anything like that for my whole life.", "And ah… and our company has gone through and is in the midst of some growing pains that I feel like your very famous culture deck identifies perfectly.", "So I can’t wait to talk to you about that experience for you and the experience for us.", "PATTY: Yeah, we get an interview and a free consultation session, this works out great.", "ALEX: Exactly! You figured it out. In fact there is no podcast, it’s all a ruse.", "I’m very excited to bring you my conversation with Patty McCord. We get deep into the ideas that she layed out in the culture deck later in the episode.", "But we started at the beginning. Before the culture deck, before Patty was an HR maverick. Back when she was an HR traditionalist, in the ‘80s, when she had a succession of jobs at big technology companies.", "She worked as a recruiter, she headed diversity programs for Sun Microsystems.", "And then in the early ‘90s she was looking around for a new job. Something exciting, with a little more promise.", "And she found out that a colleague of hers had gone to a start-up that was run by an impressive young CEO… Patty wanted in.", "PATTY: I said, \"You know, you should hire me to run H.R. for that company.\" And he said, there's nothing I can do about it.", "The CEO's name is Reed Hastings.\" And I hung up the phone. And back in those days what you did was you dialed *69", "PATTY MCCORD: So it redialed, and Reed's sister who was the receptionist answered the phone, and I said, \"May I speak to Reed Hastings?\"", "ALEX BLUMBERG: Did she connect you to Reed Hastings?", "PATTY MCCORD: I said, \"You don't know me but you should, because I'm going to be -- I'm going to run H.R. for you.\"", "And he said, \"Fine. Then, you know, get an appointment. Talk to you later.\" And when I had my interview with Reed, he asked me about what my H.R. philosophy was.", "And remember at the time, I spoke fluent H.R. I mean, I'd worked at Sun Microsystems.", "ALEX BLUMBERG: And Sun Microsystems was, like, how many employees? That was like thousands of employees?", "ALEX BLUMBERG: So you were running big corporate ...", "PATTY MCCORD: Big corporate H.R., right? And so I said something like, \"You know Reed, I believe that it's -- it's of huge importance for each individual to draw a line to the corporate vision by being empowered and engaged,\" and whatever.", "And he looked at me and he said, \"Do you people even speak English? Did that sentence make any sense to anyone on the planet?\"", "And I got riled up and I said, \"Well you know, you don't know me. What a dumb question to ask about my philosophy…”", "ALEX BLUMBERG: Wait, so you fought back with him though, in that moment? You were like ...", "ALEX BLUMBERG: And you're calling my answer stupid? I'm going to call your question stupid.", "PATTY MCCORD: I was like, you know, \"Ask me a better question then, if you want a better answer.\" And so I came home and my husband said, \"How did it go?\"", "And I said, \"Well you know, I kind of got in a fight with the CEO.\"", "Turns out, didn’t matter. Reed Hastings was impressed with Patty even though she fought with him in the interview… or maybe because she fought with him…", "Now the company that Reed Hastings was starting back then was NOT Netflix. This was the company he started before Netflix.", "It was a company called Pure Software. It was a real estate holding company. Just kidding. It was a software company.", "And Pure Software grew quickly... buying up its competitors.", "PM: Every time we acquired another company, we would double. So we were a hundred, two hundred, four hundred, eight hundred, you know, sixteen hundred.", "And that part of the story is really important, because how we operated was I would take their employee handbook and our employee handbook and I would smash it together and try and create as few policies as we could that would piss off the fewest amount of people.", "But, you know, the policy manual became two or three volumes. And we spent a whole lot of time in a whole lot of meetings discussing should our e-mail be PMcCord at, or Patty dot McCord at, or -- I mean, it was just this endless bureaucratic policy nightmare.", "ALEX BLUMBERG: Uh huh… // I’m going to ask the question you said Reed was dumb for asking… At that point had you started to -- had you started to develop a philosophy of H.R.?", "ALEX BLUMBERG: If you had to outline the philosophy of standard HR, what would that philosophy be?", "PATTY MCCORD: Well it's different in every company, but there's a baseline that says, \"We make the rules and people follow them.", "And we're in charge.\" You know, it changed over time in my H.R. career from being, \"We make the rules and people follow them,\" to \"We're protecting the company from those evil employees that might sue us,\" to, you know, the HR global initiative du jour to, \"maybe we should make them extraordinarily happy.", "Patty stayed at Pure Software, practicing standard HR and feeling a little ambivalent about it, until, eventually, after acquiring all of those other companies, it was Pure Software’s turn to get acquired.", "And an acquisition can be emotionally complicated for the company getting acquired. It can mean success, money, but also, it can be bittersweet.", "The thing we built, our baby, it has a new owner. What are saying goodbye. It can feel like a loss. But what Patty noticed, she and Reed, they had almost none of that second feeling.", "They weren’t really sad. In fact, Patty wondered at the time, why are we not sadder about this? And she noted that lack of sadness.", "And then, she moved on. She started consulting. Building herself a new career. And one day, she ran into Reed again.", "PATTY: So I'm driving in a parking lot of a strip mall here in town one day in the -- early in the morning, and I see Reed with his kids in his double stroller.", "And I said, \"What are you doing?\" And he goes, \"Well, I'm taking the kids for a walk.\" And I said, \"To OfficeMax?\"", "And he said, \"I just bought this postage meter and, you know, I found that I can mail CDs to myself and they don't break.\"", "And I said, \"What?\" And then he told me the idea of Netflix DVD-by-mail, and I really -- I remember thinking I should be nice to him, because it's a really ridiculous idea.", "PATTY MCCORD: Yeah, I know. It just -- it was just so implausible.", "ALEX BLUMBERG: If everybody else saw it, it would have happened already.", "PATTY MCCORD: Right, if it was obvious, somebody would be doing it.", "Now this, remember, was pre-high-speed internet. And back then, the way you rented movies was by going to Blockbuster.", "Remember Blockbuster… it was an actual store. You’d walk into it. They’d rent you videos that you’d play on a thing called a DVD player.", "Reed told Patty he was building a competitor to that. A movie rental company that would send you DVDs through the mail.", "He was calling it Netflix. And a short while after running into Patty in the parking lot, Reed called her and asked her to come help him build it.", "PATTY: When he called me and asked me to come to Netflix I said, \"No, it's a really dumb idea, and secondly I'm consulting now.", "I make a bunch of money. I'm home a lot. My kids know my name. I mean, why would I do this?\" And he said \"Let's create the kind of company that if it was successful we'd still want to work there.\"", "And I'm like, \"Wow! That's -- that's compelling.\" And I said, \"If we did that how would you know?\" Right?", "How would you describe it, Reed?\" And he said, \"I'd want to come in the door every day and solve these problems with these people.\"", "ALEX BLUMBERG: Oh, he would -- it would be like, I would want to come into work every day excited to solve the problems before us with the people around the table, in other words.", "PATTY MCCORD: Good. Perfect. Yes, exactly that. And so he asked me what would my, you know, my nirvana play be", "and I said, \"Wouldn't it be cool if we were a great company to be from?\" You know like, we were like an Apple or a Microsoft or, you know, whoever.", "Where you saw the name on your resume and you thought, \"Oh, that's cool. You were there.\"", "For an HR maverick in the making, it was an enticing vision. So Patty joined Reed at Netflix… And for the first couple of years, it was a scrappy little company taking scrappy measures.", "PATTY MCCORD: We literally took everybody in the company out in the parking lot every Friday, and we went through basically what was the executive dashboard, right?", "We would walk them through the P&L. We would talk about how many subscribers we had, how it was growing, how many we were acquiring, what it cost to acquire them.", "I mean, walking everybody through the metrics of the business, so...", "ALEX BLUMBERG: And you're doing this in the parking lot?", "PATTY MCCORD: Because we didn't have a room big enough for everybody to be in.", "ALEX BLUMBERG: So every Friday or whatever, you would take the whole - the whole company, which is like, what, 100 people?", "ALEX BLUMBERG: I'm just imagining you all out in the parking lot, like ...", "PATTY MCCORD: We learned later -- we learned later that, at one point Blockbuster sent spies to the -- to the other parking lot that was adjacent to listen in.", "ALEX BLUMBERG: You're like, \"Who are those people in the -- in the blue golf shirts over there?\"", "For Patty, all of it was exciting. It was a fast-growing startup… they were trying to something new. And it’s around here, in the early 2000s, that we get to the point in the story where the official seeds of what would become her masterpiece, the culture deck, get planted.", "So what happened was Netflix was growing fast… but there was a lot of bad stuff happening too.", "PATTY: The growth for, particularly in the DVD-by-mail business, the growth was killing us. It was a terrible dilemma, right?", "Where every time we acquired a new customer, we had to buy three DVDs and stamps and envelopes and pay the labor to send it to them.", "ALEX BLUMBERG: So the more customers you got, the more -- the less money you had. Like, each new customer wasn't adding to your bottom line, it was taking away from your bottom line.", "PATTY MCCORD: Yes, they did -- because it was subscription, they would add to the bottom line over time.", "PATTY MCCORD: But we had -- but because, you know, if the economics of the subscription model means that, once your base is deep enough and wide enough to sustain your growth, then it just keeps feeding the machine.", "PATTY MCCORD: But -- but we hadn't gotten to that baseline economics yet.", "PATTY MCCORD: Right? And we weren't really sure whether or not it would work. And we had a very small window to do it before we ran out of money and/or went public, whichever came first.", "ALEX BLUMBERG: Right. And so you were doing this, and your plan was to go public, and you had been building toward that, but then ...", "PATTY MCCORD: We'd been building towards that. We had been, you know, on the sidelines waiting for our IPO, and then the 2000 and, you know, September 11th happened, the economy went to hell happened, the Bay Area dotcom bubble burst.", "ALEX BLUMBERG: And so you guys were just like, \"Oh, no!\"", "PATTY MCCORD: Oh, no! Oh, no! All our plans may be up in smoke, right?", "It was time for drastic action, which meant layoffs. And as head of HR, that was Patty’s department. She started looking at the staff and figuring out who it was essential to keep, and who they could let go.", "And they had to let go of a lot of people. People who’d been there from the beginning, who’d worked hard, poured their hearts and souls into building the company.", "By the end, she’d cut a third of Netflix’s workforce. It was agonizing and painful.", "But after it was all done, Patty said she and Reed noticed something. They were getting twice as much done, with a third fewer people.", "PATTY MCCORD: Reed and I sat down together and went, \"I'm totally excited about coming to work. How about you?\"", "He's like, \"It's the most fun I've ever had. What is it?\" You know, \"What is it? What -- what -- can we -- can we write down this, what's happening here and see if we can codify this into the way we operate?\"", "ALEX BLUMBERG: So you're -- you're saying that you were -- you -- you had laid off all these employees, and then you and Reed come in and you're realizing, \"Wait.", "I like working here way better, because we're accomplishing more with fewer people.\"", "ALEX BLUMBERG: At that point, when did you start to notice at that point that the company was turning around?", "PATTY MCCORD: Oh, we could see it in the subscriber base.", "ALEX BLUMBERG: So the subscriber base, was just growing.", "PATTY MCCORD: Yeah. The subscriber base was just growing organically and exponentially. And we were making so many improvements in the service very, very rapidly.", "And we had assembled a really incredible team on both ends of the DVD-by-mail business: on the -- the web side and the people working on the personalization algorithms, and that whole software side.", "PATTY MCCORD: And we had a really brilliant team of people sort of reinventing the back-end logistics software to move DVDs through the U.S. Postal Service as efficiently as anybody on the planet.", "So things were really clicking along. And you know we used to listen to the Blockbuster earnings call on a polycom in the conference room, right?", "ALEX BLUMBERG: To listen to the Blockbuster earnings call. Your biggest -- your biggest competitor.", "PATTY MCCORD: Our biggest competitor. Who were 100 times bigger than we were at the very least, right?", "PATTY MCCORD: And some -- one analyst asked John Antioco, who's the CEO of Blockbuster, what do you think of this company Netflix?", "And he says -- he gets mad. And he goes, \"They are nothing. They are a gnat. They are nobody. People go to video stores.", "They'll never ever use this service.\" And I remember we were sitting around a table in a conference room.", "Behind this row of people is a whiteboard that shows our customer growth. And it's -- that line is just up and to the right.", "It's practically straight up. And we looked to each other realized, he doesn't know.", "PATTY MCCORD: And then -- and then, you know, internally that was a very, very difficult time because the employees were like, \"Kill them!", "Deal the death blow!\" And we were like, \"No, we gotta wait them out.\"", "PATTY MCCORD: You know, lay low, make it great, wait 'em out, you know? And that was our company mantra for a number of years.", "And that was a -- that was one of the hardest things there was to do.", "ALEX BLUMBERG: Because killing them would have been like, raise a ton of money and just, like, destroy them.", "PATTY MCCORD: Super Bowl ad. Yeah! Right? Gloat at how good we are and how bad they are. And they would have squashed us like a bug.", "Netflix of course did not get squashed like a bug. Instead, in 2002, it finally went public.", "Which put it back into the category of company that Patty had worked at earlier in her career. A big public company.", "With boards, and auditors, and of course, HR manuals, filled with HR policies.", "PATTY: Now, um, the auditors are showing up and the Sarbanes-Oxley people are showing up, and our -- the board, and everybody's saying, you know, you're going to be grown-ups now, it's time to be grown-ups.", "It's time to have policies just like grown-up companies have. Because at that point, we had sort of gotten rid of everything.", "PATTY MCCORD: And it was when, as our executive team, we started saying, \"Really? Do we really have to tell these adult, brilliant, hard-working people to ask permission to spend money?\"", "PATTY MCCORD: Do we really have to have them clock in and out, when half the time, you know, they work from home or work at night.", "PATTY MCCORD: So back up. Why are these policies in place in the first place? Because employees will screw you if you don't watch out.", "And I said, \"Well, what if I took a different tack that says they won't?\"", "PATTY MCCORD: Right? Most people don't come to work and go, \"Gonna screw my company today. How about you?\"", "PATTY MCCORD: Right? Most people come to work and go, \"I want to accomplish something I'm proud of by the end of the day.\"", "PATTY MCCORD: So if you do that, and then you follow the metrics and follow the money, then you'll find out if somebody misused the company's money or made a bad judgment call.", "PATTY MCCORD: And so rather than following the rules, you now rely on people to have maturity and good judgment.", "It’s a big ask but one that seemed worth making. And Patty and Reed started expanding on this thinking.", "Started asking this question: is it inevitable that now that Netflix is a certain size, we have to adopt the HR practices that we’re sick of?", "And so they started asking hard, foundational questions about what is in fact the role of HR, and whether there’s a different, better way to do it.", "And the asking and answering of those foundational questions, over the next 10 years, grew into the Netflix Culture Deck.", "They started reimagining all sorts of things. Vacation policy, for example. Patty and her team realized, “You know what, we don’t need to babysit employee vacation requests.", "Here’s our policy: we have unlimited vacation. You just have to use it responsibly.", "Same deal with expenses. They would no longer track expenses, and require employees to submit 8.5 x 11 sheets of paper with receipts taped on them in order to get paid back for some company expense.", "Their policy became. Use the company’s money wisely. We trust you.", "Patty and Reed continued down this path. Continued trying to build the HR practice for the company they wanted to work at.", "A company that did more and better work with fewer people. A company that had nimble teams with clear goals in front of them.", "And they soon realized that building that company meant reimagining one more thing. Something they’d come to believe standard HR did very poorly.", "Welcome back to Without Fail and my conversation with Patty McCord, the former chief talent officer at Netflix.", "The Netflix Culture Deck, the thing that Patty was putting together little by little as the company grew, it became famous when Netflix CEO Reed Hastings decided to post it online.", "He didn’t even consult Patty first. He just uploaded it, typos and all, and it became wildly popular.", "Sheryl Sandberg said it “may well be the most important document ever to come out of the Valley.”", "And there’s one section in particular that spoke to me when I read it. It starts on page 45, and it points out a dynamic that felt very familiar: as companies grow, so does their complexity, and as complexity increases, things start to feel chaotic.", "And that creates pressure to start implementing rules and procedures. So... if you’re a company that wants to grow AND wants to avoid chaos… a certain amount of corporate bureaucracy starts to feel inevitable.", "But according to Patty’s culture deck, it’s not. Companies can grow while avoiding both chaos and bureaucracy.", "They can have it all. And they can do it by hiring high-performance people. High performance people, the deck says, can operate without as many rules.", "And having a high-performing company that runs informally… that helps you attract more high-performance people, because that’s the kind of culture they like.", "And you know, that sounds great, right? But there is this one other part of it. Occasionally, as you grow, someone who started out being excellent stops being excellent.", "The person who built the brilliant prototype maybe isn’t the best at running the entire division the prototype grew into.", "And so, you have to be ready to fire people. The culture deck says that, at Netflix, they will fire people for the simple reason that they’re just not excellent enough anymore.", "Or they’re excellent at a thing that the company no longer needs.", "And this is brutal, right? Starting a startup is a foxhole experience. It feels like you're part of a family.", "And Patty knew that. And so, she and Reed, they had to come up with a new metaphor. Netflix, it wasn’t a family.", "It’s a team. A pro team, that hires and develops great players. But also, lets them go when they can no longer perform.", "Teams and families both connote cooperation and community. But unlike families, you can get cut from a team.", "And Patty, she got really good at cutting people from the team. She’s had those conversations...", "PATTY: Oh god I don’t know, I mean it goes so far back…", "ALEX: Like the first, tell me an early one where you were like “Oh my god, I have this conversation and I really don’t want to.", "PATTY MCCORD: I'll take somebody on my team, maybe. You know, somebody who worked really, really hard and sorted their resumes and made nice stacks and passed them out, and didn't really understand the technology of what they were recruiting for or the person that they were talking to.", "And when I hired them, I just need somebody to work hard and be friendly.", "PATTY MCCORD: And now I needed somebody who really needed to understand what this team was trying to build.", "And who didn't roll their eyes and go, \"Oh, God. The engineers are so weird!\" Right? I needed somebody to go, \"You know what?", "I just --\" somebody to spontaneously say to me, \"You know I did today Patty? I sat next to somebody writing code for an hour and I watched them.", "ALEX BLUMBERG: Here, I'm gonna play the role. I'm -- I'm -- I'm that person in the H.R. department that was sorting resumes.", "And you have been sort of like fearing the conversation, but knowing that it has to come.", "ALEX BLUMBERG: And you knock on my door. What do you say to me?", "PATTY MCCORD: I say, \"I think you've gotten kind of the vibe that I'm not particularly happy about the way things are going.\"", "PATTY MCCORD: Because -- oh, yeah yeah. Right. \"But I have not.\" And then I'm like, \"Okay, so I haven't been very clear about that.", "So here's the team that I'm trying to build. And I need to have people that really understand the technical people and understand what they're doing and what their timelines are, and what's important to them.", "ALEX BLUMBERG: But I do, Patty. I do. I -- I -- I've -- like, what -- what gives you the sense that I don't know that?", "PATTY MCCORD: Okay, so when you're in the engineering organization right now that you support, can you tell me what the top three technical issues that are facing them are?", "ALEX BLUMBERG: Ahh something about -- latency periods. I don't know.", "PATTY MCCORD: Okay, so tell me what latency periods are.", "ALEX BLUMBERG: But you never told me that was a problem.", "PATTY MCCORD: Okay, I'm telling you now. And I'm late, right? I need to -- I need to own -- I need to own telling you that I probably should have told you this a fair time ago.", "And we're -- I'm kind of under the gun, because we gotta hire a lot of people to solve this latency problem very quickly.", "So, if I were to start over again with you walking in the door knowing what you know, I'm not sure I'd hire you.", "Patty says that having a conversation like this, as difficult as it sounds, is way better than what she did in her previous career, in traditional HR.", "PATTY MCCORD: Let's use the example we just did. I would put you on a performance improvement plan.", "PATTY MCCORD: A 90-day performance improvement plan. And I don't really think you can do it anyway, right?", "What I really want to do is get rid of you. So every Wednesday morning at 11:00 o'clock I'm going to sit down with you and I'm gonna prove that you're incompetent in writing.", "Now every Tuesday night I'm going to drink a lot. And so are you. And by the third Tuesday night, third Wednesday morning, you're just going to start crying when you walk in the door", "and probably I will too, because it's going to be a really horrible conversation, right? So not only are you and I miserable, because we both know at some point it's a farce.", "PATTY MCCORD: But your bad performance has gone to hell, or you're trying desperately to do something that you don't know how to do.", "PATTY MCCORD: So you have three months of severance already in your pocket. Instead of wasting that three months of time for you, the person and the rest of the team...", "PATTY MCCORD: I can sit down and go, \"I got to make the call. I'm in charge, and I don't think you're going to make it.", "And I am not going to set you up to fail. And I want you to take what you've learned here and find the right job at the right place for you.", "But it's not here, okay? So let's not do this. Let's not spend the next three months doing it. Here's a check for three months' salary.\"", "PATTY MCCORD: No. No, it took me years! It took me years! I was -- I mean, I really was an H.R. professional.", "It was -- but those were like, when I started paying attention to -- I'm the one that was in all those meetings.", "PATTY MCCORD: And I'm thinking, \"Why am I lying to this person? We both know this is a game. It's so cruel.", "ALEX BLUMBERG: Is it? You've now done it both ways. You've had the experience and obviously every firing is ...", "PATTY MCCORD: So much so. So much so. Yeah, but it's -- but it's part of the whole system that I'm describing to you.", "And the bigger system says, \"Hey, you know what? Bunky, I hired you because you're an incredible builder.", "And for the past four years you have built something that will stand the test of time. You should be so proud of yourself.", "You're done. You’re done. We're not going to build another one of those.\" Right? And this new thing that we're building, you actually don't know how to do.", "But there's plenty of companies in the world who could use your expertise. Let's figure out how we do that for you.\"", "Coming up, this conversation that Patty McCord had with so many other people… someone has it with her.", "My guest, HR maverick Patty McCord, had a long run at Netflix, from 1998 until 2012. Her departure came at a pivotal moment for the company.", "Netflix had been through a bruising time where it decided to split the DVD-by-mail part of its company from its streaming business.", "In the process it hiked membership fees by 60 percent, and subscribers revolted.", "Not only that, but House of Cards was on the horizon, and that meant a new future for Netflix. The company was pivoting to become a content creator.", "And Patty… who was really good at hiring engineers… didn’t have the skillset for this new world of entertainment.", "So Reed Hastings, the CEO of Netflix, had a conversation with her.", "PATTY MCCORD: Reed did exactly what I just described to you.", "PATTY MCCORD: Right. Yeah. If I walked in the door tomorrow for the company that I'm building, would I -- would I hire you?", "Maybe. Maybe not. Right? Maybe it's time to draw a new card.", "PATTY MCCORD: Oh yeah. I mean it'd been a rough year. Yeah. So I mean, was -- is anybody completely prepared for that conversation?", "No. Was I as prepared as anybody? Yeah. Was I sad? Of course.", "ALEX BLUMBERG: Did you understand? Did you have the feelings of, like, I want to argue back with him, I want to -- I want to stop this?", "PATTY MCCORD: Of course. I'm human. I mean I remember saying to Reed, I'm like, \"What if I leave and something great happens", "and I won't be here?\" He's like, \"Something great is going to happen. You won't be here.\"", "ALEX BLUMBERG: Uh-huh. Did you know -- did you see yourself from both… the reason that I'm interested in it is this is -- there's two reasons.", "One, you are one of the very few people who has, like -- who was in the position of going through the thing that you had been on the other side of for many, many, many, many times.", "And -- and I'm just curious about, like, that perspective, as, like, somebody who both knows what's going -- knows probably exactly what Reed is going to say.", "But then, you're hearing the words instead of saying them. I'm just curious about, like, what that felt like.", "PATTY MCCORD: You know, what I was surprised by was the profound sadness that I wouldn't be part of it anymore.", "That -- that was the emotion that surprised me. Not any of the other ones: the anger and the crankiness and the fighting back and all that.", "I mean, that's just human nature, right? And we both kind of knew that was going to happen, so we just sort of had to work through that.", "ALEX BLUMBERG: Yeah. Did you think at the time that that was happening that like, \"Oh the -- the -- this -- this -- this culture that I have built is now -- has now… turned on me?", "ALEX BLUMBERG: You're like, \"Why did I ever -- why did I ever write that deck in the first place?\"", "PATTY MCCORD: No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. We -- so -- so we had a ritual, Reed and I going back forever.", "We'd take the company to Sundance and then he and I would get together and we'd have a bottle of wine together.", "Got progressively better by the way, over the years.", "PATTY MCCORD: And the conversation we would have is, you know, am I the right person for what's in front of us next year.", "And we had -- both of us had it. So very, very early on we had this conversation where he said in front of a bunch of people, \"You know, McCord, I could fire you in a hot minute,\" or something like that.", "And I brought him in a room and I said, \"Hey, newsflash. I could quit in a hot minute.\" You know, like, \"I am a professional, you know?", "You know, you're not the only game in town, and did you know it kind of hurts my feelings when you say that?\"", "And he says \"Oh, come on. Really? What hurts your feelings?\" And I'm like, \"It hurts my feelings. Makes me feel bad.\"", "And I'm talking to him -- we're having this conversation in, like, 1999.", "PATTY MCCORD: And I said, \"Really Reed, I can't imagine anything worse than, like, publicly failing.

Under one condition.\" And I'm like, \"Why is it always one condition with you?\"", "And he goes, \"You tell me.

Definitely, academia was a good way to go. Actually, I found myself pretty attracted to university life, in general.", "It was a good way to prolong that, but that’s not the way it played out.", "Brian: So the first few jobs when you came out of university, were they generally in, like, research labs and things like that?", "Neil: Yeah. I managed to overlap those in a fairly unusual way. I got my BSc at the University of Durham, and then I stayed on there to do a PhD.", "And once I finished the coursework, my professor ended up signing me to a summer internship at a lab in Palo Alto called Schlumberger Palo Alto Research.", "And it was very much doing work that was aligned with the computer vision and image processing research that I was doing at…well, had by then become the University of Aberdeen because my professor had moved.", "And so, I got to spend a summer, which turned into five years at Schlumberger, and I did eventually graduate.", "It took a little longer than it should’ve done, but I came out with my PhD eventually in, whenever that was, 1999.", "Neil: I came out eventually. Would’ve graduated in 1989 when Schlumberger dissolved their lab.", "Brian: But when you were at Schlumberger, that’s generally in the what, the mid-’80s, early ’80s?", "Neil: Yeah, 1984 for a bunch of years. That’s right, yeah.", "Neil: Schlumberger, of course, was an oil field services company, so then, in the ’80s, they were getting very deeply into computer and microelectronic stuff", "and so they bought a bunch of companies. And remember, they bought Fairchild. This was actually the Fairchild AI Lab, and, you know, it became a Schlumberger Palo Alto lab about the day before I joined, in fact.", "Brian: And I bring that up because, is it correct that you met Reed Hastings at Schlumberger?", "Neil: That’s correct, yeah. He was there in a different position, but we crossed paths from time to time.", "And that formed a connection that he would come to tap a little later on.", "Brian: Right. So moving forward a bit in time, can you tell me about Pure Software, what it was, and how you got involved in what you did there?", "Neil: Yeah. After the Schlumberger Lab had dissolved, people were spun out to all kinds of different companies, and I went to join [inaudible] Research Lab.", "And I was working on productizing some of my research, making a software tool, and Reed contacted me.", "He had built a prototype of a software checking and validation tool he thought might be useful. And he brought it over and I tried it out, and it was useful.", "It found a bunch of issues and challenges. And shortly afterwards, he invited me to join his new company and productize that offering.", "And then that was Pure Software and the tool was Purify, which was a C and C++ error checking tool.", "Brian: So to be clear, Reed founded Pure and was the CEO?", "Neil: Yes, it’s 1991. And Pure Software quickly became profitable on that [inaudible] tool Purify, and then we added a variety of additional tools.", "The software tool space was going through a phase of consolidation at that point, and so there were a bunch of different mergers.", "Oh, by the way, we became Pure Atria Software, and then we became Rational Software and a big suite of software development tools off of Rational, of which Purify was one, and that was kind of the story there.", "At that point, Reed moved on. I moved, temporarily, to Boston, which probably wasn’t my long-term future.", "And in that intervening year, Reed and a couple of other folk, Mark Randolph and a few folk, started putting Netflix together.", "And in 1998, he approached me about joining Netflix and moving the engineering effort there. And so we came and talked, and ended up…I joined Netflix in early 1999 when it was still a very nascent business and there were lots of things still to be figured out in the future.", "Brian: To the best of your recollection, I know it’s a long time ago, but do you remember what you thought of the idea of Netflix when you first heard about it?", "Neil: It clearly had some big ambitions, but at the time, the goal was to start building a business around shipping DVDs through the mail.", "And DVDs, you remember, were only just introduced, so there was a very small install base of DVD players in the country and the world.", "And shipping by email was an unusual proposition, to be sure, so it was quite a speculative venture.", "Brian: So when you do sign on, what is your job description, or what do you work on first? What do you join the company to do?", "Neil: My job description was VP of Internet Engineering. And the first mission, perhaps, was to solve the year 2000 problem, which was upon us at that time.", "And even though this was a brand new company, we were able to find a bunch of places where two digit year codes would’ve rolled over backwards and caused all kinds of trouble.", "In the end, 11 months later, we didn’t have a year 2000 problem, but it was certainly the very first thing dumped on my plate on day one.", "Brian: So the website, when you got there, had already been launched live to the public?", "Neil: Yes, it had. That’s right. At that point, it was a service offering transactions a la carte, rentals of DVDs for a period of a week or so.", "And we found it pretty difficult to get consumers to come back and have a second try. You know, shipping delay is a pretty serious impediment when you’re taking a day to four days to ship a disc each way.", "And so at that stage, the business was not tremendously successful.", "Brian: Well, right. I think we need to underline that. Everyone thinks of Netflix as this subscription service, but it was an a la carte rental service at the beginning.", "Do you remember what the thinking was that evolved into the subscription plan that people would remember?", "I’d like to lay just a little claim to credit for calling it the “Queue” which, of course, me as a Brit, that’s a very familiar word.", "Neil: Well, even before I joined, we were discussing how we could turn this into a recurring revenue model, which is what subscription is, effectively.", "And it became quickly apparent that we needed to get to that really quickly. We were able to get customers to come try Netflix, but to get them to come back again was difficult.", "And so, the key pieces that we needed to build were a model where people pay for a month of service and then they get to use it a number of times during that month.", "And secondly, the Queue was a super important piece of the puzzle because if you got consumers to build a list of the titles they were interested in, then you could automatically ship the next one when they returned the first one.", "And that was the key to providing a continuity of service and a value that made people engage.", "And so, I’d like to lay just a little claim to credit for calling it the “Queue” which, of course, me as a Brit, that’s a very familiar word.", "To people outside of Britain who are not computer scientists, queue is a pretty strange word, is it the Kway or the QU or what have you?", "Unfortunately, my technical terminology leaked through into the consumer space, which I’ve regretted for years and years, but it is kind of a humor", "Brian: Yeah. I mean, so the queue is obviously this… moving to subscription allows you to do the Queue, it allows you to collect information what people want to watch next and what they’re interested in, but it also gives you the great tagline of “No late fees.”", "Neil: That’s right, exactly, yes. I think I’ve got it the other way around. The Queue allowed us to go to subscription, not the other way around.", "Without a queue, we wouldn’t have had a subscription plan, but with a queue, we are able to eliminate late fees, to always have a DVD sitting on top of your TV ready to go, and you know, the rest was history at that point.", "The business began to grow and accumulate subscribers, and the revenue started [inaudible] looking great.", "We worked on the…I joined in ’99, we started work on subscription pretty quickly. And by the fall of ’99, we were out with the subscription plan.", "Brian: And you also—correct me if I’m wrong—but you also started working really early on things like personalization and algorithms to help recommend movies and things like that, right?", "Neil: That’s correct, yeah. You’ve gotta remember, again, that in 1999, the library of titles on DVD was measured in the dozens, not the thousands.", "But very quickly, it became apparent that giving people a tool to find the next interesting thing to watch was gonna be important for subscriber satisfaction, member satisfaction.", "But also, the habit was for people to come in and search for the newest release, and we would rush to the store and buy a whole lot of copies of the new release, whatever it was.", "“Das Boot” was one of them, was one of the first new releases after I joined, the…", "Neil: Yeah. Which was chiefly distinguished by the fact that they printed the Side 1/Side 2 on the wrong side of the disc, and it really wasn’t clear.", "So you put the thing in, and then the thing started right in the middle of a really intense [inaudible] charging scene with rivets popping off and explosions and…", "Brian: Wait a minute, why do I have a memory of that? Like, did I actually watch that DVD? You literally just rang a bell in my head.", "I feel like that happened to me. Anyway, sorry, go ahead.", "Neil: It probably did. And then about 10 minutes in, you realize, “No, this isn’t the start of the DVD.”", "And you pull it out, and then it’s, “Yeah, okay. Let’s flip it over [inaudible].” Oh, there was so much broken stuff in those days.", "Neil: Yeah. So we needed to figure out a way that we weren’t shipping the newest copies of the newest titles to our members and then having them come back and sit on the shelf and nobody else ever wanted to watch them.", "And so, the idea of recommending stuff that they might not immediately have in mind but which they wanted to see, maybe all the titles, historic titles, was gonna be an important piece to making the business sustainable.", "If we could rent each title 10 or 20 times, it would become a sustainable business. If we were buying a title for $20 and renting it for part of a subscription, it was not gonna float for very long.", "Brian: So let me just underline this again. So the Recommendation engine is obviously something to help users, you know, find movies they might wanna watch, but also on your side of it, it’s a solution to inventory issues and profitability issue?", "Neil: That’s correct, yeah. We called it the “percent new problem,” that if 80% of what we shipped out of the door was a brand new disc, then it clearly was gonna be very expensive to run this business.", "And the recommendations was a way to solve that in a win-win way.", "Brian: So I’m gonna just throw this in here real quick. Just, you know, like we said, you join in ’99, it’s the height of the dot com bubble, 2000, the bubble bursts.", "I know you can only speak for yourself, but you’re only there for about a year, maybe a year and a half, when the bubble bursts.", "You can only speak for yourself, but were you ever concerned that, “Oh, maybe we’re one of these dot com companies that are gonna go under, we’re not gonna make it?”", "Neil: Of course. You know, the world was pretty strange. A little anecdote that probably comes from a few months later, but that’s quite relevant…", "Neil: I feel like Reed and the management of Netflix had always had in mind building a sustainable business from the beginning and so, you know, hence their focus on solving the new disc shipping problem, even though all of our peer companies, at the time, were raising piles of cheap money and using it to fund growth and gaining eyeballs and market share at almost any cost.", "And I remember a board meeting where the board members were puzzled as to why we weren’t spending money faster and growing faster, as opposed to trying to solve the problems of making the thing profitable.", "And within months, that kinda turned on it’s head, and the fact that we had gotten reasonably close to profitability meant that we were able to raise one more round and eke that out.", "It was touch and go, but we were able to get through to profitability and growth, in spite of the fact that the market for internet businesses at that point had slipped to extremely negative.", "Brian: Well, and you were one of the first, or possibly the first internet company, to IPO after the bubble burst.", "Neil: Yeah. As with all of these things, there’s a good measure of luck that. Luck favors the prepared mind, the prepared business, and we were fortunate that we had approached it with kind of a sound business idea in mind.", "Brian: Before we get to what we came here to talk about, the streaming stuff, I wondered if you wanted to say a little bit about the competition with Blockbuster.", "I mean, this is one of those classic, you know, “Harvard Business School Disruption from the Internet” sort of stories.", "Blockbuster ignored you guys for a while, enough time for you to get traction. But once Blockbuster came online—again, from your perspective, speaking for yourself—like, how worried were you about competition from them and competition from Walmart and people like that?", "Neil: Blockbuster was really the third wave of competition. The first wave was Walmart, and the second wave was Amazon.", "So we kind of faced a showdown with the world’s biggest retailer, followed by the world’s biggest e-tailer, and then Blockbuster came in as the world’s biggest video renter.", "But by that time, we had learned, I think, the benefit and virtue of being extremely focused on our customers, on delivering value that they needed and required.", "And I think what we saw, with Walmart, was that they didn’t really have the same level of focus and attention.", "And while it spooked the public markets and the stock price was in the toilet for a while, the actual outcome really was never particularly in doubt.", "We were able to keep growing, and we were able to be successful competing against Walmart. And then Amazon, I think, a little more smartly, decided to compete outside the U.S. and they launched LoveFilm in the UK.", "Brian: Right. They never actually launched in the U.S. a DVD rental service.", "Neil: And then Blockbuster finally woke up that this was a potential threat to their business, and they proceeded to copy our model pretty much exactly and launched that out at a slightly lower price, and we ended up competing on price for a bit.", "They goaded us into— “Goaded” is perhaps the wrong word, they stimulated us into thinking about tiers of service.", "So we would offer a 1-disc, a 2-disc, and a 3-disc plan at different price points so that we could have a low price point compete.", "But at the end of the day, it’s fascinating, we had lots of meetings where we debated all the ways we could respond to the Blockbuster threat.", "And we charted all kinds of new projects in the niche [inaudible] that we were gonna do. And in the end, it amounted to a great deal of running around and not much outcome.", "The thing that really mattered was sticking to the core and delivering a great service and a better performance than Blockbuster was able to do.", "And so, I think the learning that we took away from that was it was more important to focus on our customers and being great at making a great business than worrying about what the competitors are up to.", "And, you know, eventually, as history shows, Blockbuster overextended themselves and went bankrupt. And you know, I think, in that case, it was responding a little too late and then not really being able to put enough effort and focus on it to catch up with the lead and the advantage that we had.", "So it sounds like a bit of a David and a Goliath story, but in the end of the day, I think it’s probably not that uncommon for the incumbent to fail to notice the challenger until it’s too late to effectively respond.", "So this is the story that you see repeated from time to time.", "Brian: Well, you know, it’s probably not that uncommon, but what I would say is uncommon is that…and this is gonna lead us into streaming… is that it’s around 2007 to 2009 that Blockbuster is really vanquished.", "And you guys have proven your model, and you’re on top. At that exact same moment is when you start to move into this new business model.", "So what I would say is rare is, you know, you would expect you guys would maybe rest on your laurels for a bit and say, “We won” and celebrate for a bit, but you’re immediately moving into this new business model.", "Neil: Yes, that’s correct. The interesting challenge here, of course, is it’s a pretty different business that serves the needs of a somewhat different customer base that doesn’t necessarily overlap with the first one.", "And I think we had learned from the Blockbuster experience that focus on your customers, your growth customers, your new customers, is an important thing.", "And so I think we pivoted pretty hard to really fit the attention and focus on the streaming business.", "Yes, initially, it was pretty nascent. We had to piggy back it on top of our DVD rental subscription business because we were unable to put together a library of sufficiently compelling content to be a standalone business.", "Brian: But you know what, you know what? Let’s…hold on. I apologize for cutting in here. Let’s get into streaming with two questions, first of all.", "When the company was conceived… You know, Reed has, several times, given this quote that he didn’t call the company DVD By Mail, he called it Netflix.", "Was the idea always, eventually, to do delivery of video over the internet?", "Neil: Sure. And when you look back at broadband plans and pricing back in ’99, 2000, 2001, that seemed like a pretty out-there suggestion.", "Then as the years went by, it became more and more practical until, by 2007, it was quite feasible. That was about the time that YouTube started out too, doing streaming, consumer-generated, user-generated video…", "Brian: I was gonna say, that was my second question. Was there some moment or catalyst, perhaps YouTube, that was the tipping point that caused you guys to say, “Okay, now is the moment to jump in and try to make streaming happen”?", "Neil: Actually, I would say it was concurrent, but no, we had started working on internet delivery actually a couple of years before, three years I think, before YouTube came on the scene, and it was a bit stop and start.", "And at the time, internet speeds were far too low and video compression was far too poor for a real-time delivery.", "And so we were looking at something much closer to the DVD model of trickle it down overnight and then have it stored on a disc on a box.", "So it became pretty clear that that was not gonna be a very interesting model. I’m not sure whether we were thinking about streaming before YouTube or YouTube helped us to think about that.", "It’s exactly the same time we gave up on the disc storage model and started to think about real-time delivery and streaming to customers as they were watching.", "Brian: And so, you’re thinking of set top boxes? I know, obviously, Roku sort of incubated inside Netflix.", "Were those some of the early projects that you’re talking about?", "Neil: No, it was long before Roku. It was in like, 2003, 2004, we started prototyping a box that… If you remember, TiVo was the hot thing about then, and that was a TV receiver with a disc drive.", "And we were working with some contract manufacturers who were building similar boxes, you know, with a video processor and a hard disc, and we were cobbling together some software to be able to work with a thing like that because that was clearly how we start in the wrong direction that doesn’t go anywhere.", "And then, in the height of competition with Blockbuster, we cancelled all of those projects in favor of just winning.", "And then when Blockbuster finally diminished as an existential threat, we were able to get back. And at that point, it was like, “Okay, well, we’ll skip those things, go straight to streaming.”", "Brian: Okay, so this is around…in 2007, I know, is when the first, I think, streaming products come to market.", "So when do you think that you start working on it in earnest?", "Neil: Oh, it was probably 2006, something like that, we kinda had a model and…", "Brian: There were so many other streaming experiments around that time, like MovieBeam, Movielink, you know, Unbox or something, I can’t even…there was dozens of ’em.", "And iTunes Video Rental starts to come out around the same time. So what is it that makes you guys wanna go into this crowded field that, seemingly, no one had had success with before?", "Neil: I don’t recall it being as crowded as you are painting now. It feels to me like a lot of those things were a bit later.", "There was the ill-fated Enron project to “stream across fiber networks that they would own and deploy”, which, in retrospect, seems awfully quaint.", "Of course, we all know what happened to Enron. But that was maybe the thing that I recall was being most present in our minds as we thought about streaming.", "Like, “What is this thing, and how can this possibly work? And the economics are just gonna be completely crazy.”", "Yeah, anyway. That was a novelty. As far as streaming was concerned, YouTube demonstrated the feasibility of the technology, and there wasn’t a lot that was… When iTunes came along, you’ll remember that it was a download model, it was not a streaming model.", "Neil: And for the first several years, you pressed a button and you waited several hours while the thing trickled down to your disc on your laptop or your device.", "Brian: You know what, you’re right because I’m thinking…", "Brian: I’m thinking of the Apple TV model, not the original iTunes model. You’re right about that.", "Neil: Yeah. Even the Apple TV model, when the Apple TV first came out, that was a… I think I’m right.", "It had a disc in it, you pressed a button and you waited and it might take 20 minutes to buffer enough to be able to start watching.", "Brian: Okay, so that’s a perfect entree into, what are the issues that you guys are having to deal with, you know, ranging from things like bandwidth, the technical issues of like audiovisual quality and things like that?", "So, in around 2006, you said, 2007, you’ve decided that you wanna do a streaming product. What are the roadblocks and what are the problems that you guys have to solve?", "Neil: Well, the good news is that there are a bunch of off-the-shelf pieces that we can assemble to make this feel more real.", "We were able to go to Windows Media Player, and that was a Windows app that played media from your machine.", "And we wrapped that in a…in a wrapper that basically managed the streaming, dynamically assembled a video file on your disc, and then Windows Media Player added to play the content.", "Windows Media Player also had Windows Media DRM that enabled us to satisfy studio requirements that this not be a vehicle for piracy, for a source of stolen copies, that we would protect the content that went out.", "And so were able to piggy back on top of that, and then we were able to leverage ACMI[SP] as a CBM. I think the key insight that we’ve had was that we chose to use HTTP to deliver a file, rather than to use RTP or one of these other streaming protocols.", "And we stayed away from all of the stuff that was being developed at the time in terms of smart streaming protocol, smart streaming engines, where the server was an integral part of delivering the content and where user firewalls and user networks had to be properly configured to listen to a new protocol.", "By sticking with HTTP, we were leveraging the basic capabilities that deliver a webpage in a way that would seamlessly work almost everywhere.", "So we put together those pieces, and I would say the technology that we built, there was a lot of tape and veiling wire and that was pretty tricky, but it was good enough to say, “This is an interesting possibility.”", "The flip side of this is that the content team was trying to assemble a library of content to stream, and that was extremely difficult because of the way video licensing works.", "That essentially, we’re competing with terrestrial broadcasters to acquire the rights to a title, and that can be pretty expensive, especially for a small business with just a handful of customers.", "And so, it was very difficult to get compelling content, certainly nothing that was new or current, it was all extreme, long-tail, deep catalog stuff at the time.", "And it was a good supplement to the DVD rental business. We would be able to provide people with something to watch if they happen to run out of DVDs at home, and they could at least click and watch.", "They could browse catalogs, pick something interesting, say, “That’s what I wanna see,” click the button, and have it start playing within a few seconds, and go through it.", "So it was a great technology demo with a great introduction to some of the challenges of building a content library, but it got us off the ground.", "Brian: Right. So that first product is, you know, on your computer desktop. How soon into that do you start to go out to other platforms?", "I think it was LG, maybe I’m wrong about that, was maybe the first consumer electronics partnership, but then, you know, things like Xbox, PS3, things like that.", "So do you start working on that right away because you realize, you know, only so many people are gonna watch on their desktop?", "Neil: The chronology here is that, almost as soon as we had launched we went into hardware, and we started to build the thing that became the Roku platform, the Roku box, way back in 2007, and put a lot of effort into that.", "Part-way through, I think, most of the way through that development effort, we also engaged with the Microsoft Xbox team, and we started working on an app for the Xbox 360.", "In the end, I think the… If I have it right, I think the Roku box was first out and it ended up being Roku, the standalone company, rather than the box from Netflix.", "And the reason for that is that we realized that we were going to want to work with all of the CE manufacturers and other partners.", "The Xbox project had demonstrated the appeal. And so, we thought it would be a lot easier if we didn’t have our own competing hardware solution in-house.", "And so, by selling up Roku as a standalone entity and freeing him up to go through competing streaming opportunities, we paved the path for working with Xbox, working with Sony PlayStation, and as you say, working with LG and Samsung.", "Brian: So that’s interesting. I just wanna underline that again. The reason you spin off Roku is because then you can be sort of a neutral partner to all of these other hardware manufacturers.", "“We’re not doing hardware in-house. We’re just giving you this platform, and you can put it on your hardware.”", "Brian: What’s the big break… Maybe that’s not what I wanna ask, but was Xbox and things like that, those were the first big breakthroughs, even before we get into the era of all these smart TVs that start coming out?", "Neil: Oh, for sure. Smart TVs were still way down the road. So we did the Xbox thing. It was an interesting quirk that…there were a bunch of things about the Xbox deal that were a little difficult.", "One of them was an exclusivity piece. And so, we did start working with Sony for their PlayStation platform, but Microsoft had a year of complete exclusivity, and so we didn’t get Sony until a year later.", "And then, the next year, they had an exclusivity on a game console app, and so we actually…we built a BD-Java application on a Blu-ray disc.", "Your listeners may not remember them, but Blu-rays had just about replaced DVDs by kind of the late 2000s.", "And the content protection scheme was based on actually having a full-out Java implementation that was able to execute Java code on the Blu-ray disc.", "And, in fact, it was that BD-Java that was the authoring environment for all of the menuing and setup and control for Blu-ray discs.", "And we actually, in an amazing effort, we were able to build a complete streaming player using the BD-Java and delivering it on a disc to Sony PlayStation.", "And so, for the second year, we actually had PlayStation streaming, but not from a [inaudible], but from a piece of code delivered on a plastic disc, which is an interesting irony.", "Brian: I think I remember that too, actually. What was…?", "Neil: Along the way, we took the software platform that we had developed before Roku was spun out, and we generalized that into an SEK[SP].", "I should put an asterisk on that, that generalization took years and is still ongoing at some level. But we were able to take that and deliver it to LG and Samsung.", "But not for smart TVs, it was for Blu-ray players at the time. Smart TVs were still a couple of years in the future, and Blu-ray players had…a process of it was fast enough to do streaming.", "And so, it was a credible place to go build a streaming app, and that’s what we did.", "Neil: Another thing you have to remember here is that the capabilities of the early Roku box and of the LG and Samsung players were somewhat limited.", "And so we didn’t actually build a…what I would call a “discovery and selection UI.” We leveraged the queue concept that all of our DVD members were familiar with, and we allowed you to build a list of the titles you might be interested in.", "And then the UI on the LG Blu-ray player or the Samsung Blu-ray player just basically showed one long list of titles, which were things that you had added to your streaming queue, streaming list.", "And so, it was a very, very simple-done user interface, but it was enough to get going and begin to make things happen.", "And it wasn’t until a couple of years later that we started to add a real choosing and selection…discovery and selection UI on top of that.", "Brian: And then that’s probably when you were into the smart TV era and things like that?", "There was a lot of skepticism at the time that the Wi-Fi would actually work for streaming, and it often didn’t.", "Neil: That’s right. And, you know, I’ll just say, we grew beyond LG and Samsung and pretty most of manufacturers of Blu-ray disc players, and then… The disc player and the TV are actually not that different when you dig inside.", "It’s a pretty similar chip inside. And soon as TVs started to add networking in meaningful numbers..and we pushed hard to have them add Wi-Fi.", "There was a lot of skepticism at the time that the Wi-Fi would actually work for streaming, and it often didn’t.", "It’s hard to imagine today, where Wi-Fi is super robust and generally works pretty well. But early Blu-ray players and smart TVs typically had a wired connection and no Wi-Fi, and you had to run a wire out to your TV, which was an unusual thing, for sure.", "But yeah, we got past that and eventually got good Wi-Fi in these boxes and made it work well.", "Brian: Well, I want to point out for the listeners an interesting parallel here, which I’m sure you’re aware of, but back in the DVD-by-mail days, Netflix grew by…", "As DVD is a technology that’s being adopted and people are buying DVD players for the first time, one strategy that Netflix used heavily was you get a new DVD player, inside the box comes these coupons to try out Netflix.", "So it’s almost serendipitous that, again, as this universe of devices starts to come out, as these smart TVs start to come out, you sort of pursue the same strategy of, “You’ve got this new $3,000 smart TV.", "What are you gonna do with it? Well, look, Netflix is there.”", "Neil: That’s right. You’ve kinda rewound the clock by a bunch of years. In fact, it was an innovation from the very earliest attempts to market the DVD service in early 2000, 2001, that we came up with the idea of… I shouldn’t say we, I wasn’t anything to do with marketing at that point.", "This was Leslie Kilgore and her predecessor, and they came up with the idea of, red tickets in the box were good for three or five DVD rentals.", "And then we had the painful problem, when we introduced streaming, of converting that into, you know, “It says three rentals.", "It actually means a month of free service”. And it was a little bit of hand waving for you to tell there’s a slight difference in the service we were trying to do, but it was obviously a better deal for consumers.", "And then, eventually, yes, that became end [SP] streaming, and the red ticket morphed into other things.", "And in many ways, we continue that same partner marketing plan of including some periods of free subscription in with the purchase of new devices, and that’s been a hugely effective vehicle.", "Brian: You know what, it occurs to me we do need to back up for a second. When you first launched streaming, what is the uptake, like, that you noticed?", "Like, how quickly do you see existing Netflix users using streaming?", "Neil: That’s a great question. I don’t have numbers at my fingertips, but it was pretty slow at first.", "This was a fringe activity that was relevant to eager consumers, early adopters, who had superior home networking and who had the technical savvy to be able to, you know, download our app or to go buy a Roku box or find a high-end DVD player which happened to have an app on it.", "And these are the things that took off slowly. And, you know, the content was not strong at first, it took a while to start building a strong content library.", "Brian: So the content library needs to catch up, the actual installed base of devices that can do the streaming needs to catch up, so it’s not an overnight thing.", "Neil: That’s right. And there was a lot of hard work that Reed and others went through in sort of selling the story on both sides.", "You know, to the hardware manufacturers, “This is gonna be huge, and you should work with us because it’s gonna be a really big piece.”", "And to the content owners that, “You should sell us content because we’re gonna be able to deliver it effectively.”", "And, you know, [inaudible] when we started, and so there was a lot of building the credibility on both sides of the business to make it go.", "Brian: Let’s go back to, also, some of the technical details. You know, famously, you guys start using AWS very early on.", "Just some of the… Once it does start to take off…we’ll fast forward to that. So once it starts to become a thing that, you know, a certain percentage of users are using and then it’s so popular it takes over a certain percentage of all internet traffic… So just the scaleability issues, the bandwidth issues, any of those things that you wanna go into or stories you wanna tell about that.", "Neil: Well, there was an interesting moment in the summer of, I think, 2008 when it was still primarily a DVD business, and the distinction in that is because, as a DVD business, the value delivered to consumers is through the DVDs they have at home.", "And if the website is not up, well, they can come back tomorrow and order a new disc for the next day, and it’s not an egregious failure.", "But at that point, streaming was beginning to become interesting, and we knew it was gonna be the future.", "Amazon had just launched AWS at the time and so we concluded, after a lot of discussion, that if we’re gonna rebuild for redundancy and failover, we should do it in the newest architecture that’s available and not try to build on our legacy stuff.", "At that point, we had a database hardware failure that corrupted the main database that we ran on, and it was an ugly mess.", "It took most of the day to get the consumer-facing website back live again, and it took several days to get our logistics system back up and going again.", "And I’d say a lot of people tore out a lot of hair and lost a lot of sleep during those three days. And it became very clear that, as a streaming business, that kind of downtime was not acceptable, that we needed to have a much higher availability, and that we were gonna need to re-architect our systems to have redundancy and failover and all of the things that are necessary for that kind of improved uptime.", "And we could look at building a duplicate data center and putting the Oracle and Java stuff in it, that we had at that point, or we could look to something completely different.", "Amazon had just launched AWS at the time and so we concluded, after a lot of discussion, that if we’re gonna rebuild for redundancy and failover, we should do it in the newest architecture that’s available and not try to build on our legacy stuff.", "And so, we chose to start from scratch and move our systems over to AWS piece by piece starting in 2008.", "And that was an odyssey that ended taking us about eight years…four years for the majority of it and eight years to clean up the last pieces and unplug our data center.", "And, yeah, lots of interesting stories along the way. The key one is that we recognized immediately that to do a fork of our legacy system into AWS was not gonna get us what we wanted, we needed to re-architect with the structure of AWS in mind.", "And we needed to switch to things like NoSQL databases, instead of trying to use bigger and bigger Oracle installations.", "And we needed to switch to a micro services architecture, instead of a sort of monolithic client server architecture attached to the Oracle database.", "And, in order to do that, we wondered about, “Do we try to build a selection of the complete service top to bottom and then bring that off in AWS?", "We can parallel with the current stuff and then shift customers over, a few at a time? Or instead, do we try to take this feature by feature and implement portions of our system in AWS, while leaving portions left back in the legacy architecture?”", "And it was that latter approach that we chose and I think it was the right decision. I think it got us a lot more experience with how to work with AWS and how to use the services, while deferring, kind of finishing up everything in order to get anything going at all.", "One of the implications, though, is that we spent months building scaffolding that was to real-time replication of our Oracle database in our legacy data center to the databases to the databases we were trying to use inside AWS that would copy data backward and forward in various different ways.", "We called this phase the “Phase of Roman Rising.” Certainly, we had a lot of challenges and frustrations with keeping that scaffolding robust and stable.", "But in the end, it enabled us to move page by page and feature by feature from the legacy data center into AWS and gradually build and gain confidence with, “This is the right way to go” and then move faster and faster until it was all done.", "So it’s a…a critical moment there right after…actually, it was right before the iPhone 3 launched. iPhone 3, you’ll recall, was the first iPhone that had third-party apps available.", "And Apple had instructed[SP] us to build a streaming app for the iPhone 3, and in true Apple form, they had only given us about a month’s notice of what they wanted us to do.", "And so, we rushed to build the iPhone app. The app was actually pretty easy, but what would it talk to?", "We needed to build capabilities to serve user interface and the streaming content to the iPhone. And we debated extensively for a couple of days, and then we decided that, really, the only way forward here was to build this in AWS.", "We didn’t have time to build a backup first in our old legacy data center, and so were faced with a big launch of the Apple WWDC, predicated on our new AWS architecture working well.", "And it was certainly a bit of a nail biting moment for us, but it was a success and it gave us great confidence that AWS was the right way forward.", "And from then on, everything new we built was AWS only.", "Brian: That was actually gonna be one of my questions because here you guys are originally trying to build for set top devices, for TVs, and things like that.", "So did the whole mobile viewing and, you know, the app economy, did that all kind of take you by surprise a bit?", "Neil: I think it was pretty clear that these are gonna be good devices, but certainly the idea that the iPhone was gonna have third-party apps on it was… well, [inaudible] wasn’t obvious until it was, you know, kind of made public.", "Neil: I’m trying to remember the timing here. There was a tablet, too, and I think maybe it was the tablet that was… You know, the first iPad was the first device that we got onto, and then the iPhone followed a few months later.", "Brian: I mean, because…was it even obvious to you guys that people would want to stream over a tiny screen, the handheld screen?", "Neil: It still might not be obvious! There’s some differences in behavior in how people use the small screen versus the big screen.", "Neil: Oh, if you’re watching on a TV, you tend to ignore the phone. If you’re watching on the phone, the phone call comes in, you get interrupted, and so, you know, we end up with shorter viewing sessions.", "I think that somewhat influences the kind of content, just content that people watch on phones it’s content that’s easy to stop and start.", "And then, nowadays, of course, we’ve…you know, fast forward many years into the future, we’ve implemented downloading on phones.", "And so, you know, people are now taking it with them on planes and on trains and on long commutes and in parts of the world where there isn’t a, you know, stable home connection sometimes.", "So, you know, certainly, the world and the environment has changed a bunch and the phone is a nice complement to a smart TV, it’s a way to watch content.", "Brian: One more technical question and then we’ll try to bring it into the present day a bit. You guys, I feel like, have always been like really at the forefront of pushing…so you got streaming to work in a big way.", "You were the first ones to really, you know, crack that nut, but you were always pushing like audiovisual standards as well, like, you know, pushing HD and then moving into 4K.", "And so, was that always a goal as well, where it’s not just enough to get people movies on demand, we have to get them movies that are as high-quality as they could get from any piece of content?", "Neil: I would say it was, in many ways, a reaction to YouTube being seen as lower quality video.", "Neil: I think that we… We worried about being tarred with the same brush that, you know, Netflix streaming is an inferior brush.", "So we wanted to get out in front and say, “No, we can deliver the best quality AV. We can beat DVDs. We can beat Blu-ray.", "We can be first to market with 4K. We can be a leader with high dynamic range.” The big advantage of delivering over the internet is that you don’t have to upgrade an entire infrastructure in order to be able to deliver a new format.", "And so, we’ve been able to be pushing the lead in a lot of these things. And it’s been kinda fun working with…now, of course, we’re into original content…so working with the big-name producers and directors to put this together in the highest-quality formats available.", "Brian: Well, before we get to the original content era, I have to ask about Quickster. We don’t have to spend an hour on it or even two minutes, but just whatever you wanna say about the thinking going into that, but maybe more importantly, the lesson that you guys learned from that experience.", "Neil: Yeah, that’s a great question. In the Blockbuster fight, we had learned the importance of focusing on new customers and the future.", "At at that point, we were a business that was delivering DVDs and streaming on the same subscription, and we were charging $8 for the DVDs and $10 for the combined plan.", "And we were spending probably comparable amounts of money licensing streaming content as we were buying DVDs.", "And so, clearly, an $8 plus $2 didn’t work, we needed to start to collect revenue for the streaming plan that was commensurate with the quality of the content that was available, but by this time was much much better.", "And so, we needed to separate it into two plans and let people choose either DVD or streaming or both and charge a real amount of money for the streaming.", "We were so eager not to make the mistake that most businesses do of ignoring the new business in favor of the legacy business that we were a bit too bold and a bit too eager to make the switch over, and so we kind of spinned into it.", "And we certainly…at this point, [inaudible] bunch of customers with some heavy-handed pricing stuff where we could’ve done somewhat better, I think, by looking to the future customer and being a bit more generous with the pre-existing customer, the customer who got us where we were going.", "But in the end, I look at the Quickster episode, not as a disaster that we not only avoided, but as a critical business transition, a discontinuity that we needed to go through that was gonna be painful, no matter how we did it.", "We didn’t do it perfectly, but we survived and we did accomplish the mission of ending up with a team that was dedicated and focused on streaming and so was able to grow the streaming business.", "And today, dvd.com is a separate division in a separate building. They’re focused on the DVD customers, doing very nicely, and the streaming business is focused on the streaming customers.", "And because they’re different and non-overlapping, minimally overlapping, I should say, we’re able to build the features and capabilities relevant for each side and it’s successful.", "I think, had we not gone through some of the pain of the Quickster period that we might not even be here today at all.", "Brian: So maybe you, you know, modern business theory says you should disrupt yourself, but maybe you guys just did it a little too aggressively.", "I think the piece that many people miss [about Qwikster] is that it was a transition that needed to happen.", "Neil: Yeah, that’s a pretty fair assessment. We were certainly intent on disrupting ourselves, and we did it rather nicely.", "We could’ve been more sophisticated about it, but I think the piece that many people miss is that it was a transition that needed to happen.", "If we hadn’t have done it or if we’d been to timid about it, you know, we probably wouldn’t be where we are today.", "Brian: So again, to bring us into the modern-day era, in the DVD rental era by mail, you buy the physical discs and you can rent them out time and again to people.", "But into the streaming era, it’s a completely different ballgame, you have to acquire the rights to stream content.", "And so early on, because everyone thinks that this is an experiment, maybe even you guys think it’s an experiment, it’s not super expensive to get these rights.", "But then, as the streaming takes off and, as we talked about with the Quickster, you’re seeing this is the business going forward, that becomes more expensive, and then that’s the reason why you realize you need to go into creating your own content right?", "Neil: Yeah. I’m gonna have to put a big caveat on this, that my role as the technology guy, Chief Product Officer, by this point, the technology really had relatively little to do with the content.", "Neil: Ted Sarandos is the architect of the content stuff, so he’s the guy who you should probably do a follow-up episode with and…at some point in the future.", "Brian: Well, obviously, we’d love to, but you know what, let me tee it up, though. I actually was doing that to tee it up to a technical question, which is that, you know, we talked… Early on you were coming up with recommendations and things like that and you guys used personalization and data very early on to help the business.", "But from the technical standpoint, once you get into streaming, you have loads more data about what people are actually watching, about what they’re actually interested in.", "So maybe talk about that, about how once you’re you in the streaming era, like, what you can learn about user behavior potentially transforms what Netflix can do.", "Neil: Yeah, that’s a great point. The recommendation stuff we started out with in 1999 and through the DVD era was…it was important, but it was kind of the sweetener on top of the system.", "We didn’t have great feedback as to what people had watched and enjoyed. We knew what we’d sent them, we had hard data on which discs we’d sent, but we didn’t know which discs they’d actually watched and which ones they’d enjoyed.", "And so, right from 1999, 2000, we built the star bar, the five-star thing that’s become such a popular internet meme, because we needed to collect data, “This is a terrible movie” “This is a wonderful movie” and “This is an okay movie” to be able to feed back.", "And we collected a lot of that. I think we probably collected 5 million ratings a day, but still relatively small, compared to the shipping volume.", "And if people didn’t give us ratings, then it was very hard to predict accurately for them.", "But with streaming, you actually have much better data. You see which titles people really engage with and which ones they watched a few minutes of and then turned off again.", "And so, that quality enjoyment data is actually probably better than the star data. The star data tends to be viewed as, “Well, this is a high-quality movie, whether or not I enjoyed it,” you know.", "So maybe it rates production value and sort of perceived value of the story rather than enjoyment value…", "Brian: Like, you might give, say, I don’t know, “King’s Speech” five stars because you know it won Best Picture, but maybe you didn’t really like it", "and maybe you didn’t even finish it. But now, with streaming, you can see, “Oh, they would tell us it’s five stars, but they stopped after 1:20.”", "Neil: Exactly. And the two examples from the era that I like to use for that, you know, “Schindler’s List” and “Hotel Rwanda,” both really good movies, but not necessarily what you wanna watch tonight.", "You know, really dark, deep, provocative, thought-provoking things, but you know, “Tonight, I just want something that I can lean back to and enjoy.”", "And so yeah, the streaming feeling data sort of gives us that enjoyment factor, which is much more valuable, and it gives us complete coverage too.", "And so, we’re able to use that pretty effectively to drive suggestions and recommendations.", "more than 80% of everything that people watch on Netflix is influenced, to some degree, by the personal information that we’ve brought to bear.", "The search feature on our system drives a small amount of viewing, it’s in the teens percent, I think.", "And search itself has a little bit of recommendations and suggestions built in. It’s designed to [inaudible] you, if you’ve got a small number of titles presented, then we know, roughly, what you might be aiming for.", "But everything that’s not search has a strong component of personalization and predicted enjoyment built in.", "And so, it’s true to say that more than 80% of everything that people watch on Netflix is influenced, to some degree, by the personal information that we’ve brought to bear.", "And that delivers a lot of value for our members and a lot of value for us, in terms of making Netflix just the key place, the place that people come back to every night.", "Brian: Well, and also helps you figure out, now that you are producing your own content, what would be the content to produce that your users would actually want to view.", "Neil: Sure, but there’s an assumption there that I wanna challenge. We don’t write stories by data. Stories have to be organic and intact, and so we trust a producer or a team to craft an interesting story.", "But we are able to take the outlines, the pitch, the casting choices, the various decisions that go around that and plug that in to get an idea of who’s gonna be interested, which helps us to know if this is an economically feasible project.", "And so, using the data to make funding decisions is a different game than using the data to tune the story, which we don’t do.", "Brian: One more question and then I’ll let you go. You’ve been so generous with your time. I saw you give a talk where you discussed how, not only are you…you know, everything’s in the cloud, you’re delivering content streaming.", "But as part of the production process, as you’re producing content, you’re also using some of this cloud technology and these cloud services to help streamline production as well?", "Neil: Yeah. You know, there’s an aside that I have to make here [inaudible] an introduction. Everything’s in the cloud except our CDN.", "OpenConnect is another important piece of the story that we haven’t talked about at all.", "Brian: And we should say, CDN is Content Delivery Network. Sorry, go ahead.", "Neil: That’s correct. So to make streaming work effectively, you don’t want to be streaming… Particularly, we’re streaming to 192 and a half countries around the world, the half is Ukraine without Crimea.", "You gotta get the content close to the subscriber, you don’t want it [inaudible 01:05:35] on the fiber optic pipes under the ocean.", "You know, the kinds of volumes we do that doesn’t work. And so, we have content servers all over the world in thousands of locations, in many cases, actually installed into ISP’s infrastructure and they write it…they", "[inaudible] in their system so that there’s a minimum amount of “internet structural backbone” that’s the first [inaudible].", "And we put a lot of effort into building very small, very power-efficient, exceedingly effective delivery devices that can stream, you know, most of 100 Gigabytes a second out of a relatively small footprint.", "And the stack of the listings installed in an IX or an ISP’s infrastructure is really key to delivery, and that’s been an important piece of building to the scale we’ve got today.", "So I certainly wanna mention the team that’s been working hard on that because that’s an important piece of the story.", "If you’ll remind me your real question, I think just close out on the right topic…", "Brian: That I saw you mention that you’re using things like the cloud and things like that on the production side, so that it’s easier for your actual, you know, original productions to do things more efficiently.", "Neil: Got it, right. So yes, we are producing this year 400 original titles for, I think, 1,000-plus hours of content, and that makes us one of the bigger production studios in the world.", "And, of course, there’s lots of opportunity for IT to support an operation like making a series or making a movie, all the way from the planning stages, where we’re receiving pitches and scripts and we’re soliciting opinions and getting feedback, and where we’re making decisions and working through legal contracts and planning and scheduling and booking casts and sets and renting equipment and delivering it to the locations.", "All of this stuff is an opportunity for IT to make it more efficient, more effective. And then, into the production phase, where we wanna be able to capture the daily shoots, bring them home so people maybe in another country be able to see the daily takes and see what’s going on, through to the editing.", "We subtitle in 20-something languages, 23 or 25, I think. We [inaudible 01:08:38] languages, and so the localization and the post-production work.", "So all this process in an area where, rather than acquire or license the conventional tooling to do this stuff, it’s an area where we’ve chosen to invest in building cloud-based technology.", "And the vision that I’ve tried to bring to life here, and so still a few years from being anything like tangible yet, is that there’s kind of a dashboard of a production that a director or a producer can carry around on their mobile device.", "And they can see yesterday’s tapes and today’s scripts and the planning for tomorrow, and they can make sure that everything’s lined up, and they can look to see what did they do last year in the previous season", "and then what’s going on on this other side. And, you know, it’s the dashboard that brings the data from all the phases of the current production and all the acquired knowledge from all the other productions that we’ve done in a way that provides us with…that will provide us, when it’s fully realized, an amazing tool for efficient production of original content.", "And so, I think that’s a really exciting possibility that we’re investing in heavily at the moment.", "Brian: Well, Neil, I believe you are leaving Netflix in July, is it?", "Brian: So my last question is really simple, and if it’s too personal, you can be vague. But what are your plans for life post-Netflix?", "Neil: I’ve been continuously employed since I was 16 or 17 years old, and I’m gonna take a bunch of months, maybe a year or two, to just go through the things that appeal.", "Travel, I’m a big outdoors person, I love to bike and kayak and climb mountains. And I’m gonna be doing all of those things here in my home in California and around the world, and that’s gonna be fun.", "I’m expecting, though, that at some point, I’ll wanna get back into building something. And I find, at this point, there are sort of three areas that are particularly appealing to me, the area of precision medicine, so", "healthcare augmented by technology and big data and machine learning. The area of education, I think that learning is going through a big transformation, and we need to make it much more effective and affordable and available.", "And then alternative energy, I feel like the opportunity to apply technology to solving some of the climate crisis problems is a good one too.", "So those three areas are particularly appealing to me. I don’t know if I’ll find something that’s compelling and where I can make a difference, but that’s something I’d like to imagine is in my future.", "Brian: Yeah, well, good luck if you do one or maybe all three of those things. But Neil Hunt, thank you so much for coming on the show, giving us just a wonderful background history of Netflix, of the streaming product.", "But also, thank you for sharing a really, really fascinating career.", "Neil: Well, thank you for the opportunity. And I would be remiss if I didn’t note that there’s about 2,000 people here now at Netflix and [inaudible 00:12:33] who’ve worked with me and around me and on my team and on my care teams over the past 18 years that I’ve been at Netflix.", "And it’s been an extraordinary experience, and I really I’m very fortunate to have worked with so many smart and sharp people.", "And that’s been great, so I thank them all as well. You know who you all are, if you’re listening to this.", "[…] Netflix’s response to these problems was reflective of how the management was focused on building a sustainable business model, as opposed to growing up too fast.", "Instead of focusing on building a huge content library the company instead optimized their DVD-on-mail solution for their existing library.", "This business decision was what helped the company survive the crash that followed the dot com bubble.", "[…] Fascinating InternetHistory podcast examining the history of Netflix provided by Chief Product Officer Neil Hunt who interestingly is stepping down in July after 18 years at the company during which he oversaw their move into SVOD powered by AWS: […]"]}

Instead, I found myself frustrated and unable to continue ignoring the issues that have plagued Netflix’s true crime originals for a while now.", "In short, these documentaries are severely lacking on a few fronts. It appears that Netflix isn’t trying when it comes to this genre anymore and, ultimately, it breaks down to the following issues: presentation, storytelling, and ethics.", "If you watch enough Netflix true crime documentaries, you’ll notice that after Making a Murderer, Netflix started to adhere to a particular aesthetic.", "You know the one I mean — where everything takes on a hint of grey to reinforce the blatantly grim topic and lend some authenticity to the often skewed and biased perspectives.", "While cinematography’s not the only way to engage an audience, it certainly adds to your viewing pleasure.", "This is likely rooted in the belief that if it worked for one show, it should work for the rest, because producers love nothing if not a proven formula for success.", "I’m sure having everything shot and graded the same way saves production and post-production costs, too, but it certainly doesn’t make exciting viewing for your audience.", "For example, Unsolved Mysteries clearly has a budget and there’s a degree of refinement to the series.", "But, despite the high quality of production, the grading feels flat and drained of colour, to the point where the overall cinematography takes on a monochromatic look.", "Having seen the same look in Netflix’s documentaries The Killer Inside: The Mind of Aaron Hernandez (2020), The Disappearance of Madeleine McCann (2019), and Making a Murderer, it’s become overly familiar to me.", "The only reason Tiger King: Murder, Mayhem and Madness (2020) looked as colourful as it did was due to the people it documented: it’s hard to look dull with that much animal print and the essence of Florida itself on-screen.", "There’s also the issue of too much filler.

What leads could resolve this case?", "This is perhaps the biggest flaw of Unsolved Mysteries: the filmmakers don’t appear to care about presenting a clear, well-researched case.", "Not only is this poor investigating, but it’s also irresponsible filmmaking. These cases matter because they’re the narrative of real people’s lives, not stories made up for the sake of entertainment.", "The audience is watching witnesses and survivors of harrowing crimes and they themselves are seeking answers.", "By comparison, the original Unsolved Mysteries functioned much in the way that the British programme Crimewatch (1984–2017) did, reconstructing crimes to raise raising public awareness and hopefully bringing new information and witnesses in.", "It was remarkably successful in achieving its goal and it is estimated that over 260 cases were solved during the show’s original run.", "The new Unsolved Mysteries clearly wishes to do the same with its website imploring visitors to “help solve a mystery”.", "However, if it wants to make a difference, it must change its format to actually take a productive step toward a positive impact.", "It owes its participants at least that much for re-living such traumatic events on camera.", "Netflix has shown that it’s capable of producing well-researched documentaries that tackle complex subjects.", "Killer Inside: The Mind of Aaron Hernandez was a great example, covering a lot of information in the space of three episodes.", "It acknowledged a variety of important issues in American football that contributed to player Aaron Hernandez’s crimes, such as homophobia, drug use, toxic masculinity, and chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE).", "The documentary paid attention to the details, providing a comprehensive insight into the mind of Aaron Hernandez, living up to its name and setting a precedent for what Netflix could be.", "While we’re on the subject of fact-checking, Netflix has a bad reputation for presenting facts in a dishonest fashion.", "Two of their most popular series make this obvious; Making a Murderer and The Staircase (2004–2018). Making a Murderer was a blueprint for what Netflix’s true crime output has become.", "It drew in viewers not usually interested in true crime and took them on a journey through a fascinating, difficult case, albeit using a narrative was riddled with problems.", "In 1985, Steven Avery was wrongly convicted of rape and attempted murder and, in a strange turn of events, he and his then-teenage nephew, Brendan Dassey, were later convicted for the murder of photographer Teresa Halbach.", "Whilst the series rightfully raised questions around the police’s coerced confession from Brendan Dassey", ", it crafted a false narrative to suit its case in favour of Avery’s innocence, excluding vital evidence that suggested Avery did kill Halbach.", "Penny Beerntsen, the woman whom Avery was falsely accused of assaulting, declined to appear in Making a Murderer chiefly due to her belief that the filmmakers had already decided Avery was innocent and that they were not interested in “seeking the truth”.", "The Staircase had a similar problem where the filmmakers clearly decided to portray their subject as innocent, regardless of whether the evidence suggested otherwise.", "It’s important to note that The Staircase was a French miniseries originally created by director Jean-Xavier de Lestrade and later re-released with an additional three episodes by Netflix.", "Yet the point stands on the basis that the streaming platform chose this miniseries despite existing criticism and accusations of strong bias in the portrayal of Michael Peterson, a man charged with murdering his wife Kathleen Peterson.", "The show omitted a shocking number of important facts to portray Peterson favourably and in a further unethical twist, it was later revealed that one of the editors had an affair with Peterson himself.", "Documentary filmmakers shouldn’t be afraid to ruffle feathers. We’ve seen what true crime documentaries can do when they provoke.", "Cold cases are seen in a new light, new laws are passed and in some cases, wrongful convictions are overturned.", "Errol Morris’s The Thin Blue Line (1988) is famous for contributing to the reversal of a life sentence for Randall Dale Adams, wrongfully convicted for murder and falsely imprisoned by the state of Texas for twelve years.", "However, there’s a danger of not being objective enough. Warping the narrative to fit a particular point is already considered a dishonest practice in documentary filmmaking, but when you combine it with a true-crime it becomes irresponsible and cruel.", "How must Teresa Halbach’s family have felt when Making a Murderer painted Steven Avery in a far less suspicious light?", "How did those who loved Kathleen Peterson feel when Netflix decided to re-platform The Staircase? This leads to our next problem: Netflix has a harmful obsession with the perpetrators of true crime.", "We all laughed at Tiger King because, really, how could you not? For my money, the sight of Joe Exotic’s former presidential campaign manager Josh describing the campaign as the worst year of his life before wheezing on his vape has to be the top comedy moment of 2020.", "It was a bizarre, complex tale of rivalries turned murderous where every person involved was the definition of a “character”.", "But the documentary failed to really examine the actual crimes of Joe Exotic, brushing aside his arrest charges, the grooming of his husbands and perhaps most glaringly, his prolonged abuse of exotic animals, deciding instead to revel in the drama.", "Realising that we all spent a month giving further fame to a man like that makes you want to shower.", "The most egregious example of Netflix’s warped crush on perpetrators is Don’t F**k with Cats: Hunting an Internet Killer (2019), a series mainly focusing on animal abuse videos made by Luka Magnotta, a Canadian who would later film his murder of international student Lin Jun.", "It’s one of the most repulsive, morally bankrupt and sensationalist true crime documentaries I’ve ever sat through.", "When I suggest that Netflix move away from its current bland formula, I don’t suggest that it goes to this end of the spectrum.", "This kind of media has no interest in being anything but graphic, salacious, and downright disrespectful regardless of whosoever it hurts.", "It was genuinely shocking to see and hear that much of Magnotta’s hideous snuff videos in a piece of mainstream media.", "It simply did not need to show as much graphic imagery as it did and by doing so, it crossed a significant ethical line.", "It feels important to note that Magnotta’s videos were hardly unearthed for this documentary as they, unfortunately, had gone viral between 2010–2012.", "Simply put, these videos were already far too accessible on the internet. To prove this point, I timed how long it would take to find Magnotta’s snuff video and disturbingly, it took 30-seconds through Google.", "As we have already established, it is not necessary to promote this kind of disturbing material when the internet does enough of that as it is, and showcasing shock value content to boost viewings is truly foul.", "Forensic psychiatrist and criminologist Dr Park Dietz once broke down how we could prevent the rise of school shooters through changing our media coverage.", "He described the most common motive for school shootings was fame, or rather infamy, asking that the media stopped feeding into this.", "“I have repeatedly told CNN and our other media, if you don’t want to propagate more mass murders, don’t start the story with sirens blaring.", "Don’t have photographs of the killer. Don’t make this 24/7 coverage. Do everything you can not to make the body count the lead story, not to make the killer some kind of anti-hero.", "Do localise the story to the affected community and make it as boring as possible in every other market.", "Because every time we have intense saturation coverage of a mass murder, we expect to see one or two more within a week.”", "Sadly, Netflix’s true crime originals often fall into this trap. Shows such as Conversations with a Killer: The Ted Bundy Tapes (2019), Don’t F*** with Cats, and I Am A Killer (2018) give murderers a glorified, intriguing image which, once applied, becomes hard to remove.", "It would do Netflix some good to step back and question precisely who they are helping become anti-heroes.", "It is a truly haunting thought that you could become a footnote in your own murder if your story was told like the above examples.", "Ultimately, consuming true crime is a tricky business. It wouldn’t be a stretch to say it can quickly turn into an unhealthy obsession that desensitises those involved.", "It’s crucial for anyone interested in true crime to question why exactly it appeals to them as a subject.", "At the same time, it is fair to say that people will inevitably always be drawn to the darker side of human nature.", "Netflix has no intention to slow down its true-crime output and, honestly, this article isn’t a call for them to do so.", "The platform is still my go-to streaming service. However, the problems surrounding its true-crime originals have become too hard to ignore and, even worse, they’re actively ruining my enjoyment of these shows.", "This isn’t only my opinion, as we’re starting to see this reflected in reviews and backlash.", "My advice to Netflix? Change it up! Try something new in your approach. Don’t be afraid to confront hard truths and controversial subjects once armed with plenty of research.", "At the same time, know when to draw the line and remember to respect those affected by crimes. Stop giving narcissistic, destructive people like Luka Magnotta and Ted Bundy so much airtime because by doing so, you become part of the problem.", "Netflix used to create engaging true crime documentaries that you could binge-watch in one sitting. Now, it takes me two weeks to finish six episodes.", "It’s certainly true that my own internal examinations have shifted my interests in true crime to a more empathetic, compassionate approach — which, frankly, we don’t see enough of in the mainstream.", "Regardless, it’s clear that Netflix’s approach to true crime is only becoming increasingly weak and troubling.", "Whatever they have planned for the future, I hope that the outcome is more engaging and compassionate and picks up on the weaknesses identified."]}

He called his company “the anti-Apple” because it shares so much sensitive information about its business across departments internally.", "“We’re like the anti-Apple — you know how they compartmentalize,” he said. “We did the opposite — which is everybody gets all the information.”", "And he explained that he tries to give his team enough responsibility and for him to not rock the boat at the streaming giant, which is now valued at $135 billion.", "“I pride myself on making as few decisions as possible in a quarter,” Hastings said. “We’re getting better and better at that.", "Sometimes I can go a whole quarter without making any decisions.”"]}

And that’s the kind of change we typically aim for in Silicon Valley.", "But more often, innovation happens slowly. And Reed Hastings knew early on that Netflix needed both kinds of innovation.", "They started by sending DVDs in the mail, and evolved into a streaming video service with original content.", "HASTINGS: Much of the time, the right strategy is to improve what you’ve got, and then some of the time, everything changes – and correctly recognizing the differences there is really important.", "Humans are inventing faster and faster, and that does mean that the typical business model is shorter lived than it would have been before.", "So I’m not expecting internet streaming to be 5,000 years, like the horse. But it may be like the automobile, where it’s 100 years or more.", "HOFFMAN: Now that’s the sort of foundational insight that not only drove Netflix strategy, but also defined their culture.", "Here’s why: Reed could see that he needed a team that could develop a first-rate logistics operation for shipping DVDs.", "And at some point, that same team would have shed all of that logistical expertise and build an online streaming service from scratch.", "So who the heck can make that leap? Certainly not someone who’s worked in a mailroom for 50 years and developed an expertise in shipping little red envelopes.", "Reed knew he needed flexible problem-solvers who could change with the times, and he built a company culture for and with them.", "It’s a great example of why I believe there are many good company cultures and many bad company cultures, but a winning company culture emerges when every employee feels they personally own the culture.", "HOFFMAN: I’m Reid Hoffman, co-founder of LinkedIn, investor at Greylock, and your host. And I believe that a strong culture is critical to companies that hope to scale.", "But truly strong company cultures emerge only when every employee feels they personally own the culture.", "And by strong culture, I don’t mean authoritative. Quite the contrary, a strong culture should be a true articulation of how your employees work at their best.", "It should be grounded in your shared mission, the thing you’re actually trying to accomplish. It should be understood by everyone and built by everyone.", "And it should start from your earliest days as a startup.", "But the question remains: How do you get everyone across the org to share your values, without stifling diversity and hiring in your own image?", "And trickier still, how do you spread those values when you’re hiring new employees by the hundreds?", "On today’s episode I’m going to talk with Reed Hastings, the CEO of Netflix, about his journey from a dysfunctional culture in the first phase of his career, to the high-performing culture he nurtures at Netflix.", "At times, you might find it a bit awkward that Reed Hastings and I have almost the same name. But we’re going to push past that.", "As the episode continues, I’ll simply refer to him as “Reed.”", "We’re going to come to the Reed Hastings story in a moment. But I want to start at the beginning here.", "If you want to build a strong culture, the first thing you have to do is open your eyes. You have to start observing your culture the instant you arrive at the office – as soon as you walk through the front door.", "Margaret Heffernan, former CEO of five companies, can spot the warning signs in just a few paces from the front door to the front desk.", "MARGARET HEFFERNAN: When you walk into a company, you instantly learn a huge amount. There are all sorts of cliches and truisms about first impressions.", "But actually, what you see when you walk in is almost always what you get when you get to know the company better.", "HOFFMAN: So as the world’s lone expert on reception desks, I had to ask Margaret: What’s the friendliest reception she’s ever received?", "HEFFERNAN: I can think of a company in San Francisco that I’ve written about a lot, called Method home care products, where the founders and senior people in the company actually take turns being the receptionist, because they want to know who is coming to see them.", "HOFFMAN: At this remarkably welcoming company, the leadership team doesn’t just hand their employees manuals on how to behave, neither are they passive observers.", "They embody their cultural principles. I believe that a healthy culture emerges only when every employee, from the CEO to the receptionist, opts into the culture every day.", "The cultural principles themselves can change over time. They can vary from company to company, and they can strike outsiders as really bizarre.", "That’s all fine. But the one thing must remain constant: your staff must truly believe in your office culture.", "It’s best to start thinking about this when your team is small, and the culture is still malleable. A company’s culture cements very quickly.", "So as you grow, you have to be very careful about what it is you’re scaling. You can get away with a lot more when your staff is teeny; say, two or three people.", "And that’s exactly the sort of team Reed Hastings was leading back in 1991. Long before he had founded Netflix, he was a programmer.", "Reed, along with two of his colleagues, invented a debugging tool for other programmers. They called it Purify, and it was a hit.", "HASTINGS: First round of funding was family and friends – 20 people by 20K – to be able to get an office and start selling.", "And then we doubled every year. And it was in one way tremendous: Morgan Stanley took us public in 1995, we acquired all these companies.", "But in another way, it was terrible, because we got more and more bureaucratic, less and less inventive, less and less fun.", "And it was that classic, “Company got soft and political as it got bigger.”", "HOFFMAN: Consider what Reed Hastings was up against. He was a programmer, not an experienced executive.", "He was acquiring companies, which means whole teams, with their own hardened working habits, were slapped together.", "At one point, his company, Pure Software, acquired three companies in the span of 18 months. And as the culture eroded, Reid had a solution … of sorts.", "HASTINGS: I was coding all night, trying to be CEO in the day, and once in a while would squeeze in a shower.", "And it turns out that’s not a good recipe for leading a large group of people.", "At the time, I thought if I could just do more sales calls, more travel, write more code, do more interviews, that somehow it would work out better.", "I don’t think I ever really escaped from that, until the company got acquired by our largest competitor in 1997, six years after starting.", "HOFFMAN: So Reed made a very typical mistake in his first company. He thought he could solve his company’s problems just by working harder.", "But hard work isn’t enough, and more work is never the real answer.", "To succeed as you scale, you have to leverage every person in the organization. And to do that, you have to be very intentional about how you craft the culture.", "This was exactly the lesson Reed took from Pure Software.", "HASTINGS: Well, the mistakes in Pure was that every time we had a significant error – sales call didn’t go well, bug in the code – we tried to think about it in terms of what process could we put in place to ensure that this doesn’t happen again, and thereby improving the company?", "And what we failed to understand is by dummy-proofing all the systems, that we would have a system where only dummies wanted to work there, which was exactly what happened.", "And so the average intellectual level fell, and then the market changed and we were unable to adapt to it, because we had a bunch of people who valued following the process rather than the first-principle thinking.", "HOFFMAN: Notice Reed’s double insight here. Pure Software couldn’t adapt because they had the wrong employees, and they had the wrong employees because of management decisions that explicitly selected for those employees.", "This insight catapulted Reed as he set out to build Netflix. And we’ll come back to the Netflix story in a moment.", "As we’re releasing this episode just a week after Travis Kalanick stepped down as CEO of Uber, amid a slew of controversies over the company’s culture, we thought that was worth noting.", "Reed Hastings experience at Pure Software was a relatively benign example of how company culture can go astray.", "Uber was more toxic. If you permit – or encourage – abusive, excessive or exclusionary behavior early on, it’s very hard to reverse those organizational habits.", "Our producer Dan Kedmey called Adam Grant to get his take on what happened at Uber, and what other founders could learn from it.", "Adam’s a professor at the Wharton School of Management, and author of Give and Take, and a friend. In examining the cultural collapse at Uber, Adam sees broader themes at play, beginning with the way the founders envision their role in the world:", "ADAM GRANT: I often think about people on a spectrum of givers and takers. And there’s this belief in Silicon Valley that if you want to be disruptive and you want to be sort of a CEO who drives a major innovation change then you have to be a taker.", "You look at Uber and you think, well you know they had to break all these rules, they had a fight with taxi companies, they had to, you know, sidestep laws in multiple states and countries, and you need a bunch of takers who are willing to just go in and take what they feel they deserve and what is ultimately right for their business.", "The data don’t support that story at all. It’s a giant myth. And so what you really want, if you want to drive disruption, is you want disagreeable givers.", "The people who enjoy conflict, who like to challenge the status quo and rock the boat but are motivated to do that in service of helping other people be successful or achieving a meaningful organizational goal.", "HOFFMAN: Adam’s takeaways have a lot in common with what Reed Hastings shared earlier. Great companies hinge on both the people you hire, and the culture you build to keep them.", "GRANT: I think as a founder if you’re trying to build a culture, the first thing you do is you say, “It is nice to have the right people on your bus but it is even more critical to keep the wrong people off your bus.”", "And actually Mark Chussil has a great article about this. He says we all have our “To Do” lists but we forget to make “To Don’t” lists, a list of the things that we won’t do.", "And I think that every founder should have one of these when it comes to hiring: What are the qualities that I am absolutely unwilling to let into the organization?", "DAN KEDMEY: So I’m sure we have plenty of young founders who are listening to the podcast right now. Like at what point should they start thinking about this issue?", "GRANT: Yesterday. It’s never too early to think about the culture that you’re shaping. And it’s a lot easier to shape culture through who you let in the door than through trying to radically change people’s behaviors.", "HOFFMAN: So we’ve seen two examples here of how culture can go astray. One of them, Pure Software, relatively benign.", "And one of them, Uber, rather toxic. In either case, culture sticks. And if you don’t want your company to get bogged down in corrosive or downright scandalous behavior, you have to avoid the bog to begin with.", "With the lessons of Pure Software fresh in his mind, Reed treaded carefully into the next phase of his career.", "Pure Software sold for $750 million. That gave Reed the seed money to launch Netflix in 1997. It started as a service that mailed DVDs to your door.", "And it’s easy to forget just how radically Netflix upended the video rental business from day one. No late fees.", "No extra shipping charges. Lose a DVD? Get a new one in the mail, no questions asked. Their most fearsome competitor, Blockbuster, quickly followed suit, matching service for service, but not quite fast enough.", "Blockbuster filed for bankruptcy in 2010, and shrunk from 9,000 stores at its height to roughly 10 stores today, 8 of which are reportedly in a frigid part of Alaska with sluggish internet service.", "But there’s a deeper reason Netflix was able to outmaneuver a company more than 100 times its size. It’s not a story of competition, but cooperation, a cultural flourishing that took place within Netflix’s headquarters.", "It was a culture built almost as a counterpoint to Pure Software.", "HASTINGS: We were unable to adapt to it, because we had a bunch of people who valued following the process rather than the first-principle thinking.", "HOFFMAN: A bit of background on first principle thinking – you’ll hear this expression a lot in Silicon Valley.", "First principle thinking is the idea that everything you do is underpinned by foundational beliefs – or “first principles.”", "Instead of blindly following directions, or sticking to a process, a first principle thinker will constantly ask, “What’s best for the company?", "And couldn’t we do it this other way instead?” And these are the kinds of inquisitive minds that Reed Hastings wanted to unleash on Netflix, for virtually every decision.", "HASTINGS: And so the reverse of that, which we do at Netflix, is you have to be a first principle thinker.", "There’s an overhead to that about what’s best for the company. So this is true on the broad scale, like what kind of content we do.", "It’s also true in the micro, which is, “How should I travel: Business, or coach, or by bus?”", "And we ask people to do what you would think is best for the company. We don’t give them any more guidelines than that.", "And some people that frustrates, but those are probably not the people that’s a good match for Netflix.", "And other people like this sort of first-principle thinking all the time.", "HOFFMAN: This may sound like the sort of advice a tech entrepreneur would naturally follow. Who wouldn’t want to hire a first principle thinker?", "Well, it’s easy to tell yourself that in the abstract. But when you’re running a fast-growing company, you’re also going to be telling yourself, “I desperately need a sales expert, a programmer, a designer, an accounting whiz” – and you’ll find applicants who have resumes with all of the skills suited for that moment.", "It’s all too tempting to tell yourself, “Well, we’ll find a first-principle thinker with the next hire.”", "Just look at what happened to Reed when he was at Pure Software. He’s a first-principle thinker. You’d think he’d hire other first principle thinkers.", "Game recognizes game, right? And yet he neglected that hiring standard for six years. That is why you must define your culture before you scale.", "And you have to think deeply about what cultural attributes you want to preserve at scale.", "Reed gave this a lot of thought in the founding days of Netflix. He wasn’t just looking backwards, at the lessons learned from Pure; he was also looking ahead, where he saw an enormous threat to the company.", "Forget Blockbuster, how would Netflix survive the dawn of online streaming? Broadband internet was making its way into households across the US.", "It seemed inevitable to Reed that streaming entertainment would eclipse DVDs, just as surely as the combustion engine eclipsed the horse and carriage.", "And here’s what makes Reed such a fantastic strategic thinker: He was fretting about this in the late ’90s, when broadband internet had reached fewer than 1 in 10 households.", "To comprehend why Reed hires first-principle thinkers at Netflix, you have to remember how he views these technological shifts.", "Innovations generally happen incrementally – except for those moments when everything dramatically changes.", "HASTINGS: If we continued to refine DVD-by-mail for another two decades, that would have been a failure strategy, because the underlying substrate was changing, and internet delivery was becoming possible.", "But now that we’re in internet delivery, we think that Internet television is going to be a 50 or 100-year paradigm.", "And so now our focus should shift to be, how do we do better and better on the core?", "HOFFMAN: Reed’s knowledge of history, the changing nature of technology, and the historical moment he was in, led to the understanding he would need people to change with the times.", "People who could rip up a process, and return to the first principles of delivering entertainment by any means necessary, whether it’s horseback, mail, fiber optic cable, or maybe in the future, Elon Musk’s neural lace.", "Regardless, you need people who can change the business model, fast.", "So how did Reed identify those candidates? It started with a now-legendary document at Netflix, a collection of more than 100 slides known as the “Culture Deck.”", "These slides defined exactly what the Netflix culture stands for, and who they’re trying to hire, and what they can expect.", "HASTINGS: The culture deck started about 10 years ago. So first couple of years, we were just focused on survival, then we got public in 2002, cash-flow positive", "and it was clear we were going to survive. So we then started really thinking about the culture: what we wanted to be, how we wanted to operate.", "And so over successive years, I improved this deck which I would go through with new employees. And sometimes those new employees would love it, sometimes they were like, “Oh my god, why didn’t you tell me this before I started?", "That doesn’t make sense to me.” And so we realized we should give it to every candidate.", "And so then about 2007, 2008, we did that by posting it on SlideShare. But again, it was really just to be able to send a link to the candidates.", "It’s not very pretty, it’s not very highly designed, doesn’t look like it’s an external marketing piece, but that authenticity, really, people liked in the outside world, and now it’s over 10 million views on SlideShare, and continues to be studied around the world.", "HOFFMAN: And what were the unexpected benefits of having published it?", "HASTINGS: Well the core benefit, which we did expect, was that candidates were very aware of the culture.", "The unexpected benefit was many people became candidates for us, because they loved that – what we described in terms of freedom and responsibility – that might not have otherwise thought about us.", "HOFFMAN: Here’s the fascinating thing about Netflix’s culture deck. It’s not meant to appeal to every job seeker.", "HOFFMAN: One of the things that I think that shocks people about the Netflix culture document is they say, “Look, adequate performance should get you a severance package.”", "What’s the way that you both create that high performance, but also doesn’t feel too dangerous to people?", "HASTINGS: We try to always emphasize honesty. So you can always ask your manager, “Hey, if I were leaving, how hard would you work to change my mind to stay?”", "That’s sort of the acid test, I would call it the “keeper test.” So we encourage people to check in with their manager on that.", "So we try to be very thoughtful, so it should be that there’s no surprises about that.", "And we all aspire to excellent performance, and there’s no short-term judgment, or like, “Last week you made a mistake, and so you’re out.”", "It’s not like that at all. It’s about, really, the expectation of future contribution, which is based on a range of factors and performance to date.", "HOFFMAN: This keeper test may sound a bit Darwinian. No one wants to hear a manager say, “I wouldn’t fight to keep you.", "Thanks for playing.” But I actually believe it’s more compassionate to ask this question, repeatedly.", "You have to be thoughtful about who fits in, and who clashes with their coworkers.", "Suppose a manager decides to keep a brilliant jerk on the team. Morale sags. The team’s performance drops.", "Then you have a truly Darwinian struggle on your hands. And in that sense, the keeper test cuts both ways.", "A manager can fail it as surely as any employee. That’s why a commitment to culture must pervade every decision.", "Without a clear sense of how staff should work together, it’s all too easy for managers to narrow their focus on individual players.", "And emphasizing individual performance, at the expense of the team, can be downright hazardous to an organization, as Margaret Heffernan has observed.", "HEFFERNAN: There is often a belief among very successful, very competitive people, that the thing you want to do in a company is get everybody to compete with each other.", "That if it’s “Everybody’s racing against everybody,” you’ll have this kind of white heat of brilliance and creativity.", "And I think pretty much everything about that’s wrong. And that’s not to say that I’m not competitive – I’m deeply competitive with myself, in the sense that I really want to do a better job today than I did yesterday.", "And I have seen more companies and organizations go wrong, because of what I think of as negative competitiveness: “I do want you to fail,” or, “I want your department to fail,” or, “I want your product to fail, because that will make me shine.”", "I’ve seen more damage and destruction and waste from that mentality than probably from any other misunderstanding.", "If you can build an environment in which people really want to help each other, full of people who are generous, you will do infinitely better than creating some kind of Olympic sport within the company.", "HOFFMAN: Here we come to the essence of a strong culture. It serves as a check on selfish ambition. It’s a civilizing force that excludes anyone who will drag down the team, and also welcomes anyone who elevates the team.", "In short, it’s warm but not cuddly. And if that sounds a bit paradoxical, Reed Hastings has a clarifying analogy.", "You’ll never hear him refer to his colleagues as a “family.” It’s a term that visibly grates at him. He likens Netflix instead to a sports team.", "They expect high performance from their players, and they use internal collaboration as a tool to drive external competitiveness.", "HASTINGS: In team sports that really succeed there often is a lot of warmth between the players. And so it’s emphasizing those aspects, and demonstrating that when people come in, everyone tries to help them.", "But ultimately, it is about performance, unlike a family, which is really about unconditional love. Even if your brother does something awful and goes to jail, your love doesn’t stop.", "And that’s just a different and important part of society, but that’s not what we’re about. What we’re about is collectively changing the world in the areas of internet television, and that takes incredible performance at every level.", "We’re also about really honest feedback all the time, so you can learn and be the best that you can be.", "HOFFMAN: So let it be known that Netflix does not promise unconditional love, and they’re exceptionally frank about this in their culture deck, which every prospective employee reads.", "This has become a powerful tool for them, one that creates a built-in filter to every hire. It’s a great hack that other companies would be smart to adopt.", "Because the hiring process is a critical – but often overlooked – part of maintaining company culture.", "When you’re growing and hiring fast, it’s easy to place expediency over excellence.", "You’ll often find yourself tempted to hire perfectly-qualified candidates, who you know, in your gut, are not a fit with your cultural values.", "So how do you resist the urge to hire a candidate who is brilliant, qualified, perfect in every way – with the sole exception that they might clash with the company’s culture?", "I asked Jeff Weiner, the CEO of LinkedIn, how he does it. “With reluctance,” he told me – until he saw the consequences of the decision.", "JEFF WEINER: I remember early on in my tenure at LinkedIn, we were around the table, call it a hiring committee, a small group of people responsible for evaluating new prospects.", "We were evaluating some LinkedIn profiles, and there was one profile in particular for a very important role, and the person who was sponsoring this prospect said, “Look at this profile, look at the background, look at this experience, look at the skill set.", "I mean, we couldn’t find anyone better. I should warn everyone, I don’t know that they’re the right kind of cultural fit for us, based on the following.", "And inevitably, when you try to pull that off, inevitably, it almost never does. And it becomes very expensive in terms of time, energy, and even resources working through that.", "Fast forward about six to nine months, and we were around the table, very similar group of people, evaluating somebody’s profile, and someone said, “Check out this profile, look at this background, look at this set of experiences and skills, just unbelievable.", "But they’re not a cultural fit, so let’s move on to the next candidate.”", "And that’s when you know you’re in a position where you can scale, especially when that discussion is taking place and you’re not in the room.", "HOFFMAN: Notice how Jeff points out that this willingness to reject A-players has to persist, even after he leaves the room.", "Some CEOs, like Aneel Bhusri, co-founder and CEO of Workday, refuse to leave the room until the team has made this decision so many times, it’s a reflex.", "ANEEL BHUSRI: In the early days, it’s just you and a few other people, so we just did it ourselves. We set out to interview the first 500 people.", "HOFFMAN: To be clear, by “we,” Aneel means he was personally involved in interviewing the first 500 hires for cultural fit.", "BHUSRI: And we would test on whether they were an “I” person or “we” person – we were looking for “we” people – we were looking for people that had a clear driver for why they wanted to be successful.", "We were looking for people that were high integrity. We were looking for people that did not job-hop.", "And you could look at a resume, you can tell if they’re the shiny, new-penny type that jumps from one op to another.", "We were looking at people that were going to be with us for seven, eight, nine, 10 years.", "We just did a town hall a couple days ago, and we’ve got tons of people who have been with us 10 years.", "And that’s how you build a great company. So I was interviewing those first 500 people.", "HOFFMAN: And it’s somewhat obvious from this, given that you set up that initial culture, but how then, past the first 500, did you help keep that?", "BHUSRI: Well, we kept interviewing people after the first 500, but we armed those first group of people.", "We decided, I think it was at a company meeting, to say, “OK, now you guys are on the hook. You interview the next 5,000.", "Make sure the next 5,000 people are great cultural fits.”", "HOFFMAN: I want to acknowledge the risk of this conversation. A strong culture is great for team performance, but you also run the risk of defining your culture so narrowly, that the founding team starts hiring in their own image.", "And if your founders are a bunch of young, Ivy League white guys hiring other young, Ivy League white guys, you’re not just being biased, you’re being foolish.", "You want a strong adaptive team? You need different perspectives.", "Tristan Walker, the founder and CEO of Walker & Co., considers the diversity of his staff a strategic advantage.", "They’re hard at work developing health and beauty products for people of color, which his competitors mistake for a niche market.", "It only looks niche when you’re surrounded by white people, he argues.

But a company that writes off people in the way Netflix does—Hastings endorses “firing a good employee when you think you can get a great one”—may not be devoting sufficient time to the question of how they might invest in good, hardworking employees to help make them great.", "Research shows that subpar performance can often be traced back to a manager who has created an unhealthy dynamic via low expectations or lack of confidence, as Jean-François Manzoni and Jean-Louis Barsoux explain in their book The Set-Up-to-Fail Syndrome.", "“Having made up his mind about a subordinate’s limited ability and poor motivation, a manager is likely to notice supporting evidence while selectively dismissing contrary evidence,” the pair write in Harvard Business Review.", "In No Rules Rules, Hastings downplays the potential pain caused by firings. For example, discussing his dismissal of former Netflix chief talent officer Patty McCord, who helped create the Keeper Test herself, he writes:", "“I started feeling that it would be best for us to have someone new in the role. I shared those thoughts with Patty, and we talked about what was leading me there.", "As it turned out she wanted to work less, so she left Netflix and it was very amicable.”", "McCord would agree that she and Hastings are still close, but her recounting of events is markedly different.", "“What I was surprised by was the profound sadness that I wouldn’t be part of it anymore,” she told Alex Blumberg on the podcast Without Fail.", "In McCord’s telling, the ouster wasn’t a completely mutual decision, nor does she describe it as a convenient way for her to work less.", "Indeed, Netflix often seems to try to skirt the question of the mental toll of getting fired, a position that McCord herself takes in a 2013 interview with NPR’s Steve Henn:", "HENN: How many people do you think you have fired?", "MCCORD: Oh, I would really like to remove that word from our vocabulary. It’s like, we don’t shoot people.", "HENN: OK. What word do you like? Severed is no less pleasant than fired.", "McCord’s preference for the phrase “move on” rather than “fire” may well be intended to reflect the fact that Netflix employees aren’t necessarily let go because of poor performance.", "At the same time, it suggests a certain refusal to consider the emotional toll of the Keeper Test too deeply.", "Ultimately, the Keeper Test is the result of a mindset that employees are disposable. In this sense, Netflix isn’t so different from a lot of other American companies.", "What’s new about the Keeper Test isn’t so much the end result (people getting fired, or worrying about the prospect of getting fired) but rather the company’s position that the test is a good thing, and even a selling point.", "In The End of Loyalty: The Rise and Fall of Good Jobs in America, author Rick Wartzman writes about how the post-World War II social contract that once existed between workers and their employers was gradually undone by the idea, brought to the fore by the economist Milton Friedman in the 1970s, that a business’s primary obligation was to its shareholders.", "Wartzman describes the shift as a move away from “this kind of ‘we’ mentality—we’re all in this together coming out of the Great Depression and the Great War—and moving more to an age of I, the individual,” as he told NPR.", "“The marketplace is sacrosanct, and it’s all about, you know, lifting ourselves up.”", "There are echoes of this in McCord’s framing of the culture she helped create: “Companies don’t exist to make you happy.", "You know that, right? The business doesn’t exist to serve you. The business exists to serve your customers,” she told Fast Company in 2016.", "But while companies don’t exist to make employees happy, the growing white-collar labor movement and the rise of conscious capitalism in the business world suggest that the relationship between companies and their workers may once again be on the brink of change.", "Even powerful CEOs like JPMorgan Chase’s Jamie Dimon and Walmart’s Doug McMillon are at least paying lip service to the idea that the purpose of companies isn’t just to serve customers or shareholders, but to take the interests of employees and communities into account, too.", "The Keeper Test is the logical product of a culture where job security is largely a relic of the past.", "Netflix’s high pay and severance packages doubtless mitigate some of the damage. But they don’t supply an answer to the moral argument that, given what we know about the impact that unemployment has on people’s mental health—and, in the US, on their access to health insurance and ability to find a new job—the bar for firing people should be high, not low."]}

adds that the AP team will consult Zacks Investment Research and pay attention to what the Street is saying through consensus models to determine whether a story needs correcting.", "This throws up a potential point of vulnerability for small-cap companies looking to correct stories, as Posen illustrates: ‘We have two analysts covering us and the gap between their consensus numbers is relatively wide – so the numbers aren’t as relevant as the numbers we would guide to.’", "Accurate sell-side research coverage is a perennial challenge for small caps, even without the projected disruption that Mifid II will prompt.", "From April 2018 onwards, AP changed the headlines of the automated stories to call them ‘earnings snapshots’ rather than reflecting a positive or negative trend from results.", "This serves as a form of disclaimer that these stories aren’t a source of in-depth financial journalism, Gibbs says.", "‘Anyone expecting to truly understand a company’s business and financial picture would be doing far more due diligence than just consulting a 100-word story from AP,’ she adds.", "In Telaria’s case, however, Posen says both retail investors and hedge funds have

management team and proactively called around to some of his retail investors to make sure they understood the story.", "Gibbs says AP would consider turning off automated stories for a specific company if there was a good case for it and a consistent pattern of stories that required correction.", "Indeed, she says AP has decided to selectively turn off automated stories when a certain industry has faced accounting challenges that could result in misleading stories.", "This was most recently the case during the first earnings season after the US tax reform was passed, when many

500 and his research finds that stories with more original reporting and less content reproduced from an earnings release increase trading volume and improve price discovery.", "Guest notes that WSJ articles will likely have a broader audience, one that includes potential retail investors, than newswire coverage from the likes of AP and Reuters, which tend to feed into investor terminals such as Bloomberg.", "‘As most readers of earnings coverage are also investors, or at least potential investors, any value relevant information in an article will likely be reflected in their subsequent trading and ultimately in market prices,’ Guest points out in his research paper.", "‘Absent a press article, some or all of these investors would have to gather and process the information themselves.’", "The impact on trading and price discovery would therefore be delayed.", "Essentially, automated stories can lead to greater liquidity, but stories with added input from journalists can also yield price discovery.", "Although Guest’s study was concerned with the WSJ ’s output, it’s worth noting that all other publications mentioned in this article as using some form of automated earnings reporting – such as AP, Bloomberg and Reuters – still operate full newsrooms that contribute analysis and reporting to earnings stories.", "At Reuters, Reginald Chua, COO of editorial, is

company.", "‘It will send something to a journalist writing about IBM with the basic facts, like what the market closed at,’ Chua says.", "‘But then it will say things like, The market closed up for five days in a row, the first time it has done so since January.", "Then it can go on and say the number of analysts who rated the company a buy and how that has changed in the last six months.’",

activity isn’t known, but both academic studies referenced in this article make a case for financial disclosures having some effect on stock performance.", "Both Chua and Gibbs say they aren’t ready to let this kind of automation loose on the world without being filtered by a human just yet.", "But there’s also a sense that this brave new world of business journalism isn’t too far away.",

Revenue rose 99.4% YOY in Q4 FY 2021 and analysts expect it to increase by 80.7% in Q1 FY 2022.", "Despite this improvement, revenue for the segment would still be below levels reached prior to the adverse shock from the pandemic.", "Disney+ subscribers is another key metric that will receive investors' attention.

Subscriber growth slowed to 209.3% YOY in the second quarter, then to 101.7% YOY in the third, and to 60.2% YOY in the fourth quarter.", "Analysts expect the deceleration trend to continue in Q1 FY 2022, forecasting Disney+ subscribers to grow 31.8% YOY."]}

And as we approach that remarkable milestone, I am filled with optimism.", "We have the world’s most creative storytelling engine and unmatched collection of brands and franchises and an ability to tell stories that form deep emotional connections with audiences.", "We have a portfolio of distribution platforms, including powerful and growing streaming services. We have diverse revenue streams that span business models and industries, but which all are interconnected to create entertainments most powerful synergy machine.", "We have the country’s top news organization and the most trusted brand for funnelling sports, and our theme parks continue to be the most magical places on earth.", "In short, our collection of assets and platforms create capabilities in unique place in the cultural zeitgeist, give me great confidence that we will continue to define entertainment for the next 100 years.", "To carry through on their promise, we will be guided by three strategic pillars; storytelling excellence, innovation and audience focus.", "Storytelling excellence is of course dependent on having excellent storytellers. I am thrilled to share that our legacy of being home for the most accomplished leaders in the industry will continue as nearly all of our top creative executives have recently renewed, extended or signed new contracts.", "I could not be more excited to continue working with this creative powerhouses.", "The quality content from our teams was recognized just yesterday with a fantastic 23 Oscar nominations, including three of the five best animated feature films; Pixar’s Luca, Walt Disney Animation’s Raya and the Last Dragon, and our newest franchise, Walt Disney Animation’s Encanto, which received three nominations.", "Summer of Soul was recognized in the best documentary category and Nightmare Alley and West Side Story both received best picture nominations.", "As you may have seen earlier today, we announced West Side Story will debut in most Disney+ markets on March 2, and we can’t wait for our subscribers to see this incredible film.", "In Q1, our studios took us deeper into the Marvel Cinematic Universe with Eternals and the Disney+ Originals series, Hawkeye, and returned us to that galaxy far, far away with another Disney+ Originals series The Book of Boba Fett.", "Our general entertainment teams also continued to produce programming of the highest quality. In fact, last year, our general entertainment team produced nearly a quarter of the industry’s best reviewed shows, and Q1 saw 10 of their shows achieve a 100% critics score on Rotten Tomatoes.", "That includes, Abbott Elementary, the first freshman broadcast comedy to earn the 100% certified fresh score since ABC’s own Modern Family in 2009.", "Our success in branded storytelling is of course no secret. However, it’s often lost at the depth, breadth and quality of our general entertainment content is also a driving force behind the success of our streaming services.", "In fact, six of the 10 most-watched programs across our services are general entertainment titles produced by our own team.", "And general entertainment is an increasingly powerful driver of engagement in most of our international markets where such content is already included in our service under the Star brand.", "Going forward, integrating more owned general entertainment into our services, especially Disney+, will be a priority.", "In fact, just today, we added episodes of Grown-ish, Black-ish and The Wonder Years to our domestic Disney+ service.", "Rounding out our content focuses is of course sports. Sporting events continue to be the most powerful draw on television, accounting for 95 of the 100 most-watched live broadcast in 2021.", "And ESPN once again set the bar this quarter with live games across each of our four major U.S. sports, including the revolutionary Monday Night With Peyton and Eli.", "And I am pleased to announce that we have expanded our agreement with Peyton Manning and his Omaha Productions Company to extend our relationship through the 2024 NFL season.", "And we’ll add alternative presentations for UFC, golf and college football events for each of the next three years.", "While multi-platform television industry will continue to be the foundation of sports coverage for the immediate future, we believe the opportunity for The Walt Disney Company goes well beyond these channels.", "The extent to the sports betting, gaming and the metaverse. In fact, that’s what excites us.

The continued growth of our streaming services was certainly a standout.", "Our success of Disney+ this quarter was not the result of any one item, but instead a combination of organic growth and powerful new content, our strategic decision to include the Disney Bundle with all Hulu Live subscriptions and new market launches.", "The remainder of this fiscal year will feature compelling Disney+ Originals from across our brands and franchises, beginning with Pixar’s Turning Red and Marvel Studios Moon Knight in March.", "And the back half of FY ’22 will feature a truly stunning array of content, including two Star Wars series; Andor and the highly anticipated, Obi-Wan Kenobi, which I am excited to announce will premiere on May 25.", "We’ll debut two Marvel series; Ms. Marvel and She-Hulk, fresh new shorts from Disney Animation and Pixar featuring the world’s of Big Hero 6 and Cars, a live-action reimagining of the Disney Classic Pinocchio starring Tom Hanks as Geppetto, and one of the most anticipated sequels in some time, especially in the Chapek household, Hocus Pocus 2.", "As I’ve said before, we continue to manage our services for the long-term and maintained confidence in our guidance of 230 million to 260 million total paid Disney+ subscribers globally by the end of fiscal 2024.", "Christine, will provide more detail into our theatrical results. However, I want to reiterate that we continue to see value in the movie-going experience, especially for big franchise blockbusters.", "And given the performance of titles like Spider-Man: No Way Home, we are looking forward to kicking off our summer slate with another Marvel franchise film, Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness.", "That said, audiences will be our North Star as we determine how our content is distributed. And we do not subscribe to the belief that theatrical distribution is the only way to build the Disney franchise.", "This quarter, audiences proved us right as Encanto became a phenomenon within days of its arrival on Disney+ after families’ continued reluctance to return to theaters resulted in a muted theatrical performance.", "With outstanding music from Lin-Manuel Miranda, it became the fastest titled across 200 million hours viewed on Disney+ and took social media by storm.", "People around the world expressed their fandom through their own content and conversation and the Encanto hashtag has been viewed more than 11 billion times.", "The soundtrack, which debuted at number 197 on the Billboard 200 chart, reached number one shortly after debuting on Disney+ and eight of the film songs hit the hot 100 chart, including We Don’t Talk About Bruno, which became the first Disney song to reach number one since Aladdin’s A Whole New World in 1993.", "At the same time, sales of Encanto merchandise defied traditional post-holiday declines and actually increased following the film’s release on Disney+ on Christmas Eve and guest at Disney California Adventure have loved seeing Mirabel in real life.", "These results are exactly what you would expect from the launch of a new Disney franchise, and we are thrilled that Disney+ was the catalyst.", "We are more confident than ever in this platform as a content service, a franchise engine and as a venue for the next generation of Disney storytelling.", "Finally, I could not be more pleased with the performance of our Parks, Experiences and Products segment, which posted its second-best quarter of all time.", "Over the last several years, we’ve transformed the guest experience by investing in new storytelling and groundbreaking technology and the records at our domestic parks are the direct result of this investment.", "From new franchise-based lands and attractions, to craveable food and beverage offerings, to must-have character merchandise, there is more great Disney storytelling infused into every aspect of a visit to our parks than ever before.", "At the same time, we’re giving guests new tools to personalize their visits and spend less time in line and more time having fun.", "While we anticipate that these products would be popular, we have been blown away by the reception. In the quarter, more than a third of domestic park guests purchased either Genie+, Lightning Lane or both.", "That number rose to more than 50% during the holiday period. While demand was strong throughout the quarter at both domestic sites, our reservation system enabled us to strategically manage attendance.", "In fact, their stellar performance was achieved at lower attendance levels than 2019.", "As we return to a more normalized environment, we look forward to more fully capitalizing on the extraordinary demand for our parks along with the already realized yield benefits that took shape this quarter, and we of course will continue to invest in the guest experience.", "I am personally looking forward to Star Wars: Galactic Starcruiser at Walt Disney World, a two-night adventure into the most immersive Star Wars story ever created.", "We are pleased with demand for this premium groundbreaking experience which will welcome guests starting on March 1.", "Later this summer, we will debut an innovative new roller coaster epcot, Guardians of the Galaxy: Cosmic Rewind and open Avengers Campus at Disneyland Paris where the iconic Quinjet landed a few weeks ago ahead of the resort’s 30th anniversary celebrations.", "I want to close by thanking our 195,000 employees for bringing Disney Magic to audiences and guests around the world, especially in times like these when the world needs it most.", "Our company is truly extraordinary, and I am honored to work with the most talented team in the industry to create the next generation of Disney stories and experiences through our focus on storytelling excellence, innovation and our audience.", "Christine M. McCarthy — Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Thanks, Bob, and good afternoon, everyone. Excluding certain items, diluted earnings per share for the quarter were $1.06, an increase of $0.74 from the prior year quarter.", "Fiscal 2022 is off to a good start, as evidenced by our first quarter results and our continued progress towards more normalized operations across our businesses.", "At Parks, Experiences and Products, operating income was up $2.6 billion year-over-year as all of our parks and resorts around the world were open for the entirety of the fiscal first quarter.", "In the prior year quarter, Walt Disney World Resort and Shanghai Disney Resort were open for the entire quarter, while Hong Kong Disneyland Resort and Disneyland Paris were each open for a limited number of weeks and Disneyland Resort was closed for the entire quarter.", "At our domestic parks, we were very pleased with the strong levels of demand we saw from both Walt Disney World and Disneyland.", "And as Bob mentioned, our reservation system has allowed us to strategically manage attendance. Overall, attendance trends at our domestic parks continued to strengthen in the quarter with Walt Disney World and Disneyland Q1 attendance up double-digits versus Q4, in part reflecting holiday seasonality.", "Per capita spending at our domestic parks was up more than 40% versus fiscal first quarter 2019, driven by a more favorable guest and ticket mix, higher food, beverage and merchandise spending and contributions from Genie+ and Lightning Lane.", "Putting these factors together, our domestic parks and resorts delivered Q1 revenue and operating income exceeding pre-pandemic levels even as we continued managing attendance to responsibly address ongoing COVID considerations.", "Looking ahead to Q2, our demand pipeline for domestic guests at Walt Disney World and Disneyland remains strong, benefiting from our 50th anniversary celebration at Walt Disney World and new attractions and experiences at both parks.", "At international parks, a profitable first quarter reflect an improving trends at Disneyland Paris. We also saw improved results at Hong Kong Disneyland, although the resort is now temporarily closed in response to a resurgence in COVID cases in the region.", "We expect international parks will continue to be impacted by COVID-related volatility for the remainder of Q2.", "Moving on to our Media and Entertainment Distribution segment, first quarter operating income decreased by more than $600 million versus the prior year as revenue growth across our lines of business was more than offset by higher programming and production costs.", "Revenue growth in the quarter was primarily driven by increased subscription fees from our direct-to-consumer services.", "We also delivered record advertising revenues for the segment as we continue to see strong advertiser demand for our live sports and streaming and digital businesses.", "Turning to our results by line of business. At Linear Networks, you may recall that we guided to a decrease in operating income of nearly $500 million for Q1 versus the prior year.", "Operating income of $1.5 billion came in better than expected, primarily driven by our international channel, which I’ll discuss in a minute.", "At our domestic channels, both broadcasting and cable operating income decreased in the first quarter versus the prior year.", "Lower results at broadcasting were impacted by an adverse comparison to prior year political advertising revenue at our owned television stations, as we noted in the guidance we gave last quarter.", "At cable, the year-over-year decrease in operating income reflected higher programming and production costs and increased marketing spend, partially offset by increases in advertising and affiliate revenue.", "Growth in advertising revenue was driven by ESPN as we benefited from the start of a normalized NBA calendar and increased viewership for football.", "ESPN advertising revenue in the first quarter was up 14% versus the prior year and second quarter to date domestic cash advertising sales at ESPN are currently pacing up.", "Total domestic affiliate revenue increased by 2% in the quarter. This was primarily driven by 6 points of growth from higher rates, offset by a 4 point decline due to a decrease in subscribers.", "Operating income at our International Channels decreased slightly versus the prior year. These results came in more than $200 million better than our prior guidance, primarily due to lower programming and production costs as well as better than expected advertising and affiliate revenues.", "At Direct-to-Consumer, first quarter operating results decreased by $127 million year-over-year, driven by higher losses at Disney+ and ESPN+, partially offset by improved results at Hulu.", "I’ll note that beginning this quarter, we are providing disclosure on our programming and production expenses by service as well as additional detail for Disney+ in our 10-Q. Operating losses at Disney+ increased versus the prior year as growth in subscription revenue was more than offset by higher programming, technology and marketing costs.", "We ended the quarter with nearly 130 million global paid Disney+ subscribers, reflecting over 11 million net additions from Q4.", "Taking a look at subscriber growth by region. We added 4.1 million paid domestic Disney+ subscribers, including a benefit of approximately 2 million incremental subscribers from our strategic decision to include Disney+ and ESPN+ as part of a Hulu Live subscription.", "In international markets, excluding Disney+ Hotstar, we added 5.1 million paid subscribers, primarily driven by growth in Asia Pacific and European markets.", "I’ll note that growth in Asia included the benefit of new market launches in South Korea, Taiwan and Hong Kong in the quarter.", "Finally, we were able to resume growth in Disney+ Hotstar markets with 2.6 million paid subscriber additions in the quarter.", "Overall, we are pleased with Disney+ subscriber growth in the quarter, and are looking forward to new market launches and a strong content slate later this year.", "As I’ve previously shared, we don’t anticipate that subscriber growth will necessarily be linear from quarter-to-quarter and we continue to expect growth in the back half of the fiscal year to exceed growth in the first half.", "At ESPN+, we ended the first quarter with over 21 million paid subscribers versus 17 million in Q4. Results decreased compared to the prior year as growth in subscription revenue was more than offset by higher sports programming costs, driven by the NHL and LaLiga.", "And at Hulu, higher subscription revenues versus the prior year were partially offset by higher programming and production costs, driven by increased affiliate fees for live TV.", "Hulu ended the first quarter with 45.3 million paid subscribers inclusive of 4.3 million subscribers to our Hulu Live digital MVPD service.", "Moving on to Content Sales/Licensing and Other. Results decreased in the first quarter versus the prior year to an operating loss of $98 million, driven by lower theatrical results and higher film impairments, partially offset by improved TV/SVOD results.", "As I noted last quarter, while theaters have generally reopened, we are still experiencing a prolonged recovery to theatrical exhibition, particularly for certain genres of films, including non-branded general entertainment and family-focused animation.", "This dynamic contributed to increased losses in the quarter as we released more titles in Q1 this year versus the prior year, resulting in lower theatrical results.", "This was partially offset by income from our co-production of Spider-Man: No Way Home.", "As we look ahead, we would like to give you some context around two items that may impact our second quarter results.", "First, as we continue to increase our investment in content, we expect programming and production costs at DMED to increase versus the prior year, primarily driven by Direct-to-Consumer and Linear Networks.", "At Direct-to-Consumer, we expect programming and production expenses to increase by approximately $800 million to $1 billion, including programming fees for Hulu Live.", "At Linear Networks, we expect programming and production expenses to increase by approximately $500 million, reflecting factors including COVID-related timing shifts.", "We aired four additional NFL games at the start of the current quarter. And as a reminder, the Academy Awards will be held in Q2 of this year, while they fell into Q3 of the prior year.", "Second, at Content Sales/Licensing and Other a difficult Q2 comparison to prior year TV/SVOD program sales is due in part to our strategic decision to hold more of our owned and produced content for our direct-to-consumer services.", "As a result, we expect operating income to be adversely impacted by more than $200 million versus the prior year quarter.", "With that, I’ll turn it back to Jenn, and we would be happy to take your questions.", "Jenn Kettnich — Vice President, Investor Relations", "Thanks, Christine. As we transition to the Q&A, let me note that since we are not physically together this afternoon, I will do my best to moderate the Q&A by directing your question to be appropriate executive.", "Also to help us get to as many analysts as possible today, we ask that you please limit yourself to one question.", "And with that, operator, we’re ready for the first question.", "Our first question comes from Ben Swinburne with Morgan Stanley.", "Thanks. Good afternoon, and thank you for the additional disclosure. Bob, I wanted to ask you about Disney+.", "Either the U.S. subscriber base or I guess the U.S. and Canadian subscriber base is larger than we would have thought.", "You guys have gotten I think almost probably more than a third penetrated of total broadband homes. And it’s I guess interesting to me because it’s a narrower service than the international product which has the star tile.", "So I’m just wondering if you could talk a little bit about how you see the runway still ahead in North America for that product?", "And then when you look at the international business, so leaving Hotstar aside, what does your research tell you about what the company needs to do to drive that business meaningfully higher because to deliver on your ’24 guidance, that’s really probably the biggest key is to get that sub base going.", "So I’m just curious as you look at the plan, what are the things you think really can make that happen?", "Thanks, Ben. So on the Disney+ U.S. side, you mentioned that we’re roughly a third penetrated. We still have some headroom in each one of our major franchises in terms of those viewers, those fans that have expressed interest in subscribing.", "So we are not nearly tapped out on each of the major franchises if someone identifies as a Lucas fan Star Wars or as a Marvel fan or as a Disney fan.", "The biggest opportunity in terms of significance is with general entertainment being added to the service.", "And I think you’ve seen just this quarter, we mentioned that today that we’re adding in Grown-ish, Black-ish and a few other titles into our service.", "I think that will be a trend of us taking more general entertainment and moving it over to Disney+, because as you know, about 50% — slightly over 50% of our consumer base on Disney+ do not have kids.", "It’s a very broad general service, of course, driven by the Disney brand and driven by families, but what we’ve seen time and time again is that the elasticity of Disney and its brand is much greater than we might have given it credit.", "And I think nowhere does this play out more, now getting into the international side of your question, than we see in Europe with the Star brand tile being the sixth brand tile within the Disney+ offering in Europe.", "The other thing though, to your question directly on international that’s going to drive the international business is the predominance of local content that we are developing in order to appeal to the unique taste of each of those international markets.", "And I’ll point out to the 340 productions that we referenced on the last call that we’re developing. And by the way, we just created a new organization within our company to shepherd the development of that content so that we can maximize the chance that we get some global hits, if you will, out of some of that local content.", "And so we’re bullish on the future of Disney+, both domestically and internationally, driven by not only additional prevalence of titles within our major franchises, but also general entertainment and specifically in the international territories local content.", "That’s super helpful, Bob. And just curious, as a follow-up, of those 300 productions or the local originals, will we see a lot of that in fiscal ’22 come on the service?", "Yeah. That’s the slate that comes on I think over the next year and a half, next year and a half to two years.", "So I don’t exactly know the percent that will fall within the context of this year, but we started this initiative about a year ago.", "And I must say, it’s actually extraordinary how great the content is that’s being developed in the international territories.", "Jenn Kettnich — Vice President, Investor Relations", "Thanks, Ben, for the question. Operator, next question please.", "Our next question comes from Michael Nathanson with MoffettNathanson.", "Hey, thanks, Bob. Going on that same part about international Disney+. Can you talk about what role the sports play, maybe even outside of India?", "So what are you seeing in Latin America? Does that help close the gap? And in general, how do you consider maybe loss leading with sports versus pulling back on sports and investing in more of your own content?", "The sports proposition internationally really varies by market. As you know, in Europe, it’s not a big component for us, but in Latin America it actually is.", "And our — the way that we’ve gone to market in each territory, one of the differences between how we go to market in Asia versus how we go to market in Latin America versus how we go to market in Europe is a function of sports.", "That’s a really big piece of it. And where you see like in Latin America where we’ve got a very big percentage of our consumers that are subscribing to our services because of sports, it’s a bigger component to that.", "Sports for us are — it’s a very important strategic offering because the fandom and the passion is so deep.", "If you look at India, we’re certainly going to try to extend our rights on the IPL. But we’re very confident that even if we were not to go ahead and win that auction that we would still be able to achieve our 230 to 260.", "So it’s an important component for us around the world. Obviously really important in India, but not critical to us achieving the 230 to 260 number that we’ve guided to.", "Jenn Kettnich — Vice President, Investor Relations", "Our next question comes from Kannan Venkateshwar with Barclays.", "Thank you. So Bob, if I could just follow-up on that comment on IPL. Hotstar was about 40% of your long-term guide.", "And without cricket, getting to that number seems like a little bit tougher to do, just given the popularity of the sport in the country and also the fact that Hotstar has been in the country for a long time as a localized service.", "So just wanted to see what bridges that gap to your guidance if — in the scenario that you don’t end up getting Hotstar?", "And then beyond that, maybe — sorry, go ahead, Bob.", "So Christine, from a guidance perspective, I guess the other variable is just a breakeven guidance in 2024 for the streaming service, and you did talk about content spend being at least $8 billion to $9 billion in that year last quarter.", "So just given the growth in entertainment content locally around the world as well as some of the investments in sports in Latin America and potentially an increase in cost in India, could you just frame what kind of upside we could see to that content spend budget?", "Any framework in terms of how to think about it would be useful? Thanks.", "Jenn Kettnich — Vice President, Investor Relations", "Bob, do you want to start off on the IPL and Christine can chime in with some more detail on that and the breakeven guidance in content spend?", "Sure, sure. So while the IPL obviously is an important part of the Disney+ Hotstar content offering, it’s really one component of a broader portfolio of entertainment and sports.", "In addition to obviously the original content and the library content from Disney, Pixar, Marvel, Star Wars and NatGeo, our Disney+ Hotstar offering does have a massive collection of local content, and we add over 18,000 hours of original programming every year.", "So while certainly it’s an important component, that local content that we’re developing really will mitigate the impact of us if we were not to win the auction on IPL.", "So an important component, but it’s not like we see that business evaporating if we don’t get it. Christine?", "Christine M. McCarthy — Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Okay. Kannan, on your question on the breakeven guidance and on Disney+ content spend. We’re not updating the guidance.", "We have that fiscal ’24 guidance out in the marketplace and we’re sticking to it. We’re not yet at a steady state of content expense for Disney+, but we expect to have made significant progress by fiscal 2023.", "Jenn Kettnich — Vice President, Investor Relations", "Our next question comes from Jessica Reif Ehrlich with Bank of America Securities.", "Jessica Reif Ehrlich — Bank of America Securities — Analyst", "Thank you. Maybe switching gears to theme parks. The leverage in that business is ginormous as we’ve seen in this quarter.", "Would you consider the 34% operating income margin peak margin? And then just maybe some color because international visitors really haven’t come back, we know they stay longer and spend more.", "Have you gotten all of the technology improvements that you expect? And within that, with some of the changes that you made in the park, it sounds like you’re actually improving capacity.", "So how should we think about capacity now versus what it was prior to COVID?", "Christine M. McCarthy — Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Sure. I would say we’ve been saying this all along through the pandemic where we have taken measures to really look at the cost base and how we’re doing things.", "And there’s been a fundamental shift in some of the operational processes that the parks had used for many, many years and things like the ability to do mobile dining or not having to check in with the human being at a hotel, those kinds of things are all things that add to some upside that we have at the parks.", "And as you mentioned, Jessica, we haven’t yet seen the return of our international guests. And remember, historically, and we always hit this historical boundary of our band of 18% to 22% of our Walt Disney World guests came from outside of the U.S., and they haven’t even yet started to return.", "So I think there’s a lot of things that are boding well. And we saw the performance this quarter of Genie and at the other things like Lightning Lane, but it’s not just that.", "It’s also really compelling offerings in food, beverage, merchandise. And it’s really great to see not only creativity in our content business, but creativity at our parks as well.", "And that’s driving some of that incremental spending that’s certainly helping the margins get to that level that we’ve seen this quarter.", "Jessica Reif Ehrlich — Bank of America Securities — Analyst", "Jenn Kettnich — Vice President, Investor Relations", "All right. Thanks for the question, Jessica. Operator, we’re ready for the next question.", "The next question comes from Brett Feldman with Goldman Sachs.", "Thank you for taking the question. I believe we’re going to be coming up on an anniversary of the first price change that you had for the Disney+ service.", "And so I was hoping you could give us some insight in terms of how you’re thinking about pricing strategy for the product going forward?", "And what are the key things that influence that in terms of timing, when you bring new content on, distribution partners or anything else we should be thinking about as we model out ARPU?", "Christine, I’ll start with this, and if you want to augment, please do. We’ve maintained that we offer an extraordinary price value relationship around the world for Disney+.", "Obviously, the last few years, pretty much the entirety of the launch of Disney+ have been plagued by COVID-related production interruptions.", "Plus in all fairness, our own recognition that we needed to essentially double our production output.", "You put those two things together and we certainly have less content than we want. But as we’ve said over the last few earnings calls, that will rectify itself in the second half of this year.", "We’ve already reached one of our two goals. Our one of the goals was to go ahead and ensure that we had a new title every week, and we’ve achieved that.", "But by ’23, we want to get to a steady state, which is even higher than we have right now. And I think that will give us the impetus to increase that price value relationship even higher and then have the flexibility if we were to so choose to then look at price increases on our service.", "But it’s all about content, content, content and we are bullish about our future content going forward, not only in terms of quality, but also in terms of quantity.", "And that’s really what’s driving our bullishness for what we might see as the pricing power that we would have going forward.", "Christine M. McCarthy — Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Hi, Brett. The only other thing I would add to that is that we are still only less than two and a half years into this business and we’re learning a lot about what consumers are watching, consumption patterns, repeatability and all of those things will factor into when we look at the — as Bob mentioned, the price value equation going forward.", "So as we learn more, we’ll continue to refine the business model. Thank you.", "Jenn Kettnich — Vice President, Investor Relations", "Thanks, Brett, for the question. Operator, next question, please.", "Our next question comes from Doug Mitchelson with Credit Suisse.", "Thanks so much. Good afternoon. I’d echo Ben’s appreciation of the extra streaming details. I guess a couple of questions.", "Latin America was not mentioned. And I know on the last conference call, there was a discussion of working with distributors on Star post-launch to improve traction there.", "Is there any story as to why there was pretty good success here in Europe and Asia Pac, but a little bit less so in Latin America?", "And then, probably for Christine, but on the Direct-to-Consumer programming cost increase that you highlighted for fiscal 2Q, I’m not sure if there’s more context there, but also can we think about the next couple of quarters thereafter to be something in a similar range?", "Certainly, the fourth quarter was already highlighted as a quarter where we’re going to see a lot of fresh original programming.", "Anything that could sort of help us shape out the year on that regard would be helpful? Thank you.", "Jenn Kettnich — Vice President, Investor Relations", "Thanks, Doug, for the question. Bob, do you want to start off on LatAm or international subs, and then Christine, you can add to that.", "Yeah, I will. I’ll talk about LatAm because it kind of goes back a little bit to this live sports story that was questioned earlier.", "We’re actually encouraged by what we see in LatAm, especially given the straight of that live sports calendar and a growing pipeline of local original productions.", "I mean, the reason why we’re doing so many local productions because we know what their power is in those localized markets.", "And we’re also encouraged that we’re seeing a dynamic that we also see in the U.S., which is the vast majority of the sign-ups that came this quarter came from the Combo Plus.", "In other words, it’s the Bundle. And so we’re starting to see LatAm sort of pick up some of the same characteristics that we see in domestic.", "When we started off in LatAm, just like we did with Disney+, it was a little bit slower, but they always seem to keep — kind of a catch-up, if you will.", "And we believe in the strength of our local originals and those 2,000 live sporting events that we program each month.", "Our growing wholesale footprint, you talked about partnerships, that’s an important part, particularly in Latin America, that wholesale footprint and new promotional offers that we are testing in the marketplace.", "So we think that the combination of those things plus our ability to migrate our customers from our linear channels to their digital channels really gives us reason to be fairly bullish in Latin America right now.", "Christine M. McCarthy — Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Hey, Doug. The question on Disney+ programming. We expect to — for the full year spend on content to be — including sports rights to be as much as that $33 billion in total.", "The increase from year-over-year is more spending on our DTC expansion. And this also assumes there is no significant production delays, and things could happen for things other than COVID as well.", "We had a couple of productions that did get delayed for other reasons.", "But when you think about — your comment on our heavy slate of content coming to the service in the fourth quarter is true, but remember, the spending for that is before then.", "So you’ll continue to see increased spending this year. And when you’re looking at that $33 billion, I think it’s also informative to take into account that about a third of that is for sports rights, including the programming and production, but primarily it’s the sports right.", "So if you want to think about the total $33 billion, take out a third for sports and the remainder is for content.", "Not all on Disney+, some of that’s for Hulu as well.", "Jenn Kettnich — Vice President, Investor Relations", "Thanks, Doug, for the question. Operator, next question, please.", "Our next question comes from Michael Morris with Guggenheim.", "Thank you. Good afternoon. I wanted to ask you one about Hulu and just follow-up on the parks. On Hulu, the SVOD ARPU was down a bit year-over-year.", "You guys cited the lower per subscriber ad revenue. I’m hoping you could talk a little bit more about what’s driving that.", "Is engagement down? Is pricing down? I know there’s been some talk of some content that may be coming off the service.", "So if you could expand on that a bit, that would be helpful?", "And then second, I just want to follow-up on the earlier question about capacity at the parks and whether that has expanded through the cycle.", "So I’m just trying to think about the runway given how strong the per caps have been and we can kind of do the math on how much attendance went down and how much you’ve reported, it’s come back.", "But I’m curious if you can give us any more perspective on whether we can exceed or by how much we could exceed those prior attendance levels?", "Jenn Kettnich — Vice President, Investor Relations", "Bob, do you want to start off on parks then Christine can touch on the Hulu SVOD ARPU?", "Okay. I’ll start off on parks. So the issue or the question of capacity at parks is a bit of a complex one because it’s driven by several different dynamics.", "First of all, we’ve got really strong domestic demand, as we’ve said, mitigated a little bit by a lagged return from the international markets.", "Now that in itself is expected because the booking timetable is so long on international trips. So we believe that will come up and enable us to get closer to where we would have been in the past.", "But in terms of sort of the self-management capacity, one of the last things to come back for us in a post-COVID world, what we hope is a post-COVID world, is actually live entertainment because much of the live entertainment is close proximity.", "And we are self-regulating that. We are self-managing that because we don’t want our guests to feel an excessive level of density.", "And the place that you get it is parades and firework shows and things like that. So I suspect that over time we’ll start to regain some of the capacity drop-off that where it’s kind of self-imposing on ourselves.", "The other thing I should say is that, to a certain extent, because people spend such a long time in our parks and resorts, the food and beverage component is actually a pretty big one of those.", "And if there’s — we really haven’t had too big of an issue in terms of retaining and attracting people into our parks — to work into our parks at all.", "As a matter of fact, we had 85% of our cast members pretty much say, yes, immediately, when we ask them back.", "But at the same time, the two areas that have been difficult is hospitality, and right now, we’ve got 90% of our hotels at Walt Disney World open", "and we’ve got all of our hotels at Disneyland open, but also sort of cooks, I think kind of short order cooks.", "And so the capacity constraints, the self-imposed capacity constraints are really a function of our food and beverage sort of mitigation, if you will.", "But the second one is live entertainment, and we’re working towards restoring both of those so that we can get up to something that would be more similar to what we’ve seen in the past in terms of the number of people we put into our parks.", "But I must tell you that our ability to increase our guest experience through a very — a reservation system in a very carefully managed demand ticketing system has been something that we really like.", "And I think guaranteeing our guests that they have a great experience no matter when they come, whether it be the Christmas holiday or whether it be in the middle of the month of September, that’s really important to us.", "And so we’re going to self-manage as to optimize the guest experience. But at the same time, we know we got some headroom, whether it’s due to international", "or whether it’s due to an expansion and reinstatement of things like live entertainment.", "Christine M. McCarthy — Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Great. And Mike, your question on the Hulu SVOD ARPU. Let me just start with advertiser demand because I think this is an important concept.", "It’s incredibly robust for advertising on Hulu. We’re able to use our data. We offer targeted advertising.", "Some people call it addressable. We’ve built a unified ad platform across all of our businesses that do utilize advertising.", "So we’re seeing that as being a growth business for us and are very, very pleased with it.", "On this particular question on the ARPU for Hulu, in the quarter, we benefited growth from some high-impact promotional offers during the quarter on Black Friday, there was one that went into the market.", "Those particular subscribers are showing high rates of engagement. And the conversion of them from the promo to the full price, we’re pretty optimistic of that given their engagement levels.", "So while it was down, you could view it as this was an offering to get people to sample the product. And the — it seems like the product is being certainly appreciated.", "And we’re hoping for those to once again convert to full paid subscribers. Thanks.", "Jenn Kettnich — Vice President, Investor Relations", "Thanks, Mike, for the question. Operator, I think we have time for one more question.", "I just had one long-term question. You guys have done so well over the years in terms of running theme parks world-class and storytelling, as you alluded to.", "The one area where I think Disney has sort of struggled a little bit has been with software development.", "And as you think about sports betting and the metaverse, it just seems like strategically, that’s going to become potentially a more important piece of your core competency going forward.", "Is that sort of top of mind or do you think that’s sort of not a correct way to think about sort of the muscles that you guys need to build over the next five years?", "Jenn Kettnich — Vice President, Investor Relations", "Jason, I think you’re cutting in and out, but I think we got the gist of the question. Bob, do you want to take that one?", "Yeah, yeah. I think I got the gist of it. It is top of mind. It is absolutely top of mind because we realize that in the future, you can call it what you want.", "You want to call it metaverse, you want to call it the blending of the physical and digital experiences, which I think Disney should excel at for all the reasons that you said in your opening.", "We realize that it’s going to be less of a passive type experience where you just have playback whether it’s a sporting event or whether it’s an entertainment offering and more of an interactive lean forward, actively engaged type experience.", "And this is a very top of mind thing for us because we are continuing over time to augment our skills and the types of people that we attract into The Walt Disney Company to reflect the aggressive and ambitious technology agenda that we have.", "You probably noticed that one of my three pillars is innovation and specifically technological innovation because we realize that this is going to be an important part of telling story in that third dimension that lean forward interactive dimension.", "Jenn Kettnich — Vice President, Investor Relations", "Okay.

become a major driver in the growing sales of these lasers.12 In fact, while VCSELs have been used in many applications outside of smartphones—such as data communications, computer mice and automotive lidar systems—smartphones represent a major new opportunity.", "\"It is safe to say that 2017 became the year that VCSELs broke out, driven by consumer applications,\" said John Dexheimer, president

late-2017 completion of a $27 million project to scale up VCSEL production13 capabilities is an indicator that this market is taking off.", "The iPhone 8 is also notable for its purported face recognition capabilities, which is expected to be a boon for the mobile depth sensing market—another application that involves VCSELs.", "Revenues of 3D camera modules are forecast to reach $6 billion in 2022,14 while the opportunities for the lens and illumination components are expected to reach $1.8 billion and $400 million, respectively.", "In November, Lumentum (Milpitas, CA),15 which supplies many of the VCSELs used in the iPhone, announced revenues of $243 million for its first quarter, driven primarily by a ramp-up in its 3D sensing business.", "And with Apple’s new iPhone X and its Face ID feature—based around a VCSEL array projector—it is telling that ams (Premstaetten, Austria) recently became the latest company to reveal plans for a major ramp-up in VCSEL device production,16 following its acquisition of Princeton Optronics (Mercerville, NJ) earlier this year.17", "While these numbers are impressive, they represent the tip of the iceberg for lasers in the consumer space.", "It’s been said before, but it’s worth saying again: lasers are increasingly ubiquitous in our everyday lives, to the point where we often don’t realize it.", "From our daily communications and the design of the products18 we buy to our cars, our homes, our medical care, the grocery store, the golf course,19 a nearby apple orchard20 … they are seemingly everywhere and yet, in many cases, you wouldn’t know they exist.", "In addition to VCSELs, one of the emerging frontrunners in the consumer space for lasers is lidar,21 a market that is projected to double in size22 over the next five years, primarily because of a single emerging application: self-driving vehicles.", "Lidar has been used for years for rangefinders, aerial mapping, 3D scanning of objects and spaces, and aerosol velocity monitoring.", "But autonomous vehicles are expected to turn this multi-billion-dollar market into a multi-trillion-dollar market, with lidar sensors for these vehicles accounting for a larger share of the market than all other lidar applications combined, according to Austin Russell, CEO of start-up lidar company Luminar (Denver, CO).", "In an increasingly competitive space23 (note the acquisition of Princeton Lightwave24 by Ford’s AI unit and General Motors’ purchase of lidar maker Strobe25), Luminar believes its single-laser (1550 nm), single-receiver (InGaAs) lidar sensor, designed and built from the ground up specifically for autonomous vehicles, could be a game-changer.", "The company is partnering with four autonomous vehicle development programs, including the Toyota Research Institute,26 and is leveraging fab infrastructure originally developed for telecommunications lasers to more quickly scale up mass production of its sensors.", "At the end of 2017, Luminar was set to begin a 10,000-unit run out of its 70,000-sq-ft. Orlando, FL facility—an unprecedented number compared to conventional lidar sensor production.", "Looking ahead, two other emerging application areas are worth keeping an eye on: quantum technologies and augmented reality/virtual reality (AR/VR) applications.", "In the quantum space, two key initiatives were announced in 2017: the QUTEGA optical single-ion clock project27 led by Toptica Photonics (Munich, Germany) (lasers are seen as a better alternative for cooling atomic clocks), and a $250 million investment by the UK government28 to convert quantum-physics research into commercial products, with a focus on chip-scale atomic clocks for improved GPS communication, quantum-enabled sensors, quantum communications, and quantum computing.", "And AR/VR is expected to benefit from substantial investment over the next few years—according to IDC,29 total spending on AR/VR is projected to grow from $11.4 billion in 2017 to more than $200 billion in 2021.", "While this is should have primary significance30 for photonic crystals, optoelectronics, and diffractive optics, it could also boost the use of laser materials processing equipment for these products and fuel the integration of more lasers into AR/VR headsets for eye tracking31 and projection32 applications—again, lasers enabling yet more lasers.", "For the first time in our annual laser report, pure industrial laser sales (excluding lithography lasers) topped communications and optical storage laser sales.", "Telecom grew in accordance with bandwidth demand, while experiencing a short-term revenue drop in late 2017—a trend not expected to repeat in 2018.", "All other laser segments experienced growth, especially lasers for aesthetic medical and emerging surgical applications.", "In spite of the political, cultural, and social news bombarding us in 2017, it was a mostly quiet economic year with healthy growth almost slipping by unnoticed.", "In a nutshell, the world’s leading economies turned in a better-than-expected growth rate in 2017, and 2018 is expected to continue this trend.", "As Bloomberg Businessweek put it in a special issue33 on the year ahead, \"The world economy should grow nicely again in 2018.", "Unless someone does something dumb.\" This sums it up, allowing us to focus in on the world markets for industrial laser material processing.", "Industrial laser activity experienced another growth year led by strong double-digit sales of high-power fiber lasers, a surge in excimer laser revenues led by laser processing of silicon of displays, and significant increases for ultrafast pulse lasers.", "This growth came at the expense of CO2 laser sales (down 14%) while solid-state (disk) spurted to an 18% growth.", "High-power direct diode and excimer lasers in the ‘Other’ category gained 56%, with excimer lasers continuing strong short-term gains based on their use in smartphone processing applications.", "Includes lasers used for all types of metal processing (welding, cutting, annealing, drilling); semiconductor and microelectronics manufacturing (lithography, scribing, defect repair, via drilling); marking of all materials; and other materials processing (such as cutting and welding organics, rapid prototyping, micromachining, and grating manufacture).", "While political problems continued to worsen around much of the world in 2017, and North Korea threatened to launch nuclear missiles at its enemies, the materials processing laser segment let none of this negative news dampen its party.", "In fact, from summer 2016 to Q3 2017 when this was written, laser revenue growth was nothing short of phenomenal.", "Geographically, China remained strong as usual, but Europe and other most other Asian countries were strong in laser materials processing revenues as well.", "North America was not as strong as some of these other regions, but did a respectable showing nevertheless.", "Japan was the only country with shrinking laser markets during the period.", "Higher-power fiber lasers were a big part of the growth driver in materials processing. Excimer lasers for lithography had a fairly strong 2017, and revenues for lasers used to produce flat-panel displays were pushed to record levels; unfortunately, not enough manufacturing lasers could be produced to prevent shortages of the OLED screens on the new iPhone X. Additive manufacturing had a slow start in 2017, but by mid-2017, a series of large orders more than made up for the slow months.", "Industrial laser revenues saw continued growth in the automotive, aerospace, energy, electronics, and communications sectors.", "Marking contributed about 15% of all laser revenues, with growth dominated by fiber lasers. Micro, which includes all applications using lasers with <500 W of power, climbed to 32% of the total laser market, thanks to a 56% growth in the sector that included display applications requiring excimer lasers.", "Among Macro revenues, cutting is the most important application in terms of revenue generated (66%). In 2017, cutting expanded by 29%—a level the industry says will not be matched in 2018.", "In the Micro sector, additive manufacturing—more specifically laser additive manufacturing (LAM) for metal deposition and prototyping—grew 30% in 2017, spurred by acceptance in the aviation engine industry, which is using both intermediate and high-power CO2 and fiber lasers.", "Economic projections for manufacturing in 2018 are a repeat of 2017 with pockets of sluggishness (East Asia, South America, and Eastern Europe) continuing.", "For industrial lasers in 2018, 7% revenue growth is projected because of a calming of the growth spurt in high-power fiber and excimer lasers over the past two years.", "Marking laser revenues are expected to show a decline (to 6% growth) as unit prices continue to erode.", "Micro laser revenue will grow 9% as fine blanking and non-metal processing grow in importance.

One can assume that people driven by hedonistic and obsessive motivations would seek instant gratification and would probably binge-watch as soon as this activity becomes available [4,37].", "Another motivation for binge-watching is of a social nature. People binge-watch to make social connections, to become part of the group or the fandom, to feel accepted by their peers [20,31].", "Moreover, studies conducted by Shim and Kim [34] show that people tend to have more motivation to binge-watch a TV series if it is recommended by others.", "It seems important to mention that the results obtained by Conlin, Billings, and Averset [44] emphasise the statistically significant relation between FOMO (fear of missing out) and the binge-watching phenomenon.", "Results show that increased FOMO was a significant predictor for binge-watching especially dramatic series to “catch up” with the narrative and join the cultural conversation.", "Scientists emphasise that people binge-watch new TV series as soon as possible because they do not want to be ostracised in future conversations with others.", "Moreover, the authors indicate that high FOMO makes people binge-watch TV shows to avoid spoilers, which could potentially decrease the enjoyment of a series.", "Furthermore, the results obtained by Panda and Pandey [31] imply that social engagement, escape, influence of advertising, and accessibility are the main motives behind the intention to spend more time binge-watching.", "Surprisingly, the scientists indicate that people who experience negative gratification and feel anxious or nervous after a binge-watching session are more likely to spend more time doing it, thus becoming increasingly addicted to this behaviour.", "Schweidel and Moe [47] also emphasise the effect of engagement in such behaviour on the amount of time spend on binge-watching.", "Obtained results imply that people who tend to highly engage in binge-watching display a tendency to watch additional episodes of the same series and are more prone to consuming more episodes over a given period of time.", "Such individuals tend to spend more time watching TV series and are highly inclined to quickly beginning the next session.", "However, exposure to advertisements during a binge-watching session discouraged people from viewing further on.", "Moreover, there is a significant relation between binge-watching and compensatory motivations, where binge-watching becomes a way to escape reality and avoid problems or negative emotions [19,20,31,39].", "Panda and Pandey [31] imply that people tend to binge-watch more to escape reality, which can lead to decrease of other, more adaptive way of coping with negative emotions.", "Furthermore, study implies there is a significant correlation between binge-watching and motivation to deal with loneliness, thus TV series or fictional characters become viewer’s companions in solitude", "[20].

These findings are covered by this systematic review due to the novelty of the research subject and dearth in the literature.", "Furthermore, some individuals are characterised by self-development and cognitive motivation to gain information or knowledge by watching TV series [20,34,37].", "Pittman and Steiner [42] claim that people who binge-watch are more neurotic, less agreeable, less conscientious, and less open to new experience.", "These conclusions have been confirmed in the research by Govaert [28] and Tóth-Király, Tóth-Fáber, Hága, and Gábor [37].", "It can be assumed that people who display a tendency to excessive binge-watching can be more prone to feeling negative emotions, such as sadness or anxiety, may have low tolerance for stressful situations, low self-esteem, and inclination to self-criticism.", "These factors are usually predictors of internet and computer addiction [49]. Research also shows that problematic binge-watchers are characterised by low conscientiousness, which can be related to low academic achievements, procrastination, and duty avoidance, but also that binge-watchers cope with stress using avoidance and emotional coping, instead of task-oriented coping [28,36,41].", "Other studies imply that, besides high neuroticism and low conscientiousness, impulsivity and lack of self-control are further statistically significant predictors of problematic binge-watching [18,19,28,30].", "Riddle et al.

An individual may decide to act impulsively in response to both positive and negative emotions.", "It can be assumed that binge-watching is used to deal with aversive emotions such as sadness or anxiety as well as to enhance positive emotions and attain instant gratification.", "In the literature, such a tendency has been marked as a risk factor of maladaptive strategies of emotional regulation characteristic of behavioural addictions [19,21].", "Further personality traits that may be significant for enhanced understanding of binge-watching are sensation-seeking [34].", "The results obtained by Flayelle et al. [30] show that individuals with a high level of sensation-seeking can be prone to excessive TV viewing because of the constant search for arousing and exciting stimuli.", "It can be assumed that people who display high impulsivity, urgency, and sensation seeking may be more prone to the addictive nature of TV series binge-watching [18,19,30].", "Additionally, the need for cognition, understood as an individual’s inclination to engaging in elaborated thinking, has proved to be significant for the binge-watching tendency [34].", "Watching multiple episodes of TV series seems to require a high level of cognitive resources. Shim and Kim", "[34] imply that individuals with a higher need for cognition tend to engage in the binge-watching behaviour more frequently than people with a low need of cognition.", "On the other hand, Conlin [4] has emphasised that transportability, i.e., the ability to experience immersion into the narrative, is one of the most significant predictors of binge-watching.", "Results of this study also suggest that another personality trait characteristic of people who display the tendency toward binge-watching is fantasy empathy, described as the ability to feel the emotions of fictional characters, being one of the predictors of character identification and transportation into the narrative.", "The research conducted by Flayelle et al.

They also consider their mode of binge-watching as problematic and have reported more problematic internet use and alcohol-related problems.", "On the other hand, the regulated binge-watchers are motivated by emotional enhancement and characterised by low emotional reactivity and are not impulsive.", "Furthermore, the research conducted by Starosta, Izydorczyk, and Lizińczyk [20] also indicates that the motivation for escaping from daily life problems and coping with loneliness are most characteristic of the individuals whose binge-watching proves to be problematic.", "The results of this research also imply a high correlation between the motivation for escape and emotional regulation.", "It seems understandable that people who binge-watch excessively may use this behaviour as a form of emotional regulation.", "Similar conclusions have also been formulated in other studies [18,19,21,31].", "The major risk behind the excessive binge-watching behaviour is the probability of developing symptoms of behavioural addiction.", "Multiple studies show that using binge-watching to obtain instant gratification and to regulate emotions is a maladaptive coping strategy characteristic of behavioural addictions such as problematic internet/computer use, gambling, and social media addiction [18,19,30,31].", "The motivations driving problematic binge-watchers are the urge to escape from reality, dealing with loneliness, habit, or passing the time [20,31,40].", "The research conducted by Merill and Rubenking [36] also indicates a statistically significant relation between binge-watching and procrastination.", "The results of the study imply that reward motivation and high tendency to procrastination positively predicts high frequency of binge-watching.", "Moreover, excessive binge-watchers display other symptoms of behavioural addiction, such as loss of self-control, urgency, regret, neglect of duties, negative social and health consequences, lying, or even symptoms of withdrawal such as anxiety, nervousness, rage, and concentration difficulties [18,19,20,30].", "Numerous surveys imply that binge-watching may entail a sacrifice of some part of the viewer’s life and may become the main source of entertainment and positive affect", "[31]. It is also connected with the feeling of regret or guilt, especially if the binge-watching sessions are usually unplanned and uncontrolled [18,22].", "Further research results highlight that binge-watchers can automatically anticipate regret and goal conflict", "[36,38].

It can be a very positive and highly exciting experience; however, it is important to remember that the said immersive character of binge-watching can also be conducive to the risk of addiction.", "Furthermore, the Uses and Gratification Theory emphasises that using new technologies, including binge-watching, can be a very entertaining activity that caters to an individual’s specific needs [19,20,30,42,71].", "Most of the studies covered by the systematic research addressed in this paper were conducted in the USA (n = 16) or in European countries (n = 10), including Belgium (n = 3), the Netherlands (n = 2), Poland (n = 1), Portugal (n = 1), the United Kingdom (n = 1), Germany (n = 1), and Hungary (n = 1).", "This seems perfectly understandable since binge-watching was popularised by an American company—Netflix.", "However, Netflix and other streaming platforms are currently available in most countries around the world, which is why it is also important that more research on the behavioural patterns and psychological conditions of binge-watching be conducted on different populations worldwide.", "Secondly, women constitute the majority of those surveyed under most of the studies referred to in this paper, which is why it may be assumed that women binge-watch more than men [20,32].", "However, it is important to emphasise that, compared to men, women also seem to have been more willing to participate in the surveys.", "In further research, it would be important to examine the male population in greater detail in order to explore the binge-watching behaviour patterns typical of men and to compare them with women.", "Another limitation of the research is that most participants of the studies covered by this systematic review were in their twenties.", "It can be explained by the fact that young adults are the main consumers of streaming platforms and that most of the surveys were conducted online.", "It can be assumed that young adults seem to be the most accessible research group. Furthermore, this could be related to the fact that the majority of the research participants were students.", "Undergraduates are by far the most accessible research group, and one may also assume that they simply have enough time to binge-watch numerous TV shows.", "However, it is important not to generalise about the results obtained by studying only the group of students among the entire population.", "With regard to the foregoing, it seems important to conduct more research involving people of different age groups as well, including adolescents, middle-aged people, and seniors, as well as people of diverse professional status.", "Another limitation to the research is the lack of randomised and longitudinal studies on the psychological conditions of binge-watching, which would be characterised by utmost validity and reliability.", "The current research on the relation between excessive binge-watching and mental disorders, such as depression, anxiety, and insomnia, presents inconsistent results.", "Furthermore, one must face the difficulty in establishing the direction inherent in these interrelations.", "The research focused on the subject of video games and internet addiction also highlights the problem of determining whether these excessive behaviour patterns are predictors or effects of mental disorder [70].", "There is a need for further research on the nature of the relation between mental disorders and binge-watching.", "The last limitation of the studies addressed in the paper is the lack of consensus on how to define binge-watching.", "A proper definition of this construct would be more than welcome. Some research concerning the fast-developing psychosocial phenomena such as binge-watching as well as its psychological and social conditions, the population diversity in terms of age, nationality, and professional status could lead to better understanding of this behaviour.", "It would also prove helpful in identifying the differences between “normal”, i.e., highly entertaining and healthy binge-watching, and excessive and compulsive binge-watching, bearing the symptoms of behavioural addiction.", "To summarise the foregoing elaborations, binge-watching can be both harmonious and highly entertaining as well as an obsessive and compensatory behaviour.", "People are driven by multiple motivations for binge-watching, including those of a social and cognitive nature, by transportation into the narrative, or willingness to pass the time, but also to escape daily life problems, to regulate negative emotions, and to gain instant gratification.", "The research implies that, particularly, the excessive forms of binge-watching can involve symptoms of addiction, such as lack of control, negative health and social effects, feeling of guilt, and neglect of duties.", "Flayelle et al. [3] have emphasised that it is important to distinguish the healthy way of consuming TV series from the problematic and excessive forms of binge-watching.", "In consideration of all the foregoing reasons, i.e., the risk of negative outcomes of excessive binge-watching, the increasing popularity of the phenomenon, especially among young people, and the similarities with other behavioural addictions, it seems important to continue the research on both unproblematic and problematic binge-watching, as well as on the relation between this activity and mental disorders.", "Further studies addressing diverse population groups would also prove helpful for better understanding of this phenomenon and could potentially lead to improved prevention and therapeutic care.", "Conceptualization, methodology, writing—review and editing—J.A.S. and B.I.; investigation, writing—original draft preparation, resources, visualisation—J.A.S.; supervision and project administration—B.I.", "All the authors have read and agreed to the published version of the manuscript.", "- 1.Netflix Netflix Declares Binge Watching is the New Normal.

Basic statistical software, such as Microsoft Excel or data visualization tools, such as Google Charts and Tableau, can help parse data, identify trends and relationships between variables, and visually display information.", "Descriptive analytics is especially useful for communicating change over time and uses trends as a springboard for further analysis to drive decision-making.", "Here are five examples of descriptive analytics in action to apply at your organization.", "Related: 5 Business Analytics Skills for Professionals", "One example of descriptive analytics is reporting. If your organization tracks engagement in the form of social media analytics or web traffic, you’re already using descriptive analytics.", "These reports are created by taking raw data—generated when users interact with your website, advertisements, or social media content—and using it to compare current metrics to historical metrics and visualize trends.", "For example, you may be responsible for reporting on which media channels drive the most traffic to the product page of your company’s website.", "Using descriptive analytics, you can analyze the page’s traffic data to determine the number of users from each source.", "You may decide to take it one step further and compare traffic source data to historical data from the same sources.", "This can enable you to update your team on movement; for instance, highlighting that traffic from paid advertisements increased 20 percent year over year.", "The three other analytics types can then be used to determine why traffic from each source increased or decreased over time, if trends are predicted to continue, and what your team’s best course of action is moving forward.", "Another example of descriptive analytics that may be familiar to you is financial statement analysis.", "Financial statements are periodic reports that detail financial information about a business and, together, give a holistic view of a company’s financial health.", "There are several types of financial statements, including the balance sheet, income statement, cash flow statement, and statement of shareholders’ equity.", "Each caters to a specific audience and conveys different information about a company’s finances.", "Financial statement analysis can be done in three primary ways: vertical, horizontal, and ratio.", "Vertical analysis involves reading a statement from top to bottom and comparing each item to those above and below it.", "This helps determine relationships between variables. For instance, if each line item is a percentage of the total, comparing them can provide insight into which are taking up larger and smaller percentages of the whole.", "Horizontal analysis involves reading a statement from left to right and comparing each item to itself from a previous period.", "Finally, ratio analysis involves comparing one section of a report to another based on their relationships to the whole.", "This directly compares items across periods, as well as your company’s ratios to the industry’s to gauge whether yours is over- or underperforming.", "Each of these financial statement analysis methods are examples of descriptive analytics, as they provide information about trends and relationships between variables based on current and historical data.", "Descriptive analytics can also be used to identify trends in customer preference and behavior and make assumptions about the demand for specific products or services.", "Streaming provider Netflix’s trend identification provides an excellent use case for descriptive analytics.", "Netflix’s team—which has a track record of being heavily data-driven—gathers data on users’ in-platform behavior.", "They analyze this data to determine which TV series and movies are trending at any given time and list trending titles in a section of the platform’s home screen.", "Not only does this data allow Netflix users to see what’s popular—and thus, what they might enjoy watching—but it allows the Netflix team to know which types of media, themes, and actors are especially favored at a certain time.", "This can drive decision-making about future original content creation, contracts with existing production companies, marketing, and retargeting campaigns.", "Descriptive analytics is also useful in market research. When it comes time to glean insights from survey and focus group data, descriptive analytics can help identify relationships between variables and trends.", "For instance, you may conduct a survey and identify that as respondents’ age increases, so does their likelihood to purchase your product.", "If you’ve conducted this survey multiple times over several years, descriptive analytics can tell you if this age-purchase correlation has always existed or if it was something that only occurred this year.", "Insights like this can pave the way for diagnostic analytics to explain why certain factors are correlated.", "You can then leverage predictive and prescriptive analytics to plan future product improvements or marketing campaigns based on those trends.", "Finally, descriptive analytics can be applied to track progress to goals. Reporting on progress toward key performance indicators (KPIs) can help your team understand if efforts are on track or if adjustments need to be made.", "For example, if your organization aims to reach 500,000 monthly unique page views, you can use traffic data to communicate how you’re tracking toward it.", "Perhaps halfway through the month, you’re at 200,000 unique page views. This would be underperforming because you’d like to be halfway to your goal at that point—at 250,000 unique page views.", "This descriptive analysis of your team’s progress can allow further analysis to examine what can be done differently to improve traffic numbers and get back on track to hit your KPI.", "“Never before has so much data about so many different things been collected and stored every second of every day,” says Harvard Business School Professor Jan Hammond in the online course Business Analytics.", "“In this world of big data, data literacy—the ability to analyze, interpret, and even question data—is an increasingly valuable skill.”", "Leveraging descriptive analytics to communicate change based on current and historical data and as a foundation for diagnostic, predictive, and prescriptive analytics has the potential to take you and your organization far.", "Do you want to become a data-driven professional?
