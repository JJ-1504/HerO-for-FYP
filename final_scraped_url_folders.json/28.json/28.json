a use which the FDA had never approved and which the FDA subsequently determined caused an increased risk of death.", "In particular, in 2007, the FDA mandated that a “black box” label be added to Aranesp’s label, warning that Aranesp “increased the risk of death . . .", "in patients with active malignant disease [cancer] receiving neither chemotherapy nor radiation.” At approximately the time that the FDA issued the black box warning, Amgen ceased its promotion of Aranesp for the treatment of anemia caused by cancer rather than the cancer’s treatment.", "Amgen’s internal sales and marketing materials made plain that Amgen’s misbranding of Aranesp was the company’s core business strategy to gain market share from its only ESA competitor, Procrit, sold by Johnson & Johnson.", "At the time of Aranesp’s 2002 launch, doctors typically prescribed Procrit to treat the anemic patient populations for which Aranesp was approved.", "To compete with Procrit, Amgen built the Aranesp commercial strategy around the unapproved, off-label approach of a less frequent dosing schedule, which Amgen sales representatives argued was more convenient for patients and more profitable for doctors.", "Amgen implemented this illegal commercial effort through its promotion of off-label doses from two to four times larger than those approved by the FDA, administered far less frequently than approved by the FDA.", "When this unapproved, off-label dosing effort proved commercially successful, Amgen sales and marketing executives determined that capturing the population of anemic cancer patients who were not undergoing chemotherapy was “the next big thing” and would give Amgen a “51 percent [ESA] market share.”", "Accordingly, the company set about capturing the off-label market of patients suffering from anemia caused by cancer itself, rather than anemia caused by chemotherapy, and its sales representatives began marketing the safety and efficacy of Aranesp in that population.", "Ultimately, in 2007, the FDA determined that Aranesp increased the risk of death in that very population.", "Aware that its misbranding of Aranesp was illegal, Amgen instructed its sales representatives to promote off-label uses through the guise of “reactive marketing.”", "This technique attempted to circumvent the law by inducing doctors to ask questions about an off-label use, to serve as a smokescreen to hide Amgen’s intentional effort to introduce the drug for unapproved, “off-label” uses.", "Amgen thus trained its sales representatives to intentionally elicit questions from doctors about off-label uses as legal cover to then provide the doctors with studies supporting the off-label use, thereby promoting the drug for that unapproved use.", "The studies Amgen provided to doctors to support off-label uses were often the very same studies that the FDA had rejected as insufficient to support the safety and efficacy of those off-label uses, when Amgen had applied to expand Aranesp’s label to encompass them.", "The $612 million dollar civil settlement encompasses broader allegations by the United States against Amgen than those contained in the Information.", "The civil settlement agreement resolves claims contained in ten lawsuits against Amgen that were brought under the qui tam, or whistle-blower, provisions of the False Claims Act, which allow private citizens to bring civil actions on behalf of the United States and share in any recovery.", "Seven of these cases currently are pending in the Eastern District of New York; two are pending in the District of Massachusetts and one in the Western District of Washington.", "The ten cases are: United States ex rel.

intervention to regulate drug prices or otherwise control their rapid increase.2", "But any intervention should be predicated on a clear understanding of the economic forces that drive price increases, and the parties responsible for them.", "Much attention has focused on the average wholesale or “list” price set by manufacturers prior to discounts.", "These prices have been increasing—the average list price of branded drugs rose 12.4% in 2015, and has increased 10% or more annually since 2012.3 Yet list prices rarely represent what manufacturers are paid for drugs, as they are routinely discounted and rebates paid to various parties in the distribution system.", "Net prices—which include all discounts and rebates—have also risen, albeit more slowly to 2.8% in 2015.3 Yet even the net price that manufacturers receive does not fully represent what patients pay (through a combination of out-of-pocket payments and insurer reimbursements).", "The difference between what patients pay and what manufacturers receive is allocated among other stakeholders in the drug distribution chain, including insurers, pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs), pharmacies, and wholesalers.", "Contracts among these players govern the exchange of goods (drugs) or services (such as logistics or claims administration) for various fees, discounts, rebates, and chargebacks.", "Such arrangements are typically privately negotiated and undisclosed, making it difficult to determine precisely how these payments are distributed.", "However, publicly traded companies in the distribution system must disclose annual financial information to the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and other regulatory agencies, and from those data we can examine the flow of funds from the insurer back to the manufacturer, and the relative profitability at each step.", "The results illuminate opportunities to reduce total drug spending.", "We estimated the flow of funds in the distribution system by first developing a conceptual framework to illustrate the flow of goods, services, and funds among system participants.", "Next, we used data from financial statements, regulatory filings and other sources to estimate the average gross and net profit margins of companies along the distribution system.", "We applied these estimates to calculate the proportion of funds retained at each step in the process, and used them to illustrate how $100 in retail prescription drug expenditures is allocated across players in the distribution system.", "Using information from four published sources, we developed a conceptual framework of pharmaceuticals distributed in retail settings, illustrated in Figure 1.4-7", "Beneficiaries and sponsors pay premiums to a health plan, in exchange for drug coverage benefits for plan members.", "The health plan or self-insured employer contracts with a PBM to manage the plan’s drug benefit in exchange for fees and payments.", "The PBM negotiates with drug manufacturers to provide preferred formulary placement for the manufacturers’ products, in exchange for discounts from list price, rebates, incentives and other fees payable to the PBM.", "The PBM also negotiates contracts with pharmacies, including those in its network, to set reimbursements for the drugs dispensed by the pharmacy.", "Pharmacies in turn negotiate agreements with drug wholesalers, setting the wholesale rates at which they obtain the drugs, and wholesalers negotiate to buy drugs from manufacturers and distribute them to pharmacies.", "When a covered beneficiary fills a prescription at a retail pharmacy, the pharmacy collects the beneficiary’s copayment or coinsurance and dispenses the drug from inventory.", "The pharmacy passes the copayment to the PBM, and the PBM pays the pharmacy the negotiated reimbursement.", "To re-stock inventory, the pharmacy purchases drugs from the wholesaler, who purchases them from the manufacturers.", "Periodically (e.g. quarterly), the PBM reconciles drug claims and the manufacturer pays the PBM any rebates, incentive payments or fees owed based on their negotiated contracts.", "The PBM may pass some of these funds on to the plan sponsors, according to the contracts negotiated with each plan.", "We collected data on the largest public companies for each sector described in Figure 1: insurers, PBMs, pharmacies, wholesalers and manufacturers.", "We used public sources to identify the largest publicly traded companies in each sector until at least half of the total market was represented.3,8-13 For health insurers, our sample only accounts for 48% of the premiums written, because many large insurers are private, not for profit, or mutual.", "Table 1 lists the included companies and their respective market shares.", "Our objective was to estimate average gross and net profit margins for each sector in the distribution system described in Figure 1, and use them to calculate the proportion of the aggregate flow of funds captured by each sector.", "In this distribution system, each sector supplies goods or services to customers in exchange for payment (revenue).", "Some of that revenue is in turn passed from the original supplier to the next player in the chain, as payment for the raw goods and services needed to produce the product, called “cost of goods sold.”", "The remaining funds, or gross profit, are captured in the sector, and may be used in several ways, including to fund research and development (R&D), marketing, general and administrative activities (SG&A), or provide a return to owners (net earnings or profits).", "A company’s gross profits are the difference between revenues received and costs of goods sold; gross margin is this amount expressed as a percent of revenues.", "For example, gross profits for wholesalers are revenues received primarily from pharmacies less payments made primarily to manufacturers.", "Some of these gross profits are spent on other business expenses such as marketing, R&D, depreciation, interest, and taxes.", "What remains after subtracting these expenses is net profits, which accrue to the shareholder owners of the firm.", "We estimated gross and net margins as a fraction of net revenues for all companies using information from their 2015 SEC filings (forms 10K and 20F).", "To the extent that SEC filings allowed, we isolated financial data for US pharmaceutical operations and for the sector of interest.", "For example, for a company with both specialty pharmacy and PBM divisions that report separate financial results for each, we used PBM division data to estimate margins for the PBM business.", "In some cases, it was not possible to isolate the results of pharmaceutical business activities—for example, health insurers do not report financial results for their pharmaceutical claims activity separate from medical claims activity.", "In these cases, our margin estimates include activities of other types of business. When data did not permit a US-specific margin to be calculated, we used the global margin.", "We also calculated separate gross margins for branded and generic drugs for each sector. For manufacturers, we categorized each company as either a branded or generic producer, and calculated separate gross and net margins for each.13 For pharmacies, we used the National Average Drug Acquisition Cost (NADAC) and the National Average Retail Price (NARP) datasets from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) for 2013, and calculated gross margins as described in Appendix Section B, analyzing generic and branded subsamples separately.", "The SEC filings of wholesalers and insurers do not report results of generic and branded activity separately, so we could not estimate drug-type specific margins for them.", "Instead, we used other published estimates of gross margins specific to brand and generic drugs.14,15", "To illustrate the implications of our estimates, we explore a hypothetical scenario in which $100 is spent on prescription drugs acquired at a retail pharmacy using commercial insurance.", "We apply the average sector gross margins to the incoming funds to each sector to identify how much is retained in each sector, and apply the average sector net margins to identify the funds that are kept as net profits.", "This process was applied throughout the distribution system, as detailed in Section D of the Appendix.", "The funds passed through the last step are assumed to be production costs to manufacture the drugs.", "The first step in the chain requires further explanation. Of a $100 expenditure on prescription drugs obtained at a retail pharmacy, some portion is paid out-of-pocket by the patient, in the form of copayments and co-insurance, and goes directly to the PBM.d", "The remaining funds originate with the insurer as premium revenue, and the insurer’s gross margin is applied to this amount, rather than the full $100, to calculate the amount retained in the insurance sector.", "The proportion of total drug expenditures originating as premiums was estimated using data from the 2014 Medical Expenditure Panel Survey (MEPS), which provides annual total prescription drug expenditures and out-of-pocket payments (see Appendix Section C for detail).", "For all other sectors, all funds flowing into the sector are assumed to come directly from the sector immediately upstream—that is, all manufacturers’ revenue is passed through from wholesalers, all wholesalers’ revenue is passed through from pharmacies, etc.", "Finally, we compare the average net margins estimated for pharmaceutical distribution system participants to the average net margins of public companies in similar industries, which are published annually.16 Drug manufacturers are compared to other consumer and business product manufacturers, drug wholesalers are compared to food wholesalers, health insurers to other types of insurance companies, and pharmacies to other retail businesses.", "PBMs are compared to the category of real estate operations and services, which includes real estate agents and brokers, who also negotiate and act as intermediaries in transactions between third parties.", "Average US sales-weighted gross and net margins for each sector in the distribution system are reported in Table 2, as are gross margins for the branded and generic markets separately.", "For all drugs combined, gross margins are highest for manufacturers at 71.1%, followed by insurers (22.2%), pharmacies (20.1%), PBMs (6.3%) and wholesalers (3.7%).", "Net margins are significantly lower for all parties, ranging from 26.3% for manufacturers to 0.5% for wholesalers.", "In the branded market, gross margins are higher for manufacturers (76.3%) and lower for the other distribution system parties (except for insurers, for whom drug-type-specific margins could not be estimated), while in the generic drug market, the opposite is true: margins are lower for manufacturers (49.8%), and higher for all other distribution system participants (again, excepting insurers), including pharmacies, with generic gross margins of 42.7%.", "Net margins by drug type are only available for manufacturers, falling significantly below their gross margins, at 28.1% for brand drugs and 18.2% for generics.", "Figure 2 applies the gross and net margin estimates in Table 2 to illustrate the average flows of funds to distribution system participants for branded and generic drugs combined Of a $100 expenditure on pharmaceuticals by consumers (composed of both out-of-pocket and insurer payment), roughly $17 goes to drug production costs, $41 accrues to the manufacturers (a third of which is net profit), and $19 accrues to insurers ($3 of which is net profit).", "PBMs keep about $5 ($2 net profit), pharmacies keep $15 ($3 net profit), and wholesalers keep about $2 (30 cents net profit).", "Total net profit on a $100 expenditure is $23, of which $15 is captured by manufacturers and the remaining $8 by intermediaries.", "Figure 3 shows the results of similar analyses conducted separately for branded (Panel A) and generic (Panel B) drugs, and demonstrates important differences in how funds accrue to distribution system players across these market segments.", "While manufacturers make about three times the gross profits on branded vs. generic drugs ($58 vs. $18, consistent with the market exclusivity granted to patented drugs), other segments make much more on generic expenditures: PBMs make four times as much on generic drugs compared to brands, while wholesalers make eleven times as much, and pharmacies almost twelve times as much, $32 compared to $3.", "Figure 4 compares the net margins for players in the pharmaceutical distribution system to those in similar industries, based on published estimates of average net margins for 100+ industries.16 Drug manufacturers and pharmacies had higher margins than most comparator industries.", "Margins for all participants were validated with previously published estimates whenever possible. See Appendix Section B for more details.", "Given large and increasing expenditures for pharmaceutical drugs in the US, an understanding of who profits from this spending—and by how much—is of great policy salience.", "Identifying these flows is challenging because available data are highly aggregated and permit only a high-level view of a complex distribution system.", "Despite these limitations, we argue the aggregate picture can illuminate features of the distribution system and guide further inquiry.", "We demonstrate that gross and net margins vary widely across distribution sectors, prompting the question whether companies are making excessive returns.", "Market concentration is an important indicator of companies’ ability to earn extraordinary returns, and several segments in the US pharmaceutical distribution system are highly concentrated.", "The top three PBMs, wholesalers and retailers account for 85%, 66% and 49% of their markets, respectively.", "Barriers to entry are another source of market power, and Joseph Stiglitz has argued that “[t]oday’s markets are characterized by the persistence of high monopoly profits,” citing pharmaceutical manufacturing as one example.17", "This market power manifests in practices that might raise consumer prices. For example, pharmacies charge widely varying prices for exactly the same product, and the uninsured often pay higher prices than insured consumers.18 Some players claim market concentration is good for consumers.", "For example, PBMs argue that their large size gives them bargaining power to negotiate lower prices for their clients.19,20 Less clear is the extent to which these savings are passed on to health plans and consumers.", "PBMs carefully guard information about the size of negotiated rebates and discounts, which may enhance their ability to negotiate lower prices, but also masks whether they are indeed lowering the prices paid by patients and insurers as claimed.", "In fact, recently proposed legislation intended to lower drug prices would require PBMs to disclose rebates and the share passed on to health plans.21", "While the market for manufacturers is less concentrated, patents and market exclusivity for many products confer a complete monopoly for those drugs.", "Brand manufacturers’ net profit margins fall at the upper end of the distribution for manufacturing industries, suggesting excessive returns.", "Estimated net margins for the other distribution system segments except pharmacies are comparable to those of similar non-pharma industries.", "However, returns for manufacturers, particularly branded drugs, must compensate for the risk taken in drug development.", "Other manufacturing industries where intellectual property protections are important, including software, semiconductors, and computer equipment also demonstrate higher margins.", "Nonetheless, manufacturers also engage in some questionable practices. Manufacturers of branded drugs facing competition from new generic entrants may fund copay assistance programs that reduce patients’ out-of-pocket costs, dissuading them from switching to cheaper generics and circumventing insurer formularies designed to encourage such switching.22 Manufacturers have also been scrutinized for off-label promotion of drugs and anticompetitive pricing practices, including the ongoing investigation surrounding rising insulin prices.23", "Finally, insurer practices also have competing effects on consumer drug costs. On one hand, they exert downward pressure on prices when they place the products of manufacturers who refuse to lower prices in higher cost-sharing or copayment tiers.", "But the resulting high out-of-pocket costs burden consumers who need these expensive drugs, and lower adherence.", "The practice also doubly penalizes those who do not respond to less expensive therapies.24", "Sometimes consumers pay more for a prescription than the insurer’s cost of acquiring the drug—a common experience in high deductible health plans.", "Members who have not exhausted their deductible pay out-of-pocket the full average wholesale 8 price for drugs, although the plan acquires them at a discount and collects the associated manufacturer rebate.25 For generic drugs, consumers’ copays may exceed the cost of the drug.", "By contrast, patients would not likely tolerate paying an office visit copayment that exceeded their physician’s reimbursement.", "In summary, we find that more than $1 in every $5 in spending on prescription drugs goes towards profits of firms in the pharmaceutical distribution system.", "While the current analysis cannot say definitively whether any sectors are making excessive profits, our results are consistent with profit-making behavior on the part of all sectors.", "Greater scrutiny of their pricing policies and more competition throughout the distribution system is warranted.", "The question of what drives high intermediary profits on generic products is especially interesting.", "This work has several limitations, many resulting from data shortcomings. Key data are not always publicly available, and even the data presented in financial statements may be reported in inconsistent and opaque ways.26 Some of the largest players in certain sectors are privately held and make no financial data public.", "Thus, all our estimates are to some extent incomplete and inexact.", "Also, this analysis shows an aggregated picture of the retail pharmaceutical distribution system. It does not represent the flow of funds for any particular drug or firm, and indeed, those pictures may vary across settings and from that presented here.", "An important category that is not well characterized here is that of specialty drugs, such as biologics for rheumatoid arthritis or expensive HIV therapies.", "Some manufacturer and insurer margin estimates here may include specialty drugs, but they are generally not distributed through retail pharmacies.", "Instead, they are handled through specialty pharmacies, the largest of which are owned by PBMs. Physician administered specialty drugs often add another player to the distribution system, the group purchasing organization, which negotiates on behalf of hospitals and physicians for volume discounts.", "Any policy effort to control drug prices through regulation or other means would benefit from greater transparency and granularity in reporting of each sector’s financials, which is required to fully understand the dynamics in specific market segments.", "In this regard, recent initiatives by several pharmaceutical manufacturers to provide more price transparency are welcome.27-29 In any case, efforts to control drug costs should focus on the rents enjoyed by all players in the distribution system.", "Support for this project was provided by the Schaeffer Center for Health Policy & Economics and by Amgen through a contract with Precision Health Economics.", "The views expressed herein are those of the authors and do not represent the views of the funders, and the sponsors had no role in the research.", "Goldman is a co-founder of Precision Health Economics and holds equity in its parent company.

We also achieved record non-GAAP earnings per share of $14.40,1 up 14% from the prior year, and free cash flow of $10.6 billion,1 another record.", "Amgen's non-GAAP operating margin of 53%,1 though down slightly from the prior year, still ranked among industry leaders.", "We invested $3.7 billion1 in research and development, reflecting both our commitment to innovation and our confidence in the potential of Amgen's growing pipeline.", "With unwavering commitment, Amgen staff delivered a one-year total shareholder return of 15% and a five-year return of 93%, outperforming our peer group and the S&P 500 over both time periods.", "We also returned $21.4 billion to shareholders in 2018 in the form of dividends and share repurchases.", "Our achievements in 2018 capped a five-year period of intense transformation during which we met or exceeded the ambitious financial commitments that we made to our shareholders (see below).", "Simultaneously—and critically—we continued to set the stage for our future, strengthening Amgen's long-term ability to innovate, compete and grow.", "During our transformation, we generated approximately $1.9 billion in gross cost savings that we redeployed into our business while embedding a set of productivity capabilities throughout our organization.", "These capabilities open new options for Amgen's business as we have built foundational flexibility in what is a highly dynamic operating environment.", "Let me share some additional highlights of our transformation, framed through our major 2018 achievements.", "Innovation continues to be the lifeblood of our business. Over the past five years, we invested nearly $19 billion1 in R&D and, as a result, are now advancing a record number of clinical assets through our pipeline.", "This includes a blossoming early-stage oncology pipeline with approximately 20 molecules in development.", "For example, we put 10 new, first-in-human molecules in our portfolio in 2018 alone, and a number of those in our oncology portfolio will be generating important data over the course of 2019.", "In the last two years, we filed 20 investigational new drug applications, 70% of which are first-in-class, which means they are based on a new mechanism of action.", "In the later stages of development, three programs have reached Phase 3, including tezepelumab, a first-in-class biologic treatment for severe asthma.", "In 2018, the U.S. FDA granted a Breakthrough Therapy Designation for tezepelumab in a significant subset of asthma patients—those without an eosinophilic phenotype.", "The unmet need for asthma is enormous, and new treatments are urgently needed. Severe asthma affects more than 30 million people worldwide and is expected to grow as more people move to cities.", "Along with our substantial R&D investment, we made significant strides in R&D productivity. During our transformation, we drove a 3-percentage-point improvement in R&D efficiency—meaning that the output we are achieving today with our R&D investment at 16%1 of sales is roughly equivalent to what we were achieving with 19%1 of our sales five years ago.", "In short, we are achieving more with each dollar of investment.", "Our R&D cycle times also decreased, further improving our efficiency. During the past five years, we reduced our new drug development cycle time by an average of approximately 36 months, reflecting our commitment to bringing innovative medicines to patients as quickly and safely as possible.", "One prominent example: in 2018, we moved AMG 510, a potential treatment for non-small cell lung and colorectal cancers, from discovery to first-in-human trials in just seven months.", "That was a record for us, and we expect to have new clinical data to share on AMG 510 later in 2019.", "We also continue to invest heavily in what we believe is a differentiated approach to human genetics.", "We now have a pipeline that is 75% genetically validated to various degrees, up from 15% five years ago.", "Human genetic validation provides us with earlier, better insights into which of the proposed new therapies have the greatest potential for approval and success, enabling us to invest accordingly.", "Amgen took an early lead in human genetic validation in 2012 by acquiring Iceland-based deCODE Genetics, now a wholly owned Amgen subsidiary.", "Today, more than half of the Icelandic population are participants in deCODE's research, along with 1 million participants outside of Iceland.", "In 2018, we expanded this capability through a new collaboration with a prominent U.S.-based integrated delivery network.", "This should bring us an additional 500,000 participants to study by genotype and phenotype.", "Our R&D pipeline yielded nine approved and launched products during our transformation, including two in new therapeutic areas for Amgen—Repatha® in cardiovascular disease (launched in 2015) and Aimovig® in neuroscience (launched in collaboration with Novartis in 2018).", "Repatha® is an LDL cholesterol treatment proven to reduce heart attacks and strokes in patients with established heart disease.", "Repatha® sales increased 72% in 2018 to $550 million, with volume nearly doubling versus the prior year.", "In 2018, we made Repatha® available at a 60% reduced list price in the U.S. to help lower out-of-pocket costs, especially for Medicare patients, which will enable us to serve more patients (see below).", "Aimovig® emerged as one of the most successful new product introductions in recent industry history. Aimovig® is purpose-built to treat migraine and is quickly gaining acceptance among patients and physicians.", "With millions of migraine patients in the U.S. alone, we expect Aimovig® to be a significant growth driver for Amgen for years to come.", "In 2018, we launched Parsabiv®, the first new treatment in more than a decade for secondary hyperparathyroidism.", "This therapy provides patients and healthcare providers with a novel option to help treat a complex disease that affects a significant number of patients on hemodialysis.", "Our oncology/hematology portfolio is now well positioned to be an important growth engine for the future.", "In 2018, combined sales of XGEVA®, KYPROLIS®, Nplate®, Vectibix®, BLINCYTO® and IMLYGIC® exceeded $4.4 billion, growing 14% over the prior year.", "KYPROLIS®, one of our newer medicines, has delivered a suite of clinical evidence demonstrating its ability to meaningfully extend overall survival in patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma.", "Prolia®, prescribed to reduce the risk of fracture in postmenopausal women with osteoporosis, continued to deliver strong double-digit volume growth in 2018.", "Launched in 2010, it is being used to treat approximately 4 million people, a fraction of the tens of millions of people who have osteoporosis worldwide and are at risk from the often devastating effects of bone fracture.", "2018 was also a landmark year in our commitment to biosimilars, a business we established during our transformation period.", "Biosimilars can offer new, high-value options for patients and payers, and Amgen is committed to success in this promising but highly competitive arena.", "In 2018, we launched our first biosimilars, both outside the U.S.: AMGEVITA™, a biosimilar to AbbVie's HUMIRA®, and KANJINTI™, a biosimilar to Roche's Herceptin®.", "We believe that Amgen's reputation for reliable supply and safety is an important contributor to our success in this field.", "We plan to launch a series of biosimilars in the coming years, taking advantage of our deep expertise and long, high-quality track record in precision biologics manufacturing.", "Further leveraging this expertise, we developed and deployed our next-generation biomanufacturing capability.", "During our transformation, we advanced two state-of-the-art facilities, which improve both efficiency and environmental friendliness, while sustaining our high standards for quality and reliable supply.", "Our first next-generation facility, in Singapore, was licensed by regulators in 2017. Last year, we broke ground on a second, similar facility in Rhode Island, where we already have a large manufacturing presence.", "This investment became possible due to improved U.S. competitiveness from tax reform.", "Reliable supply is an essential element in the drive to expand Amgen's global commercial reach. We now have a presence in approximately 100 countries, up from 50 countries in 2011, enabling us to play a growing role in serving the world's exploding demand for better healthcare.", "In January 2019, we launched Repatha® in China, our inaugural product launch in what is now the world's second largest pharmaceutical market.", "In Japan, the world's third largest pharma market, the Amgen Astellas BioPharma joint venture recently received two important new product approvals: BLINCYTO® for the treatment of relapsed or refractory B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia and EVENITY™† for the treatment of osteoporosis in patients at high risk of fracture.", "We fully recognize the challenge of global expansion and are greatly encouraged by our strong unit volume growth internationally.", "Sales from outside the U.S. are expected to account for an increasing percentage of our total revenues over the next decade.", "Success in the research-based biopharmaceutical industry demands the ability to deliver results not just quarter to quarter but generation to generation as well.", "As just discussed, we have numerous meaningful opportunities ahead, including recently launched branded biologic and biosimilar products, our continued expansion into new markets globally and the cultivation of a robust and differentiated pipeline.", "We have also anticipated challenges in front of us, including generic competition for Sensipar®, increasing competition for our rheumatoid arthritis product Enbrel® and additional biosimilar competition for EPOGEN®, NEUPOGEN® and Neulasta®.", "We are prepared for these challenges and face them from a position of strength. I want to make it clear: we have a long-term commitment to the hallmark of Amgen—innovation—and have the determination and resources to meet these competitive challenges and deliver growth over the long term.", "Notably, we now have the ability to operate more quickly and nimbly across the business, starting in R&D and extending through manufacturing and commercial operations.", "We are a leader in capital-efficient biologics manufacturing and have built a global commercial enterprise focused on cultivating the best opportunities, wherever they may be.", "We have a strong balance sheet and cash flows, a reputation for excellence in science and strategic partnership and a culture that is a beacon for people with the sophisticated knowledge and skill to make a difference in global health.", "And we are well positioned with a broad array of products that address large patient populations in areas of great unmet need, along with therapies that make a difference for more limited patient populations.", "In short, while our ambitious five-year goals for 2018 were reached, our transformation continues. We have great confidence in our ability to meet the expected challenges and to break through to the next phase of growth.", "In less than 40 years, Amgen went from a tiny, venture-backed biotechnology startup to an important force in global healthcare.", "We are now integrated into the global healthcare ecosystem, centered on patients but also engaging fully with other major healthcare communities: physicians and other providers, governments and private payers, investors, regulators and society at large.", "In 2018, we began talking in earnest about our long-term ambition: to bend the curve of healthcare. By that, we're signaling that we intend to take a significant role to ensure that more people have greater access to better healthcare, both now and for generations to come.", "We are committed to exploring and pursuing healthcare solutions that reinvent and even disrupt the current approaches to healthcare access, cost, value and innovation.", "The galvanizing call to \"bend the curve of healthcare\" is rooted in the recognition that healthcare systems globally are at an inflection point.", "People want better healthcare and are striving to secure it. While we continue to see exciting opportunities ahead, the Age Wave is cresting with unprecedented challenges to keeping people healthy and productive.", "Many healthcare systems are feeling the strains, though they are responding to today's problems with yesterday's systems and solutions.", "In the U.S., people know intuitively that the healthcare system is cumbersome and the upward curve of cost is not sustainable.", "We are sensitive to this sentiment. Overall, the net selling price of our medicines declined in 2018, and we expect a mid-single-digit decline in 2019.", "In general, we believe sales growth will ultimately come from increased volume and access as opposed to price increases.", "We are also committed to helping patients access our medicines via the Amgen Safety Net Foundation, which provides our therapies to qualifying U.S. patients who cannot afford them.", "In 2018, the commercial value of our therapies provided through the Amgen Safety Net Foundation exceeded $1 billion.", "We also made a donation of Amgen cancer treatments and supportive care medicines, commercially valued at $93 million, to nonprofit, humanitarian aid organization Direct Relief, which they distributed to patients in 18 developing countries at zero cost.", "Drug costs, however, are just part of the picture, given that biopharmaceuticals represent approximately 14% of the U.S. healthcare bill, roughly the same percentage as in 1960.", "Study after study has shown that good health is strongly connected with human happiness and productivity and that it is also a galvanizing force for societal and economic development.", "At Amgen, bending the curve in healthcare means finding ways, including disruptive ones, to accelerate the positive trends in healthcare and change the course of negative ones.", "Consider cardiovascular disease as an example. The good news here is that due to advances in prevention, public health and medicine, the rates of cardiovascular disease have dropped precipitously over the past 20 years.", "The bad news is that despite decades of steady progress, half of all adults in the U.S. still have some type of cardiovascular disease.", "In 2016 (the last year for which we have statistics), the number of deaths from cardiovascular disease actually rose over the prior year to approximately 840,000 in the U.S. Behind that statistic are millions of heartbreaking stories—from people debilitated by failing hearts to family caregivers who must now face difficult choices.", "Aside from the human misery, there's a staggering direct cost: some $600 billion in the U.S. alone, as projected by the American Heart Association for 2019.", "This is slated to rise to an estimated $900 billion by 2030 if we, as a society, fail to intercept this trajectory.", "We can bend the curve. It will take much in the way of partnership, including coordinated efforts in patient education, healthcare access, prevention and public health.", "It will also take continued biomedical innovation, such as the science behind Repatha®, to meet the needs of those for whom current treatments in lipid lowering may not be enough.", "At a time when someone in the U.S. has a heart attack or stroke every 40 seconds, a medicine such as Repatha® can bend the curve of healthcare in the right direction.", "That is why we work so hard to ensure that every patient who might benefit from Repatha® has access to it.", "It is also why we are working on a new treatment for heart failure, omecamtiv mecarbil, in Phase 3 clinical development.", "Overall, a rapidly aging global population will mean a dramatic rise in the number of people suffering from serious, age-related illnesses like cancer, dementia and cardiovascular disease.", "Medicare and Medicaid direct costs for Alzheimer's are estimated at $186 billion annually—rising to $750 billion by 2050 if the current trends continue.", "Our effort in this area includes AMG 520, a Phase 3 asset we are developing in partnership with Novartis, which could provide a new preventative treatment option.", "Innovation has genuine potential to bend the curve of Alzheimer's disease and many other serious diseases that impact millions of people.", "We know we must continue to innovate—and frame the power of innovation in our dialogue with others—so that patients today and in the future benefit from the biomedical revolution we are helping to shape.", "That dialogue starts with listening. We listen intently to all healthcare communities, starting with patients, who visit our facilities to speak with, teach and inspire us (see below).", "There is nothing more powerful for us than to listen to patients whose lives have been meaningfully affected by our work—and whose own life trajectories have been changed through our efforts and your investment.", "We know that for every patient success story, there are still far too many others that don't end well.", "\"Bending the curve of healthcare\" takes on special meaning when many patients do not have time on their side.", "That realization brings a sense of urgency to everything we do.", "Looking ahead, we are ready to build on our recent transformation successes, including maintaining and improving on our leading process development and manufacturing capabilities, driving our innovation and expanding our outreach in patient access and services to more regions around the world.", "We will sustain the gains of the past five years through a culture of productivity so that the time, talent and capital invested in Amgen is put to good use.", "We will continue to deliver on our commitments to patients, to you as shareholders and to all those we serve, both year to year and generation to generation.", "On behalf of Amgen's board of directors and leadership team, thank you for your continued investment and support.", "I also thank our more than 21,000 staff members around the world for their commitment to ethics—and to our mission.", "It is our shared privilege to work at the leading edge of innovation and for a company making a positive difference in the lives of so many people every day.", "Every 40 seconds, someone in the U.S. has a heart attack or stroke. Repatha®, Amgen's medicine for people with high LDL cholesterol who are at risk for heart attacks and strokes, can help to address this significant public health issue, but concerns over out-of-pocket costs were proving to be a barrier to its use for a large number of patients.", "For example, an estimated 75% of Medicare patients prescribed a PCSK9 inhibitor like Repatha® were never actually filling their prescriptions—a situation that we found unacceptable.", "In October 2018, Amgen took the bold action of making Repatha® available in the U.S. at 60% less than its original list price, leading directly to lower out-of-pocket costs for some patients, especially seniors on Medicare.", "Bob C. from Boca Raton, Florida, shown here, is one of them.", "\"Since turning 65 and going on Medicare, I have had to make one of the hardest decisions of my life: can I afford to stay on Repatha®, the only thing—even after nine stents and numerous statins—that has worked to lower my cholesterol?\"", "he said. \"Amgen's decision to significantly lower the list price of Repatha® means that I can continue taking a therapy that has been so effective for me.\"", "Amgen's action drew praise from the American Heart Association, which stated, \"We are heartened by Amgen's substantial commitment to reduce the costs of their proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) inhibitor as part of a larger collaborative effort across the public, private and independent sectors to shift the focus to the value of treatment and not simply its costs.\"", "One of the great medical success stories of the past few decades has been the progress that has been made against cancer.", "From its peak in 1991, the cancer death rate in the U.S. has fallen by 26%, while the chances that a cancer patient will live five or more years have increased by 41% across all cancers.", "A large part of these remarkable gains can be attributed to innovative new cancer medicines, but we certainly can't declare victory yet over a disease that still claims more than 9 million lives a year worldwide.", "In 2018, much of the attention of the oncology community was focused on a new class of medicines known as bispecific T cell engagers, or BiTE® molecules.", "Pioneered by Amgen, BiTE® technology is a targeted immuno-oncology platform designed to engage the patient's own immune system to fight cancer.", "Amgen already has one BiTE® therapy on the market: BLINCYTO® for acute refractory or relapsed B-cell lymphoblastic leukemia.", "At the American Society of Hematology's annual meeting in December 2018, we presented data on two investigational BiTE® therapies in our early-stage pipeline: AMG 420 to treat patients with relapsed and/or refractory multiple myeloma and AMG 330 to treat patients with relapsed or refractory acute myeloid leukemia.", "The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has granted Fast Track and Orphan Drug Designation to AMG 420, indicating the acute need for new treatments for multiple myeloma patients, many of whom have run out of available options.", "\"Despite recent treatment advances, multiple myeloma continues to be a disease characterized by cycles of relapse and recurrence requiring additional therapies to help control the disease,\" said Max S. Topp, M.D., professor, Hospital of Wuerzburg, Germany, and AMG 420 clinical study investigator.", "At the start of every year, Amgen gathers its top leaders from around the world to gain alignment on our path forward.", "The highlight of these meetings is the opportunity to hear firsthand from patients who have benefited from our medicines, and this year's meeting was no exception.", "Kayleen H. has been battling migraine for more than 20 years. Like so many others with this misunderstood and undertreated disease, Kayleen suffered frequent and debilitating migraines that came to dominate her life, preventing her from working and placing a tremendous burden on her family.", "In fact, according to Kayleen, her migraine on a scale of one to 10 was an eight—each and every day—and often spiked higher than that.", "As was the case with Kayleen, migraine frequently strikes people in the prime of their lives. As a result, migraine is particularly costly in terms of lost productivity, with U.S. employers losing an estimated $11 billion each year, largely due to missed workdays.", "Kayleen tried many treatment options over the years with little success. She began taking Aimovig®, Amgen's new medicine specifically designed to help prevent migraine, in June 2018.", "\"I have been amazed at how well it works,\" she said. \"I have less migraine days now, and I'm in a really good place.\"‡", "Over the years, Amgen has helped communities around the world to recover after natural disasters. In 2018, disaster struck close to home.", "On November 7, a gunman killed 12 people, including many college students, at the Borderline Bar and Grill, located less than four miles from our world headquarters in Thousand Oaks, California.", "The next afternoon, as our community was reeling from this terrible act of violence, major wildfires broke out and raged in the valleys surrounding our campus for two weeks before they were finally contained.", "While thankfully no Amgen lives were lost, thousands of our staff were forced to gather their belongings and flee their homes.", "Our Amgen campus was closed for several days to all but essential personnel, including about 80 staff assigned to our Emergency Operations Center.", "These dedicated colleagues rotated in 12-hour shifts for nine days throughout the crisis. They assessed threats to our buildings, monitored air quality to determine the health risk posed by the pervasive smoke and kept track of the safety of our people.", "Beyond this core team, hundreds of Amgen staff lent a helping hand by giving blood, donating to relief funds and opening their own homes to colleagues and neighbors who were evacuated.", "We showed our appreciation to local first responders by sending multiple food trucks to the Woolsey Fire Command Post and other field operations, where professionals and volunteers were serving shifts as long as 18 hours to contain the fires.", "Amgen staff expressed their gratitude to these heroes with hundreds of thank you notes as well as events for the first responders and their families.", "In addition to these personal expressions of support, the Amgen Foundation pledged $500,000 to support victims of the fires and $250,000 to support those affected by the Borderline shooting.", "Of the thousands of companies founded as part of the biotech revolution of the 1980s, only two of note remain independent to this day.", "We believe the key to our enduring success is a culture built around a mission to serve patients, an aspiration to be the world's best human therapeutics company and a set of values that emphasize patients, science, ethics, trust and respect.", "Our mission, aspiration and values resonate with our staff. In fact, we regularly survey our staff and are encouraged that 95% understand how their work contributes to Amgen's success.", "Our surveys also ask what three words come to mind when thinking about Amgen's culture. The words cited most often are \"innovative,\" \"patients\" and \"science.\"", "We do not take our culture for granted.

Human mAbs offer efficient modulation in effector functions and are less immunogenic as compared to chimeric or humanized mAbs.", "Such antibodies can be produced through the use of phage display and hybridoma technologies in transgenic mice.", "As a result, with recent technological progress in genetic engineering, the production of fully human mAbs is anticipated to gain traction in the near future.", "Humanized mAbs are expected to grow at the fastest CAGR of 11.6% over the forecast period due to their widespread use against a broad range of target antigens such as cancer cells, or immunosuppressor and immunomodulatory molecules.", "Demand for such antibodies is also supported by their lower immunogenicity as compared to chimeric mAbs.", "However, these antibodies are more immunogenic as compared to human mAbs, which may restrict the market growth.", "In vitro production type held the larger market share of 76.9% in 2022 due to its economic viability in long production runs and lower propensity for contamination with foreign antigens.", "In addition, the availability of serum-free culture media and semi-permeable membrane-based systems has increased the feasibility of biomanufacturing operations and is likely to accelerate segment growth.", "However, the production type is limited by variations in hybridoma characteristics that can lead to denaturation or inactivation of antibodies and restrict the segment growth.", "In vivo production type is expected to grow at a significant rate in the forecast period due to its highly cost-effective production as compared to in vitro techniques and ability to produce a high concentration of mAbs.", "These mAbs are used in the diagnostic industry, wherein cost considerations are of prime importance, and optimization of in vivo procedures can be done to increase the secretion of mAbs.", "Oncology segment dominated the applications market for mAbs and accounted for 49.2% of the market value in 2022.", "This can be attributed to the high number of regulatory approvals for mAbs aimed at cancer treatment.", "The surge in the incidence of cancer is a key factor anticipated to drive the growth of mAbs therapeutics as these can have minimal adverse effects as compared to other drugs and chemotherapy interventions.", "Currently, available mAb therapeutics include those targeted against non-small cell lung, brain tumor, ovarian, breast, gastric, melanoma, colorectal, Hodgkin’s lymphoma, and others.", "Applications of mAbs for the treatment of autoimmune diseases are projected to grow at a lucrative rate due to the increasing prevalence of autoimmune conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis.", "Furthermore, with growth in the number of cytokine proteins identified in inflammatory pathways that can be targeted for disease mitigation, applications of mAbs in this domain are anticipated to witness growth.", "The hospitals segment held the largest market share of 39.7% in 2022 due to the increasing adoption of mAbs for cancer treatment at hospitals.", "Rising healthcare expenditure across the world, increasing patient awareness levels, and availability of advanced hospital infrastructure in developed countries are factors expected to result in the dominance of the segment during the forecast period.", "Specialty centers accounted for a significant market share in 2021 due to the increasing government support in recent years.", "For instance, the National Cancer Institute’s Cancer Centers Program is establishing standards for transdisciplinary cancer centers focused on the prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of various types of cancers.", "Such initiatives are expected to positively affect the segment growth.", "North America recorded the largest market share of 46.1%

Traditional banks, for example, may be underestimating fintechs.", "The fintech industry has exploded over the last decade and is now worth an estimated £7 billion in the UK alone.", "A recent report by the Bank of England found that traditional banks believe they can cope with fintech competition without making big changes to their business models or taking on more risk—but also that fintechs may cause “greater and faster disruption” to banks’ business models than the banks themselves project.", "One reason for an inward shift could be complexity. Successful companies have a tendency to gradually become inward facing because organizational complexity has increased.", "When successful companies grow, so do the breadth and depth of business requirements. As a response, companies tend to create dedicated structures, processes, systems, and metrics that increase the complicatedness of the organization.", "Significant resources and attention must then be devoted to internal management. (See “How Complicated Is Your Company?,” BCG article, January 2018.)", "Success can also make companies look inward because, by generating too much free cash flow for allocation, success can exacerbate an agency problem: managers might push to keep as many resources as possible under their control and thus invest all extra cash in projects in-house, while, in contrast, board members might want to maximize the payoff for shareholders and thus avoid investing in projects that gradually become, according to the law of diminishing returns, less attractive.", "Maintaining an outside-in drive starts by continuously scanning the market, both demand and supply. On the demand side, successful companies must see themselves through the eyes of the customer and constantly look out for early signs of potential megatrends.", "On the supply side, companies must be willing and able to engage in partnerships and collaborations.", "For example, in 2011, Umicore, a Belgian metals and mining company, wanted to expand its recycling activities in order to recover rare earth elements from rechargeable batteries.", "The company possessed a state-of-the-art battery-recycling process—the Ultra High Temperature (UHT) process—but lacked the capabilities to refine rare earths.", "It thus partnered with Rhodia, a French chemical company. Together, the two companies developed the first industrial process that closed the loop on the rare earths contained in batteries.", "Breakthrough innovation is rarely performed by one single actor end-to-end, and participation in relevant partnerships, platforms, or ecosystems can be key.", "When disruptive shocks hit, they must be fully embraced. Doing so first requires companies to recognize risks.", "Strategic decision making in the context of risk can be subject to multiple cognitive biases. One example is loss aversion, in which the thought of losing something one has is more abhorrent than not taking advantage of a new opportunity for gain.", "Therefore, there is a tendency to overvalue current business models compared with new, disruptive models and their opportunities.", "To sidestep that problem, companies must be brutally honest and recognize that market conditions won’t remain the same forever.", "They never do. Profitable businesses inevitably attract potential entrants with innovative business models.", "In practice, fully embracing disruption means that at times companies must respond by being disruptive themselves rather than making small incremental fixes to their current model.", "Tobacco companies understood this when they invested—massively—in electronic cigarettes. Electronic cigarettes have been around for nearly 30 years but gained strong momentum only recently, pushed by small emerging players such as V2, Juul, and Mig Vapor.", "Large tobacco companies decided to embrace disruption by bringing to market their own solutions. Philip Morris International (PMI), for example, invested about $3 billion to develop its iQOS.", "The company has done so despite the high cannibalization risk to its current business.", "Another example involves the introduction of mobile technologies. When telecom companies faced the entrance of mobile technologies, they could have responded either by incrementally refining their old landline business or by using those innovative mobile technologies themselves to become part of the disruptive force.", "In the longer term, only the latter approach allowed companies to realize the full benefits of disruption.", "Overall, when disruption hits, major commitments have to be made, even if doing so is painful. These commitments can also mean deprioritizing profitable activities to focus resources—management attention, talent, or financial resources—on disruptive trends.", "Neste, a Finnish oil-refining company, invested heavily in renewable-diesel production, foreseeing regulatory changes in the EU that would create a market for diesel made from renewable sources.", "The 2% companies have an explicit model for managing the inevitable tradeoffs between near- and long-term priorities.", "The right model for the subsequent renewal also optimally leverages the capabilities of the company and fits the organizational culture.", "Needless to say, these models are company specific and there is no “one size fits all.” In our work with various industries and in ongoing discussions with executives, we’ve identified a set of models.", "We offer five recommendations for becoming a 2% company:", "1. Invite challenge and coaching from the outside. Welcome differing opinions. Be willing to be challenged by, and to learn from, others.", "No one can be right all the time, and welcoming outsiders so that you can benefit from their unbiased, outside-in perspectives will help you stay close to customers and nascent market trends.", "Having a clear picture of those trends will also prevent your company from setting out in a wrong direction and provides the confidence necessary to make difficult decisions.", "2. Think in multiple time frames. Ask yourself what you’re doing to best position yourself for next year, five years from now, and ten years from now.", "This mindset will enable both exploration and exploitation activities and strike the right balance of the two.", "Thinking in multiple time frames is also a critical first step toward defining the right renewal model for your company, as it ensures that your chosen strategy will deliver results at all relevant time frames.", "3. Get ahead of any crisis. Recognize risk and be brutally honest. Once risks and opportunities have been clearly identified, make sure you address disruption in the way that best positions your company and takes full advantage of the disruptive forces.", "Have the courage to act promptly and preemptively: establish an early-mover advantage that can be instrumental for sustainable success.", "4. Be skeptical of current success. One should never rest on one’s laurels. Successful companies must stay sober and modest so as to avoid creating a company culture that rests on complacency and self-satisfaction.", "Rather, keep a mindset of continuous quest for improvement and search for novel ideas. This will trickle down through the entire organization and ensure that key stakeholders always push the frontier of possibilities.", "5. Review your renewal strategies explicitly. Pursuing excellence on all four of the previously described traits can be exhausting for an organization.", "As a result, explicitly reviewing your company’s performance is necessary to ensure that all dimensions are tackled and that there are no gaps between intention and action.", "To this end, we have built a simple, pragmatic assessment tool that helps executives to rapidly weigh their strategies against the four traits.", "We call it the “2% cockpit” because it helps to show executives how to pilot their organizations the way that 2% companies do.", "The 2% companies set a high bar. But by emulating these performance leaders and heeding the recommendations set forth above, other companies can achieve and sustain a higher level of success than they currently enjoy.", "Ten years from now, we may find ourselves talking about new manifestations of exploration and exploitation and an expanded roster of companies that excel at both innovation and efficiency: the 3%—or more.", "The BCG Henderson Institute is Boston Consulting Group’s strategy think tank, dedicated to exploring and developing valuable new insights from business, technology, and science by embracing the powerful technology of ideas.", "The Institute engages leaders in provocative discussion and experimentation to expand the boundaries of business theory and practice and to translate innovative ideas from within and beyond business.", "For more ideas and inspiration from the Institute, please visit Featured Insights.", "Managing Director & Senior Partner, Chairman of the BCG Henderson Institute", "Boston Consulting Group partners with leaders in business and society to tackle their most important challenges and capture their greatest opportunities.", "BCG was the pioneer in business strategy when it was founded in 1963. Today, we work closely with clients to embrace a transformational approach aimed at benefiting all stakeholders—empowering organizations to grow, build sustainable competitive advantage, and drive positive societal impact.", "Our diverse, global teams bring deep industry and functional expertise and a range of perspectives that question the status quo and spark change.", "BCG delivers solutions through leading-edge management consulting, technology and design, and corporate and digital ventures.", "We work in a uniquely collaborative model across the firm and throughout all levels of the client organization, fueled by the goal of helping our clients thrive and enabling them to make the world a better place.", "© Boston Consulting Group 2025.

Once again, it is mainly the Southern and Eastern European countries that rank low on this indicator.", "While the low levels of input could provide a basis for arguing that Horizon 2020 may contribute to a remedy to the underinvestment problem, a look at the efficiency of the use of inputs suggests that “underinvestment” is largely a response to low resource efficiency.", "In order to identify resource efficiency, we analysed the ability of national innovation systems to generate transnational patents – i.e. patents filed at the European Patent Office or the World Intellectual Property Organization11 – and scientific publications in relation to the countries’ number of researchers in companies and in the public science system.", "We used data envelopment analysis to calculate the variable returns to scale efficiencies, which take on a value of 1 if a country reaches the highest possible value of output for a given level of input and 0 if it generates no output.", "Again, we see tremendous heterogeneity among countries (see Figure 4).

First, the low R&D investment levels in many Southern and Eastern European countries are not the result of underinvestment (which may be tackled by providing additional funds through Horizon 2020) but are rather a rational response to relatively low capabilities to transfer research investment into research output.", "Second, for the efficiency of funding provided through Horizon 2020, this implies that the expected outputs from a given amount of resources will differ widely by country of destination.", "Take Portugal’s patent efficiency of 0.07, for example.

emergency.1", "Relevant data over the past few years have shown alarming trends, with Europe remaining a world leader only in terms of public money spent on research and development (R&D) and gradually losing its lead in most substantive innovation outcome indicators.2", "This has led to a proliferation of efforts at the EU level to spur innovation, from the launch of the Innovation Union flagship initiative within the Europe 2020 strategy to the setting of a specific long-term goal of reaching three per cent of public and private spending on R&D in the EU by 2020.", "One of the most visible projects is the Horizon 2020 programme, which devotes an unprecedented amount of financial resources to the joint promotion of research and innovation.", "Today, halfway through the decade-long Europe 2020 strategy and a year after the launch of Horizon 2020, the results are inevitably mixed and the available data open to interpretation.", "In the 2014 Innovation Union Scoreboard, the European Commission announced that the EU has halved the gap with the US and Japan, although Korea continues to distance itself and China is quickly catching up.3 Such findings, however, have to be weighed against the fact that innovation (and its related indicators) is only an intermediate outcome: its virtue lies in fostering productivity and growth and improving social welfare and well-being.", "In this respect, it is legitimate to ask whether Europe’s timidly improving performance on the innovation scoreboard will pave the way towards growth or whether other actions would be needed to ensure that enhanced public and private R&D spending becomes an engine for economic recovery.", "This short paper discusses the way in which innovation and entrepreneurship are changing and analyses the evolving role and scope of innovation policy in light of the exponential acceleration of technology expected between now and the end of the decade.", "The main argument put forward in this paper is that due to the advent of cloud computing, the Internet of Things and the increased virtualisation of phases of the value chain, innovation will occur in so many different ways that governments will be forced to focus on a limited number of very crucial roles, such as facilitating the flow of information and promoting the competitiveness of innovation platforms where needed.", "In this respect, even if it is too soon to draw any conclusion on a programme that only started a year ago, Horizon 2020 seems to bring laudable changes to the way in which the EU conceives of its innovation policy: the role of the European Institute of Innovation and Technology (EIT) should be further strengthened by linking European Innovation Partnerships to the EIT’s Knowledge and Innovation Communities, as well as with the Joint Technology Initiatives foreseen under the new Horizon 2020 programme.", "The paper also argues that the reallocation of funds from Horizon 2020 to the European Fund for Strategic Investment (EFSI) recently announced by the new President of the European Commission Jean-Claude Juncker is not necessarily bad news for EU innovation.", "What might be more alarming, however, is the weaker emphasis being placed on innovation policy, which resulted in an apparently “thin” mandate being given to the new Commissioner for Science, Research and Innovation.", "In addition, the paper argues that urgent measures are needed on all those areas of the EU acquis that, despite not being labelled as innovation policy, exert a strong influence on the level of innovation and entrepreneurship observed in the European economy – namely competition law, education policy, red tape reduction and investment in infrastructure.", "Until a couple of years ago, most of the debate about the lack of innovation in Europe focused on the absence of a common patent system, which according to many commentators was inhibiting innovative efforts by European SMEs.", "Today, despite considerable progress and a long-awaited political agreement, no one would claim that Europe’s innovation problem will be significantly closer to a solution once the unitary patent and the Unified Patent Court are in place.", "Our understanding of innovation has improved over the past several years: today, the complexity of the innovation ecosystem is changing the way we look at innovation policy (to the extent that innovation can be termed as a “policy” anymore).", "A consensus has emerged that several concomitant ingredients have to be present for the recipe to work.", "First, innovation is increasingly less related to R&D spending. A newly emerging phenomenology of innovation contemplates many forms that do not entail a traditional industrial R&D process, and in many instances even require little or no resources.", "Examples are manifold, such as India’s frugal innovation model, the various meanings currently attributed to the term “social innovation”, and the fragmentation of the definition of innovation into its product, process, marketing and organisational dimensions.", "A look at the Forbes list of the top innovative companies for 2014 provides a snapshot of the new understanding of innovation in the international community: while the top 15 include many pharmaceutical companies, it also includes cloud computing companies and even unexpected champions such as Hermés International and Monster beverages.4 The top R&D investors around the world are not necessarily the leading innovators, and innovation takes place throughout the value chain, including at the business model and distribution channel levels.", "This is no surprise: looking at the data on labour productivity in the United States and the European Union, it strikes one immediately that one of the main determinants of the gap between the two blocs is the availability of high-level managerial skills.5", "Second, innovation is “changing skin” at an accelerating pace. The past decade marked a sea change in the way innovation occurs in various sectors.", "This is even truer for the ICT sector, where the intangible nature of most product and system components makes it possible to obtain innovative products through collaborative efforts distributed throughout the globe.", "- From single-firm to systemic to collaborative: Today, innovation is increasingly a collaborative, collective effort, rather than the product of a single brain in an R&D lab.", "Forms of collaboration give rise to new conglomerates governed mostly by weak property rules or even liability rules.", "The typical examples are “copyleft” rules in open-source software, FRAND licensing agreements in patent pools and royalty-free cross-licensing agreements.6", "- From proprietary to modular to granular: The modularity of products has been on the rise in recent decades, as testified by the pioneering work of Langlois.7 Increasingly, modularity determines the need for collaboration between producers of complementary goods and services, and intellectual property is being (or should be) redesigned to facilitate these forms of cooperation.", "- From supply-led innovation to co-innovation to user innovation: The original paradigm of “technology push, demand pull” in innovation belongs to the History Channel today.", "Co-innovation is becoming more widespread, especially in the IT world, but also in other technology-intensive sectors such as pharmaceuticals and biotech.", "In emerging economic sectors, especially in the digital environment, co-innovation is being replaced or complemented by user innovation, in which users take the lead in developing new solutions that match their industry needs.", "- From closed to semi-open to (almost fully) open: As collaboration and granularity become more widespread, product architectures also become less proprietary and are gradually replaced by semi-open and fully open models of production.", "For example, in modern broadband communications platforms such as those found on our smartphones and personal computers, proprietary models such as those adopted by Apple in the 1980s have been supplanted by semi-open models such as the one coordinated by Microsoft, which tried to maximise two-sided market effects by stimulating the widespread development of Windows-compatible applications.8", "Third, innovation is an ecosystem, and as such it requires the simultaneous existence of several actors, each with a different role to play.", "In academic literature, the concept of a National Innovation System emerged in the 1980s and is normally referred to as “the set of public and private actors involved in the exploitation and commercialisation of new knowledge originating from the science and technology base and the interactions in between them”.9 This concept has been operationalised by several academics, including, among others, Porter and Stern and Archibugi et al.,10 who develop indexes of national innovative capacity that rely heavily on the specific role played by each of the main actors that shape innovation patterns and success in a given country.", "These actors include large businesses and SMEs, university and research institutes, venture capitalists and business angels, and government.", "All the key players and elements of an innovation ecosystem have to be in place for a country to be able to create innovation in support of growth and well-being.", "This means that investing in R&D is not going to be a sufficient strategy unless large and small companies are able to develop an effective symbiotic relationship, fed by the university system, supported by public or private funding sources, demanded by a sufficiently large market, and facilitated by an innovation-oriented government.", "In this latter respect, the science of government has changed along with the changing nature of innovation.", "While important academic contributions recognise the importance of the state in driving innovation, such a role cannot (and should not) focus solely on the provision of funding.11 Rather, the state increasingly needs to act as a catalyst, able to realise the convergence and synergies between all necessary actors in the innovation ecosystem, while at the same time ensuring that innovative activity is encouraged, not stifled, by existing rules; that information can flow effectively in the marketplace, enabling the matching of supply and demand; that innovators have world-class infrastructure available to them, from connectivity to logistics; and that universities teach the right skills to their students and provide lifelong learning opportunities to both the employed and the unemployed throughout their lives.", "This description of the changing role of the state becomes even truer if one considers that by the end of the decade, we will witness important shifts in the way production is organised and in the way innovation takes place.", "Already now, the advent of cloud computing is enormously reducing the cost of market entry for small companies, while also providing SMEs with attractive platforms for innovation at little or no cost.", "Competition among platform operators such as Amazon, Salesforce, Google, Microsoft and many others is leading to the emergence of competing, semi-open architectures, each of which aims at maximising the number of applications available to their customers, and this in turn lowers barriers to entry for small, creative companies wishing to find space in the cloud.", "A year ago, an industry study already claimed that the European app economy accounted for 1.8 million jobs and blossoming sales volumes – without any need for EU funding.12", "Second, the emergence of the Internet of Things is paving the way for a number of innovative applications in a growing number of fields, again with limited need for high R&D investment at the outset.", "Innovation is likely to occur at a breathtaking pace with respect to the fourth industrial revolution or “industry 4.0”, which entails the use of cyber-physical products and services in support of cheaper, optimised industrial production of increasingly personalised products.", "Countries that are betting on this development, like Germany and the US, are already seeing the emergence of new start-ups that develop customised applications for specific phases of the virtualised production plants that are key to the development of industry 4.0.", "What these start-ups need, more than seed money, are a limited number of emerging platforms on which to test their ideas.", "Moreover, the development of technologies such as 3D printing is revolutionising the way in which firms test their products and develop them before deciding to build them.", "Many commentators have argued that this and similar technological solutions are leading to the end of the economies of scale in production and to a new era of mass customisation in products and services.", "Finally, the direction of innovation is likely to change, with companies blurring the boundaries between sectors.", "The recent investment made by Google X Life Sciences for the development of nanoparticles able to locate cancer cells is just one of many examples of companies that exploit their pivotal role in the new economy to extend their reach into other sectors and experiment with innovative solutions.", "Amazon’s investment in civil drones is another example. The more companies can reach end users and collect large amounts of data, the easier it becomes for them to create bridges between sectors.", "And the bigger they become, the more they need creative and innovative solutions to integrate within their giant platforms.", "This is where most of the innovation is likely to take place in the years to come.", "Faced with such developments, what should a government do to stimulate innovation? Public institutions can certainly play a crucial role in creating the right conditions for the acceleration of technological solutions to address emerging societal challenges, but they need to focus their efforts on addressing large-scale societal challenges that market forces are unlikely to tackle by themselves, on creating a fertile environment for entrepreneurship by tailoring regulation to the needs of innovation, and on ensuring that private sector innovation does not occur at the expenses of social welfare in the medium to long term.", "Against this background, the past years of innovation policy – most notably the launch of Horizon 2020 – have brought some beacons of hope.", "These are not exclusively related to the amount of money allocated to research and innovation in the EU budget, but instead are mostly due to the emphasis placed on the governance of innovation rather than on the selection of projects based on pre-determined criteria.", "In this respect, the three pillars of Horizon 2020 – excellent science, industrial leadership and societal challenges – appear much more in line with the needs of potential innovators and entrepreneurs than past projects like the 7th Framework Programme for Research and the Competitiveness and Innovation Programme for SMEs.", "In addition, and most importantly, the work of the European Institute of Innovation and Technology so far has led to a new way of approaching the governance of innovation through so-called Knowledge and Innovation Communities (KICs).", "Apart from the promising results obtained by the first three KICs (Climate-KIC, EIT ICT Labs and KIC InnoEnergy), new KICs focused on innovation for healthy living and active ageing, raw materials, added value manufacturing and food4future seem to have the potential to stimulate innovation in their respective domains.", "New programmes on access to finance carry the promise of reducing red tape for SMEs and, at the same time, bring the European Investment Fund closer to potential innovators through enhanced partnerships with local authorities or financial institutions.", "Further good news includes the earmarking of more structural funds for research and innovation in the 2014-2020 financial framework and the new Framework for State aid for Research & Development & Innovation (R&D&I), which is expected to enable public support to address market failures that may hamper the financing of R&D&I in Europe.", "So far, so good. However, the first steps of the Juncker Commission seem to have marked a change of direction, with innovation policy apparently losing traction compared to the prominence it had been given, at least formally, by the second Barroso Commission.", "Compared to the (only partly successful) past attempts to centralise and coordinate initiatives related to innovation, the Juncker Commission seems to believe in a greater fragmentation of innovation policy instruments, which now fall under a widely diverse set of DGs and agencies.", "Suffice it to say that the Joint Research Centre has been moved under the responsibility of DG Education.", "Moreover, the fact that the mandate letter sent to Carlos Moedas, the new Commissioner for Science, Research and Innovation, does not mention basic science as a priority has raised many eyebrows.", "And even the recent €315bn European Fund for Strategic Investments announced by Juncker does not reserve a clear or prominent role for R&D, despite the fact that it will be drawing funds for at least €2.8 billion from Horizon 2020.13", "Is this necessarily bad news for EU innovation policy? No, although important caveats apply. The main reason why the new course is not necessarily a step backwards is that the EFSI seems likely to focus mostly on pan-European infrastructure deployment.", "This has attracted criticism but is fully in line with the role of government in emerging innovation ecosystems: serving as the facilitator, in charge of creating the most viable conditions for innovative activity to take place.", "After all, the past years have not shown great value for the public spending at the EU level dedicated to research.", "Investments in infrastructure could end up having a more significant impact on entrepreneurship and innovation than an upfront allocation of funds to difficult-to-locate innovative activities.", "To be sure, this would only happen under very restrictive conditions. First, the quality of the projects that will be selected for funding through the EFSI will be essential, and the procedures that will be followed for project selection are not known in detail as of now.", "If the European Investment Bank ends up handling the selection of projects, this risks passing on to the EFSI project the ineffectiveness of the Bank in selecting valuable beneficiaries.", "Second, Horizon 2020 can be reformed in several respects to ensure even greater value for money. Among the most advisable changes would be the implementation of a policy to avoid fragmentation among platforms dedicated to the same (or similar) societal challenges, such as European Innovation Partnerships, Joint Technology Initiatives and Knowledge and Innovation Communities.", "In addition, initiatives on advanced manufacturing should be prioritised even more so than is already the case.", "While the planned KIC in this area is not anticipated to be ready before 2016, the German “Industry 4.0” initiative and the US advanced manufacturing initiative are already up and running.", "Third, a thorough reform of the EU education system is absolutely essential. For example, despite the 26 million unemployed European citizens, there are an estimated 900,000 vacant posts in the ICT industry, mostly in cloud computing, and the gap between supply and demand reportedly widens every month.", "Fourth, the upcoming review of the Europe 2020 strategy will be a unique opportunity to replace the current indicator, which focuses on spending three per cent of GDP on R&D, with a more meaningful, outcome-based indicator of innovation.", "It also offers the chance to merge or further coordinate the four key flagship initiatives that are most relevant to innovation (Innovation Union, Industrial Policy for the Globalization Age, New Skills for New Jobs, Digital Agenda) to concentrate direct action on a few pressing societal challenges, while simultaneously utilising indirect actions to create a fertile innovation ecosystem.", "The Latvian Presidency will have to finalise the proposed review in March 2015, hopefully with a strong emphasis on the innovation policy angle.14", "Fifth, infrastructure policy (inside and outside the EFSI) is key to the future of innovation, especially – but not exclusively – concerning internet connectivity.", "This is why renewed efforts have to be devoted to the deployment of ultra-fast broadband infrastructure in all EU member states.", "Insufficient connectivity, in the era of virtualised production and 3D printing, can exclude a country from the most thriving global value chains.", "Finally, there is a strong need to recognise that innovation is affected by many other EU policies that are not part of the innovation policy domain.", "These include regulatory reform, red tape reduction, and most importantly internal market policies such as competition law, public procurement legislation, standardisation and sector-specific regulation.", "As observed inter alia by Larouche and Schinkel, it seems that competition policy should be handled by the European Commission in a way that is innovation-compatible and should therefore place a greater emphasis on long-term dynamic efficiency than on the short-term static efficiency effects of market outcomes.15", "Only by working in all these directions will the new European Commission be able to boost innovation and entrepreneurship by developing a mix of policies that do not specifically mention any of the two words.", "Only then could the choice of a rather “thin” portfolio for Moedas and fewer ad hoc institutions for innovation eventually pay off.", "If this happens, it would put Europe back in a situation in which innovation is not a policy but rather an outcome.", "- 1 See e.g. http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_IP-11-692_en.htm.", "- 2 See e.g. M.

In 1997 the first agreement on the Kyoto Protocol was signed by many nations.", "The signature of the Protocol and later the negotiations on the targets legitimated the need for actions on a global scale to mitigate the potential effects of climate change.", "Although the debate continued, the development of technology solutions reflected in patenting activity in renewable energy technology increased significantly after the agreements on the Kyoto targets to limit the CO2 present in the atmosphere.", "Although there is still scepticism concerning climate change projections,16 the need for action to reduce CO2 emissions has entered in the discourse and policy agendas and thus gained legitimacy for the “urgent” need for action.", "Similarly, markets have reacted to the challenge and economic opportunities this brings for (global) business.", "With a time lag of just a few years following the increase of the patenting rate, the level of reported investment in the production and installation of renewable energy technologies has also significantly increased.17", "The business interest and economic impact are becoming clear from the large increase of capital flowing into energy-related innovations.", "For example, Ethical Markets Media reported $2.4 trillion of cumulative worldwide investment in eco-innovation during the period 2007-2011,18 while the expected cumulative investment by the year 2020 was estimated at $10 trillion.19 Innovations that address the climate challenge (e.g. in energy, mobility, water, etc.) are now creating new global markets, allowing smart specialisation in some regions and giving governments politically acceptable long-term horizons for policy action.", "Seen from the perspective of innovation, the process of tackling the climate change challenge reveals at least three important steps (a simplified version of the previous list):", "- reaching a shared understanding of the need for action, which requires a lot of fundamental research and connecting politics with science, and which in the meantime leads to a restructuring of the research field (new institutes, new forms of collaboration);", "- creating technological solutions, which may include unconventional approaches such as competitor companies sharing their patents in order to foster the development of solutions;", "- investment and market development, including the rise of new companies, shaping the necessary regulatory environment and new institutions.", "Before going into more detail about the role of Horizon 2020, two questions need to be posed. The first question is whether the climate change/energy challenge indeed provides a model for other challenges, such as healthy ageing, water, food or security.", "Climate change and energy is a societal challenge whose globally interdependent nature was more or less accepted from the beginning of discussions and research, even when most of its implications are unevenly felt across countries, regions and localities.", "Other challenges like health, water, food and security also have such global interdependencies, but so far national and regional political agendas have tended to dominate.", "The establishment of global research and innovation networks in science and technology can help to build an arena which links the local implications and potential solutions to the global dynamics.", "It can help to create an environment in which potential conflicts between regions and nations can be mediated.", "The strong and long-standing collaborative dynamics of global innovation networks related to energy, especially in the area of R&D, might have some lessons to offer to other policy areas.", "In the field of healthy ageing, we see broad international research networks appearing. The globally operating pharmaceutical companies might in principle play a role in extending such collaborations further into the field of innovation.", "Other challenges which have belonged to the realm of national and regional/local governments – sometimes for hundreds of years – will require an even stronger internationally collaborative research and innovation effort in order to turn them into global drivers for global solutions.", "Such a structuration process will not be easy. The implementation of the shared vision to face the grand challenges requires the capacity to create convergence, and it should enable the interoperation of complex multi-actor networks.", "It also requires a logic of systems integration that is often at odds with the decentralised decision making and management style presently dominant in national or sectoral approaches.", "Specifically in the case of Europe, the present political decentralisation tendencies may raise the barriers for an effective challenge-driven approach.", "The second question is if and how the challenge-driven approach helps Europe to make the transition to the next phase in global innovation and production systems.", "The international economic context has moved to a new, multipolar era in which the rules of the competitive game are being reset.", "Leading economies and newcomers in global markets (e.g. India, China, South Korea, Taiwan, Singapore, etc.) have mastered not only the know-how for cost-driven competition,20 but they also have become innovative in both traditional and in selected high-tech sectors.21 Global competition and new technologies drive the cores of innovation and production networks closer to consumption and closer to important markets.22", "The transition has to take place when governments in several advanced economies, and certainly in Europe, can no longer rely on a broad electorate’s confidence and on the legitimacy of their policy agendas to ensure the societal welfare, employment and growth.", "But the needs-driven notion of societal challenges offers the opportunity to articulate a structure of innovation and production in a new combination of global networking and local action.", "Such a new competitive landscape not only requires a significant restructuring of the global patterns of production, but the production of knowledge and innovation driven by societal challenges may help to build the arena in which actions can be taken.", "Thus, innovation will play an important role as a means for restructuring and for legitimation of new global production networks and markets.", "For Europe this transition starts with the implementation of Horizon 2020. The largest portion of the Horizon 2020 budget, almost 40 per cent (i.e. €31 billion) is dedicated to exploring and creating approaches and technologies with which to tackle the grand challenges.23 From a political economy perspective, the Europe 2020 strategy, underpinned by the notion of societal challenges, aims to:", "- develop and mature new competences, skills and technologies, as defined by specific programmes contributing to the solution of a societal challenge;", "- set up new institutions, standards and regulations supporting European industrial and market leadership;", "- create global consensus and shared visions that underpin the creation of new markets.", "The first point of this agenda and vision is reflected in programmes that together form Horizon 2020, and this includes a strong role for enabling competencies such as those developed under, for example, Factories of the Future, Future and Emerging Technologies, or the excellence-driven funding of the European Research Council.", "Such programmes directly or indirectly aim to tackle societal challenges, to underpin the building of competitive roles in global innovation networks and to set the grounds for global industrial leadership.", "The other two points are the topic of much broader policy actions. Closer to the market, the process will require the creation of new institutions that apply regulations and standards across industries and nations.", "Those firms or countries which manage to set the new standards and adapt or create their institutions according to the new business models required by the new rationale of bringing solutions to the societal challenges are likely to be best positioned in the restructured regional or global value networks.", "The period 2010-2020 can be considered a transitional phase in which the foundations for the period 2020-2050 are to be set.", "Such foundations include facing societal challenges and the new global geopolitical and competitive landscape.", "Developments in tackling the climate change and energy challenge and its structuration are now continuing at an increasing pace (e.g. setting standards, technological competition, varied national support, new collaboration models, etc.).", "European companies play a major role in this process. Competition is moving on from present markets to the creation of future ones.", "The precompetitive activities are not only focusing on R&D and innovation but also on norms and institution-building.", "In this sense, the climate change and energy model seems a promising approach, as it provides a tractable example of the dynamics of the massive alignment of vision and multilateral agendas akin to global issues.", "The potential economic and social impact, as already shown by the rise of the energy markets, is large.", "Learning the lessons offered by this model and its application in other areas of grand challenges may yield similar outcomes.", "But at the same time, it should be noted that one cannot expect quick results. Solutions will have to be moderated in a lengthy structuration process.", "The period 2010-2020 should be seen a preparatory period where a broad scope of pre-competitive activity is taking place.", "Following the timing and logic offered by the climate change and energy model and the Kondratiev waves of economic development, we could expect that global markets and economic expansion are to take off well beyond 2020.", "- 1 This is extensively discussed in European Commission: High Level Expert Group on Key Enabling Technologies, Final Report, June 2011.", "- 2 See http://ec.europa.eu/programmes/horizon2020/en/h2020-section/societal-challenges.", "- 3 It should also be noted that demand-driven innovation is not new.

efficacy of this combination.", "The strength of data for the predictive role of RAS in EGFR MAb (both with regard to efficacy in the KRAS WT setting and lack of efficacy in the KRAS MT setting) means that future trials of EGFR MAb should mandate RAS testing and include RAS WT genotype as an inclusion criterion.", "All future clinical trials should measure and report quality of life.", "The question of optimal sequencing ‐ of EGFR MAb and bevacizumab, as well as of different chemotherapeutic regimens and the partnering of the two ‐ should continue to be investigated.", "The role of additional therapies in reversing EGFR MAb resistance (e.g. the addition of vemurafenib or other B‐Raf proto‐oncogene, serine/threonine kinase (BRAF)‐targeting agents to EGFR MAb in BRAF MT patients) is incompletely defined, and deserves further investigation.", "The emergence of newer data may influence future research regarding optimisation of EGFR MAb use in metastatic colorectal cancer.", "Recent data presented at American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) 2016 regarding Venook CALGB 80405 2014 suggests that cetuximab (compared to bevacizumab) may have worse efficacy for right‐sided primaries but better efficacy in left‐sided primaries.", "This may be related to molecular differences between the two locations such as CpG island methylator phenotype (CIMP) and BRAF mutation status.", "Future research regarding the impact of these factors on the efficacy of cetuximab, as well as the molecular correlations of right‐sided and left‐sided colon cancer, should be performed to optimise benefit to patients from EGFR MAb use.", "Given the lack of benefit from EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors in currently published trials, it is questionable as to whether future research into

Drugs and ICER’s Orphan Drug Assessment", "Amgen would like to take the opportunity to comment on ICER’s plans to develop an Orphan Drug Value Assessment Framework and pricing methodology for orphan drugs.", "This paper is in response to the Technical Briefing paper and Orphan Drug Pricing Summit that occurred on May 31st, 2017.", "In the US, the FDA regulatory framework has special provisions for orphan diseases, which provide incentives to address the significant societal burden and high-unmet need of patients with rare, disabling, burdensome, and almost uniformly fatal conditions, if left untreated.", "The US government recognized the need for orphan drugs to have special provisions by establishing the Orphan Drug Act (ODA) in 1983, which provides incentives for development of drugs to treat orphan diseases, which it defined shortly after passage as those that affect 200,000 or fewer individuals.1 Orphan diseases affect 25-30 million Americans today, and are often characterized by a “diagnostic odyssey” of delayed and incorrect diagnoses before an accurate diagnosis can be made, paired with significant psychological and economic stress for the patient and their family.2 Orphan diseases are devastating due to their rapid progression, reduced life expectancy, and significant disability, often manifesting in infants and young children.3", "These diseases also have a large impact on caregivers’ quality of life and economic productivity.4", "Despite progress resulting from the 1983 Orphan Drug Act, orphan drug development innovation needs to be fostered and accelerated.", "- Today there are approximately 7,000 orphan diseases of which there are only 625 FDA designated/approved orphan drug treatments.5,6", "- Even by conservative standards, at a rate of 17 drugs approved on average per year, it would take 375 years for researchers to find treatments for the millions of remaining patients.7", "- This is a pace that is unacceptable to those without treatment and speaks to the crucial imperative to accelerate discovery, development, and FDA approval for new orphan disease treatments.", "ICER’s goal to set prices based on willingness to pay (WTP) thresholds will almost assuredly have unintended negative consequences on the pace of crucial scientific research and patient treatment access.", "- Relying on price thresholds similar to those seen in other countries is not only inappropriate to the US system, but also well studied.", "- Researchers including those at Stanford, observe that price thresholds would slow drug innovation by 23-32 percent with as much as a 60 percent reduction in Research and Development (R&D) early stage projects.8,9", "- Even holding constant the success rate of orphan drug approvals at lower levels of investment, this could add a further century to the current pace of orphan drug development.", "- This is at a time where half of those with orphan diseases are children, an estimated 30 percent of children who have an orphan disease will pass away before their fifth birthday, and only one in 10 orphan disease patients has a viable treatment for their condition.10", "- Today, 95 percent of orphan diseases lack FDA-approved treatments and for the remaining five percent who are fortunate to have treatments, the small number of patients and their caregivers must fight and/or struggle for access to these treatments in an insurance system designed for more common illnesses.", "- It is worth noting that willingness to pay thresholds have a measured effect not only on R&D but also on patient access.", "In countries that have orphan and ultra-orphan thresholds such as Scotland, there has been an observed 1/3 fewer orphan drugs approved for reimbursement.11", "Although orphan drugs make up $68.7 billion in spend per year in the US, their ability to alleviate the grave tangible and intangible effects of orphan disease is staggering.12", "- Taking the average annual costs in published data from a systematic review of 77 studies, total annual costs for orphan diseases could be conservatively estimated at $2 trillion dollars per year with orphan drugs making up only 4% of this cost.13", "- Moreover, orphan diseases drain approximately $324 billion in lost productivity costs to patients and caregivers and these are silent costs that are not reflected in ICER’s Value Framework, nor have they been considered in ICER’s past assessments of orphan drugs.14,15", "- For the 1 in 10 patients who have access to a treatment, orphan drugs can considerably offset total costs that would have been incurred without treatment, as measured in healthier Americans living more productive lives.", "- Moreover, orphan drugs contribute $149 billion to the economy and for every dollar spent in the development of an orphan drug, there is a return of 2.4 dollars to the economy every year.16", "Not only do orphan drugs have a net positive effect on costs and economic return to the economy, ICER’s claim that orphan drugs are putting drug budgets in peril is categorically untrue.", "- Drug budgets as a percent of US total National Health Expenditure have not changed since 1960 and orphan drugs as a percentage of this currently represent 2% of all national health expenditure", "- This is projected to rise 0.5% by 2022 and for this small increase, patients who otherwise would have no other treatment have a chance to live a healthy and productive life.17,18,19,20", "- We strongly support ICER’s goal of helping healthcare become more sustainable but recommend that ICER look to macroeconomic healthcare expenditure drivers whereby National Health Expenditure, by the estimates of CMS is affected by prices of medical services (supply-side drivers) and use and intensity of medical goods and services (demand side drivers) with the prices of medical services projected to drive expenditure over the next 8 years.21", "- Concentrating on orphan drug expenditure will have no impact on overall healthcare expenditure, nor will it help public or private insurers materially contain even short-term healthcare expenditures.", "- Instead this will result in a deleterious effect of loss of life and welfare for very vulnerable individuals, half of which are children, who have had the unfortunate consequence of being afflicted with an orphan disease.", "At 25-30 million, the number of patients suffering from orphan disease is a third of the total population with cardiovascular disease,22 about the same size as the population in the US who are currently living with diabetes,23 and two times more than those living beyond a cancer diagnosis (many of which are orphan diseases themselves).24", "Yet despite these large numbers, the drug development constellation is infinitely more complex due to lack of data and information in a field where most of what we have learned about orphan disease in the last five years completely eclipses everything we have learned over the last five centuries.", "ICER’s paternalistic, one size fits all, inflexible approach could negatively affect one in every 10 Americans who are affected by an orphan disease.25 At this time, these patients most need hope, dignity, and respect enhanced by access to valuable treatments for an equal chance at achieving a healthy life as everyone who does not suffer from an orphan disease.", "What these patients do not need is to be marginalized down to a “budget impact” or defined by willingness to pay thresholds and acronyms that encompass quality of life such as the QALY (quality adjusted life year), but that only health economists can explain.", "Willingness to pay and the evaluation of orphan drugs is an area of research that is incredibly underdeveloped both in the body of existing research and in stakeholder engagement.", "It is imperative that ICER have the appropriate discussions about the willingness to pay for orphan drugs in the US with patients, providers and policy-makers as well as ensuring that not only stakeholder consensus exists but also far more scientific and policy research from which to draw upon.", "In effect, ICER’s current trajectory of assessing orphan drugs with an adapted version of their Value Framework has the associated risk of having a significant negative welfare impact on current and future generations of orphan disease sufferers.", "Moreover, ICER’s claim that orphan drugs are putting drug budgets in peril is not grounded in real world evidence nor will ICER’s assessment of orphan drugs have any impact on the growth of National Health Expenditure.", "We urge ICER to consider and incorporate the below recommendations to help align its role and work with its publically stated mission.", "1) Standard value assessments are inappropriate for orphan conditions", "Orphan drug value assessment methodology is in nascent stages and current approaches cannot capture the comparative clinical effectiveness or net health benefit of new treatments.", "Orphan drugs have highly variable and unique circumstances specific to each disease and face methodological data constraints,26 including varying levels of available evidence, small study populations, quantification of quality of life benefit, rarely measured spillover effects in families, variation in cost-offsets that determine cost-effectiveness, high burden of illness, lack of appropriate comparator treatments, etc.", "ICER should recognize that heterogeneity in treatment options and characteristics of orphan disease patients cannot be addressed by a ‘one-size-fits-all’ assessment approach, and attempting to do so undermines the full value of these treatments.27", "Orphan drugs provide significant benefits and advantages that often go unmeasured and are easily minimized in a traditional value assessment; hence, a flexible approach with added safeguards is needed.", "Contextual factors receive no quantifiable consideration in cost-effectiveness ratios employed in ICER’s traditional value framework, which is a shortfall in its application for common drugs that would be even more challenging for orphan drugs.", "The economic and social costs from orphan diseases, including current healthcare expenditures, loss of wages, and loss of productivity are an estimated 2 trillion per year.28 Orphan drugs can help reduce these costs—especially the economic costs—by increasing the ability of the medical profession to efficiently manage these orphan diseases.29 Many costs and benefits that patients experience cannot be measured but must be considered including the benefit of ‘buying time’ as new treatments allow patients to survive until the development of those treatments that will cure them.", "The significant impact of orphan diseases also extends to the family and caregivers’ quality of life and earnings.30 Patient and caregiver out-of-pocket costs and lost productivity from inability to work constitute a significant amount of total costs in orphan indications, but these have not been considered in ICER’s Frameworks.31", "This hard-wires an inherent bias towards health insurers and is blind to both measurable and immeasurable costs that orphan disease sufferers and their families/caregivers incur.", "2) Orphan drugs should ethically never be subjected to fixed willingness to pay (WTP) thresholds due to contextual and ethical considerations", "Subjecting orphan drugs to a value framework with fixed thresholds, such as ICER’s, could negatively affect patients with orphan diseases by decreasing access to therapies in the short-term and discouraging orphan disease therapeutic innovation in the long-term.", "Society’s goal is not limited to maximizing population health gains, but also ensuring fairness in giving all patients a meaningful chance for health gain.32 Applying a cost-benefit ratio for an orphan disease treatment is contrary to an egalitarian/utilitarian approach (maximizing equity for individuals) 33 and could be disastrous for those who suffer from an orphan disease: this approach would prioritize the least costly patients rather than the sickest of patients who lack a sufficient voice in the healthcare system.", "Many HTAs globally have recognized the ethical, equity and social justice challenges of applying a willingness to pay threshold to orphan diseases.", "As such, many of these HTAs have special processes and special funding mechanisms for orphan diseases.", "For example, Sweden considers the ‘human dignity principle’, which essentially combines a recognition that all citizens should be treated equally, and the “needs-solidarity principle,” which strives to optimize clinical benefit based on individual patient need.34 Perhaps more importantly in the US “[b]efore the Affordable Care Act (ACA) was enacted in 2010, rare disease patients could not access health care coverage due to discriminatory insurance practices, limited Medicaid eligibility, and debilitating cost-sharing.", "”35 Imposing a willingness-to-pay (WTP) threshold for orphan drugs will not address the needs of the complex US Healthcare System and may once again jeopardize our societal desire for equity and justice in the insurance system36 because it lacks scientific basis and is inconsistent with the principles of population insurance and risk pooling and will shift more cost to patients.", "ICER’s Framework uses willingness to pay thresholds and panel voting to categorize treatments as low, medium or high value for money.37 This is pejorative from the perspective of patients that have only one option for treatment and are uniquely positioned to judge if a treatment is of high value.", "Moreover, ICER sets its goal in its Value Framework of “sustainable access to high-value care for all patients”.38 Whilst ICER may be able to evaluate the evidence for a new product, it cannot take on a role that defines treatment value on behalf of the patient or US society.", "This positions ICER in an unintended but nevertheless empirically discriminatory role against patients who suffer from orphan diseases.", "There is no scientific foundation for the use of WTP thresholds in orphan disease. An ICER willingness to pay threshold for orphan drugs in the US is irreconcilable with the need for a different evaluation process, requiring wider considerations of orphan disease and treatment experiences from a multi-stakeholder perspective, balanced with the societal desire for fairness and equity in the insurance system.", "No single cost-effectiveness threshold for any given assessed technology can be derived for the complex US healthcare system.", "Even if this were possible, it would need to be set by elected US government officials, following well-recognized and standard, reproducible methodologies with transparent public processes, rather than by ICER.", "Use of willingness to pay thresholds based on the quality adjusted life year pose methodological challenges in orphan disease.", "QALY’s suffer significant shortfalls if applied to orphan disease including (1) QALYs cannot address the heterogeneity in treatment options; (2) QALYs cannot be derived for very young or very old populations; (3) Caregiver QoL/QALYs usually are not considered; and (4) Patients with lower QALYs whose lives are extended will have overall higher/unfavorable incremental cost per QALYs than patients with mild disease.", "Introducing national willingness-to-pay or budget impact thresholds as price ceilings for orphan drugs is counter to the principle on which the US Orphan Drug Act is based, and will lead to counter-productive delays in innovation, slowing the supply of new, desperately needed treatments and potentially restricting patient access to available treatments.39 Orphan drugs have highly variable and unique circumstances specific to each disease and extensive confounders (e.g., small study population, quantification of quality of life benefit, rarely measured spillover effects in families, variation in cost-offsets, burden of illness, accelerated approval, etc.).40 When assessing the value of orphan drugs, the approach in the US, given its multi-payer and often fragmented system, needs to be flexible and without a fixed threshold, leaving the decision to the budget-holder in a manner that preserves physician decision-making and patient choice.", "ICER should not attempt to set national thresholds for the assessment of orphan drugs, instead focus on serving as an advisor that facilitates robust dialogues around the evidence to inform decision-makers.", "ICER should carefully evaluate the possible impact of willingness-to-pay thresholds in the US through the lens of how it could delay access to innovative, lifesaving treatments in orphan disease.", "The unmet needs in orphan diseases remains high, yet, experts from the orphan disease community assert that financial incentives today are not great enough to catalyze the necessary drug development required to meet this unmet need.41,42,43 Companies invest to the point where their anticipated marginal efficiency for R&D is equivalent to their marginal cost of capital and at lower prices, companies reduce their investments due to lower returns.44 Price cuts and even the threat of a price cut materially reduces pharmaceutical R&D investment.45,46 Artificially induced price setting by ICER will revive the worst aspects of orphan drug market failure, by diminishing the beneficial effects of extensive legislation designed to partially offset these failures.", "Moreover, experiences from other countries suggest that health technology assessment approaches similar to ICER’s would have the net effect of dramatically limiting patient access to newly approved drugs during product launches.47 Countries that use rigid willingness to pay criteria experience a correlation with both less and delayed access to cancer drugs with lower associated survival rates.48", "3) ICER’s attempt to synthesize a new orphan drug category, ‘ultra-orphan drugs’ and separate this from orphan drugs disregards the plight and unmet needs of all orphan drug disease patients", "Currently there is no definition or rationale to define subsets of orphan disease. ICER’s move in this direction essentially redefines the criteria set out in the Orphan Drug Act and will leave many patients with non-ultra orphan diseases disadvantaged.", "Given a 38% total US population growth since 1984, the ODA definition of diseases ‘affecting fewer than 200,000 patients’ is over 30 years out of date, already reducing the eligible population by 75,000.49,50 Further narrowing this would marginalize those who do not meet the criteria for so called ultra-orphan diseases and would likely result in the delay of a drug or complete absence of its development without positive R&D and appropriate pricing incentives.", "Market factors determining demand, net present value and return on investment mean that drugs affecting fewer patients are priced higher than those for diseases with larger patient numbers.", "Evaluate Pharma demonstrates a nearly linear effect such that those drugs for diseases with less than 10,000 patients are priced higher than those for diseases affecting 60,000 patients or more.51 It is important to note that the original ODA legislation did not include a prevalence number but was established for drugs that would not be economically viable to develop without added incentives.52 These incentives include being able to command a price in the market that allows a given company to recoup its investment not only reflected in the direct R&D for the development of a product but the years of prior investment in a drug’s wider discovery platform.", "In fact, it is society that indirectly benefits from the advancements in scientific knowledge that often result from orphan disease research – an element that is not captured in standard cost-effectiveness analyses such as ICER’s.", "4) Most cancers are orphan diseases and attempts to carve out oncology from orphan drugs would have a long-term impact on current and future generations of cancer patients", "It is too early to classify the majority of orphan cancers by molecular characteristics. Although there are some easily identifiable orphan subgroups within larger populations of more common cancers, e.g., triple negative cancer, for other cancers more research is required to classify some orphan cancers by molecular characteristics.", "Cancer is undergoing a renaissance resulting from the sequencing of the human genome applied within population medicine such that treatment decisions in cancer are increasingly determined by the dominant molecular characterization of a given patient’s tumor, predicting factors such as aggressiveness, likelihood of metastasis and treatment response.", "This has led to an exciting number of targeted therapies for orphan indications resulting from a molecular understanding of cancer biology.", "The effect on a mutation or biomarker on a drug’s mechanism of action, biomarker level of expression and tumor heterogeneity often means that there may not always be a clean line in defining a cancer.", "Unfortunately, this has not changed the fact that many cancers and cancer subsets still have very grim prognoses (e.g., pancreatic cancer, AML, Triple X breast cancer).", "Efforts to classify cancer drugs for populations less than 200,000 as ‘not orphan drugs’ denies cancer patients of benefiting from the Orphan Drug Act.", "Unlike several decades ago, much of pharmaceutical research today is highly dispersed and networked. Biotechnology companies who lead in cancer innovation are in competition to secure angel and venture funding in the hundreds of millions of dollars to get to proof of concept for a given therapy.53 In 2014 alone, 288 deals and $3.8 billion in investments were made in the biopharmaceutical industry.54", "The US dominates this area, accounting for nearly three-quarters of worldwide venture capital investments in biotech, with Europe far behind accounting for only 23% of overall venture capital investment.55 A 10 percent reduction in cancer drug prices has been shown to decrease pharmaceutical innovation by 5-6 percent.56 Price cut threats and price uncertainty affecting the decision to invest, such as those price ceilings that ICER recommends has the biggest and most unnoticed affect on biotech funding for new cancer drugs.", "Orphan legislation is a critical aid to these small companies because it allows them to attract more investment and offset the cost of drug discovery, research and development.", "Orphan diseases present extraordinarily complex contextual, ethical and resource issues that cannot be answered by a ‘one-size-fits all’ value assessment framework.", "As recommended by the recent ISPOR Special Task Force on Value Frameworks, ICER’s standard approach for the assessment of net health benefit, cost-effectiveness analysis, and potential budget impact needs to change for all disease, but most acutely for orphan disease.57", "These inflexible approaches will result in reduced access to currently approved orphan drugs and negative impacts to the development of future drugs, impacting the sickest and most vulnerable of patients.", "ICER’s statement “The opportunity cost of supporting the use of ultra-orphan drugs necessitates that patients with a more common disease, for which a cost-effective treatment is available, are denied treatment” is in direct contrast to the intent of the ODA legislation, articulated by President Reagan, “From an economic perspective, groups that small do not now justify the kind of research expenditures that companies must make.", "The bill that I am signing today helps to cure that problem and consequently, we hope, some of the diseases as well.”58", "One-dimensional, paternalistic approaches to the evaluation of drugs for orphan disease put patients in the position of being an ‘economic drain’ on society rather than inspiring their hope for the future.", "Orphan drugs have a minimal impact on budgets and are not the huge cost-drivers that some claim, representing only 2% of US healthcare expenditures, even before consideration of the significant personal costs that patients and their families incur, and that many new drugs will offset such as the financial impact on families and caregivers related to both medical appointments and wider management costs including time.", "ICER suggests that the subtraction of orphan drug treatments from patients would allow for treatment for more common conditions.", "At the core of this debate, we should not lose sight of the dire, intangible and silent costs of orphan diseases, which are responsible for 35% of all deaths in the first year of life.59 We cannot consider these merely as insurance ‘price-per-members’ or cost drivers, but human beings who deserve dignity, respect and society’s special consideration without which they will have no chance for a healthy life.", "I am pleased to sign into law today the Orphan Drug Act. Over the past century, the United States -- largely through innovative pioneering by private industry and medical researchers in universities -- has led the world in developing new drugs that have saved millions of lives.", "That is a gift to mankind we can be very proud of. Yet the sad fact remains that many diseases still cripple or kill hundreds of thousands of Americans, as well as citizens of other countries, because no drugs have yet been developed.", "These diseases include cystic fibrosis, Wilson's disease, myoclonus, Tourette's syndrome, and certain neuromuscular disorders and cardiac arrhythmias.", "Statistically, they are rare; yet that is small comfort for those afflicted. The cost of discovering and developing a new drug is often staggering.", "By definition, an orphan drug is one that treats a disease that affects 200,000 or fewer individuals -- and, from an economic perspective, groups that small do not now justify the kind of research expenditures that companies must make.", "The bill that I am signing today helps to cure that problem and consequently, we hope, some of the diseases as well.", "The bill provides incentives for the private sector to develop drugs to treat these rare diseases…I am gladly signing the orphan drug bill.", "I only wish with the stroke of this pen I could also decree that the pain and heartache of people who suffer from these diseases would cease.", "- Department of Health and Human Services.

Concern that the financial crisis was worsening, and might lead to another Great Depression, led to a sharp decrease in stock prices and to a dramatic fall in consumer and corporate confidence around the world.", "This happened as a result of a buildup during the preceding good times of underlying conditions that helped shape the crisis, plus the triggering of amplification mechanisms that dramatically boosted its impact.", "Blanchard identified two related, but distinct, mechanisms: first, the sale of assets to satisfy liquidity runs by investors and, second, the sale of assets to reestablish capital ratios.", "Together with the initial conditions, these mechanisms helped create the worst global recession since the 1930s.", "The trigger for the crisis was the decline in housing prices in the United States. But the initial losses from the subprime crisis were not huge in comparison with a measure such as U.S. stock market capitalization and were greatly overshadowed by subsequent world stock market declines (see chart).", "However, over the years, the stage was being set for a much larger crisis. Blanchard cited four preconditions: the underestimation of risk contained in newly issued assets; the opacity of the derived securities on the balance sheets of financial institutions; the interconnection of financial institutions, both within and across countries; and the high degree of leverage of the financial system as a whole.", "Assets were created, bought, and sold that appeared much less risky than they truly were. With the expectation of stable or rising housing prices, most subprime mortgages appeared relatively riskless: the value of a mortgage might be high relative to the price of a house, but that imbalance would slowly disappear over time as prices increased.", "In retrospect, the fallacy of this proposition was in its premise: if housing prices actually declined, many mortgages would exceed the value of the house, leading to defaults and foreclosures.", "Why did the people who took on these mortgages, and the institutions that held them, so underestimate the true risk?", "Many explanations have been given, and many potential culprits have been named. Each of these explanations contains a grain of truth, but only a grain.", "Blanchard said he believed that the fundamental explanation is more general. History teaches that benign economic environments often lead to credit booms and to the creation of marginal assets and the issuance of marginal loans.", "Borrowers and lenders look at recent historical distributions of returns and become more optimistic, indeed too optimistic, about future returns.", "The environment was benign in the 2000s in most of the world, with sustained growth and low interest rates.", "And, looking in particular at U.S. housing prices, both borrowers and lenders could point to the fact that housing prices had increased every year since 1991, and had done so even during the recession of 2001.", "Securitization led to complex and hard-to-value assets on the balance sheets of financial institutions.", "Securitization had started much earlier, but ramped up in the past decade. In mid-2008, more than 60 percent of all U.S. mortgages were securitized—pooled to form mortgage-backed securities—and the income streams from these securities were separated (“tranched’’) to offer riskier flows to some investors and less risky flows to others.", "Why did securitization take off in such a way? Because it was, and still is, a major improvement in risk allocation and a fundamentally healthy development.", "Indeed, looking across countries before the crisis, many (including Blanchard) concluded that the U.S. economy would withstand a decrease in housing prices better than most economies: the shock would be absorbed by a large set of investors, rather than by just a few financial institutions, and thus would be much easier to absorb.", "This argument ignored two aspects that turned out to be important. The first was that, with complexity, came opacity.", "Although it was possible to assess the value of simple mortgage pools, it was harder to assess the value of the derived tranched securities, and even harder to assess the value of the securities derived from tranches of derived securities.", "Thus, worries about the original mortgages translated into a large degree of uncertainty about the value of the derived securities.", "And, in that environment, the fact that the securities were held by a large set of financial institutions implied that this considerable uncertainty affected a large number of balance sheets in the economy.", "Securitization and globalization led to increasing interconnection of financial institutions, both within and across countries.", "One of the early stories of the crisis was the surprisingly large exposure of some regional German banks to U.S. subprime loans.", "But the reality goes far beyond this one example. Foreign claims by banks from the five major advanced economies increased from $6.3 trillion in 2000 to $22 trillion by June 2008.", "In mid-2008, claims by these banks on emerging market countries alone exceeded $4 trillion. Think of what this implies if, for any reason, those banks decided to cut back their foreign exposure, as is happening now.", "Leverage increased within the financial system. The final key initial condition was the increase in leverage.", "Financial institutions financed their portfolios with less and less capital, thus increasing the rate of return on that capital.", "What were the underlying reasons? Certainly optimism and the underestimation of risk were at play. Another important factor was the number of regulatory holes.", "Banks were allowed to reduce their capital requirement by moving assets off their balance sheets in so-called structured investment vehicles.", "In 2006, the value of the off-balance-sheet assets of Citigroup, $2.1 trillion—exceeded the value of the assets on the balance sheet, $1.8 trillion.", "The problem went far beyond banks. For example, at the end of 2006, “monoline insurers,’’ which insured a particular risk—such as default on municipal bonds—and operated outside the perimeter of regulation, had capital equal to $34 billion to back insurance claims against assets valued at more than $3 trillion.", "The implications of high leverage for the crisis were straightforward. If, for any reason, the value of the assets became lower and more uncertain, then the higher the leverage, the higher the probability that capital would be wiped out and institutions would become insolvent.", "The larger crisis is the result of two mechanisms that amplified the initial crisis: the inability of some banks to finance themselves and the effects of capital adequacy requirements for banks.", "The first amplification mechanism is the modern version of bank runs. In traditional bank runs during the Great Depression, it was the depositors who took their money out of the banks.", "Two changes have taken place since then. First, in most countries, depositors are for the most part insured, so they have little incentive to run to the bank.", "And banks and other financial institutions finance themselves largely in money markets, through short-term “wholesale funding.’’", "Modern runs are no longer literal runs: what happens is institutions perceived to be at risk can no longer finance themselves on the money markets.", "The result is the same as in the old bank runs: faced with a decrease in their ability to borrow, institutions have to sell assets.", "To the extent that this is a macroeconomic phenomenon, there may be few deep-pocket investors willing to buy assets.", "If, in addition, the value of the assets is especially difficult for outside investors to assess, the assets are likely to sell at “fire-sale prices,’’ prices below the expected present value of the payments on the asset.", "This, in turn, implies that the sale of the assets by one institution further contributes to a decrease in the value of all similar assets, not only on the seller’s balance sheet, but on the balance sheets of all the institutions that hold these assets.", "This, in turn, reduces their capital, forcing them to sell assets, and so on.", "The amplification mechanism is at work, and it is easy to see how the size of the amplification is determined by initial conditions: to the extent that the assets are more opaque and thus difficult to value, the increase in uncertainty will be larger, leading to a higher perceived risk of solvency, and thus to a higher probability of runs.", "For the same reasons, finding outside investors to buy these assets will be more difficult, and the fire-sale discount will be larger.", "To the extent that securitization leads to exposure of a larger set of institutions, more institutions will be at risk of a run.", "And finally, to the extent that institutions are more leveraged, that is, have less capital relative to assets to start with, the probability of insolvency will rise, again increasing the probability of runs.", "As has been seen, all these factors were very much in evidence at the start of the crisis, which is why this amplification mechanism has been particularly strong.", "The second amplification mechanism comes from financial institutions’ need to maintain an adequate capital ratio.", "Faced with a decrease in the value of their assets, and thus lower capital, financial institutions need to improve their capital ratio, either to satisfy regulatory requirements or to satisfy investors that they are taking measures to decrease the risk of insolvency.", "In principle, they then have a choice. They can either get additional funds from outside investors or deleverage, decreasing the size of their balance sheets by selling some of their assets or reducing their lending.", "In a macroeconomic crisis, finding additional private capital is likely to be difficult, for the reasons cited earlier: there may be few deep-pocket investors willing to put up funds.", "And to the extent that the assets held by the financial institutions are difficult to value, investors will be reluctant to put their funds in institutions that hold them.", "In that situation, the only option for these institutions is to sell some of their assets. The same mechanism then goes into effect: the sale of assets leads to fire-sale prices, affecting the balance sheets of all the institutions that hold them, leading to further sales, and so on.", "And, again, opacity, connectedness, and leverage all imply more amplification.", "The two mechanisms are distinct. Theoretically, runs can happen even in the absence of any initial decrease in the value of assets.", "This is the well-known multiplicity of equilibria: if funding stops, assets must be liquidated at fire-sale prices, justifying the stop in funding in the first place.", "But runs are more likely, the higher the doubts about the value of the assets. Theoretically, firms may want to take measures to reestablish their capital ratio, even if they have no short-term funding problem and do not face runs.", "The two mechanisms interact, however, in many ways. A financial institution subject to a run may, instead of selling assets, cut credit to another financial institution, which may in turn be forced to sell assets.", "One of the channels through which the crisis has moved from advanced economies to emerging market economies has been through cuts in credit lines from financial institutions in advanced economies to their foreign subsidiaries, forcing them in turn to sell assets or cut credit to domestic borrowers.", "In short, underestimation of risk, opacity, interconnection, and leverage, all combined to create the perfect (financial) storm.", "After Blanchard gave this lecture, other amplification mechanisms further combined to transform the financial turmoil into an even bigger macroeconomic storm.", "Blanchard, Olivier, 2008, The Crisis: Basic Mechanisms and Appropriate Policies (Munich: Center for Economic Studies)."]}

These reasons include:", "Business valuation is a critical component to your estate or business succession planning. Your business may be your largest asset, and if you plan to engage in either one of these types of planning, at some point you will need to determine the taxable value of your business interest.", "An incorrect value (i.e., one that is underestimated) could cause you to miss out on tax-saving strategies, while a value that is inflated could result in an investment of time and money in unnecessary planning.", "Perhaps a key reason to be concerned about determining the taxable value of your business is the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), which is always on the lookout for sales at below and even above fair market value.", "If you sell something for less than the fair market value of business, the IRS could deem the transaction a combination sale and gift and charge you gift tax on the difference between the value you received and the value the IRS calculated.", "Likewise, a sale at above fair market value could be deemed a gift (subject to gift tax) from the buyer to you.", "The fair market value of your business bears an important and direct relationship to the amount of tax you will owe, whether it be capital gains tax resulting from a sale, gift tax on shares you have given away, or estate tax on property you own at your death.", "If the value determined by the IRS is different than the value your tax was calculated on, you (or your estate) could be liable for additional tax.", "Why A Valuation Might Be Needed?

In some cases, it is used to refer to fair market value, fair value, investment value, or even some other type of value.", "Sometimes it is used to refer to the analysis of an investment banker, security analyst, or financial manager or analyst.", "The point is, this term has several meanings and interpretations, so it is very important that any valuation including this term have a very specific definition of its usage.", "A going concern value considers factors specific to the business, both physical and intangible. Consideration is given to the existing infrastructure, goodwill, reputation, trained workforce, licensing, and/or plant capabilities of the business.", "The valuation is based on the assumption that the business will continue to be a viable operating entity and as such should bear a higher value than the sum of the values of its collective assets.", "Liquidation value is a determination of the proceeds (net of selling costs) realized if a company ceased operating and sold off the assets.", "There are two types of liquidation, and the specific situation will affect the valuation. An orderly liquidation involves the sale of assets over a period of time to maximize proceeds.", "A forced liquidation, on the other hand, means selling the assets as quickly as possible (often by auction) and often at a lower value than might otherwise be achieved if more time were available.", "Book value is an accounting term that can apply to a specific asset or an entire company. An asset's book value equals the historical cost minus any allowances for depreciation, amortization, or unrealized losses.", "The book value for a company is the shareholders' equity, calculated from the balance sheet as the excess of total assets over total liabilities.", "How Do You Determine The Taxable Value Of Your Business?", "It's important to find a qualified appraiser.

PROCEDURES FOR DETERMINATION OF FAIR MARKET VALUE.", "Three basic methods a taxpayer may use to determine the fair market value of inventory are the replacement cost method, the comparative sales method, and the income method.", ".01 Replacement Cost Method. The replacement cost method generally provides a good indication of fair market value if inventory is readily replaceable in a wholesale or retail business, but generally should not be used in establishing the fair market value of the work in process or finished goods of a manufacturing concern.", "In valuing a bulk inventory of raw materials or goods purchased for resale under this method, the determination of the replacement cost of the individual items should be only a base or starting point.", "This base amount must be adjusted for factors that are generally relevant. For example, a willing purchaser might be expected to pay (and a willing seller might be expected to demand) a price for inventory that would compensate the seller not only for the current replacement cost, but also for a fair return on expenditures in accumulating and preparing the inventory for distribution.", "Thus, an amount equal to the fair value of the related costs that the taxpayer would have incurred in acquiring and accumulating the same quantity of goods had the goods been purchased separately (e.g., purchasing, handling, transportation, and off-site storage costs) should be added to the base amount.", "Additionally, in valuing a particular inventory under this method, other factors may be relevant. For example, a well balanced inventory available to fill customers' orders in the ordinary course of business may have a fair market value in excess of its cost of replacement because it provides a continuity of business, whereas an inventory containing obsolete merchandise unsuitable for customers may have a fair market value of less than the cost of replacement.", ".02 Comparative Sales Method. The comparative sales method utilizes the actual or expected selling prices of finished goods to customers in the ordinary course of business as the base amount that must be adjusted for factors that are generally relevant in determining the fair market value of the inventory.", "The inventory to be valued may represent a larger quantity than the normal trading volume. The expected selling price is a valid starting point only if the inventory is expected to be used to fill customers' orders in the ordinary course of business.", "If the expected selling price is used as a basis for valuing finished goods inventory, the base amount must be adjusted for relevant factors, including:", "(1) the time that would be required to dispose of this inventory;", "(2) the expenses that would be expected to be incurred in the disposition, for example, all costs of disposition, applicable discounts (including those for quantity), sales commissions, and freight and shipping charges; and", "(3) a profit commensurate with the amount of investment in the assets and the degree of risk. (This analysis should include (but is not limited to) an evaluation of risks of possible changes in style/design, changes in price levels, increased competition, possible adverse economic conditions, the fact that the inventory to be valued may represent a larger quantity than the normal trading volume, etc.).", ".03 Income Method. The income method, when applied to fair market value determinations for finished goods, recognizes that finished goods must generally be valued in a profit motivated business.", "As the amount of inventory may be large in relation to normal trading volume, the highest and best use of the inventory will be to provide for a continuity of the marketing operation of the going business.", "Additionally, the finished goods inventory will usually provide the only source of revenue of an acquired business during the period it is being used to fill customers' orders.", "The historical financial data of an acquired company can be used to determine the amount that could be attributed to finished goods in order to pay all costs of disposition and provide a return on the investment during the period of disposition.", ".04 Work in Process.

Barbara insisted on acid-etched frosted glass for the lowers and backsplash.", "“It’s easy to clean and doesn’t show fingerprints,” she explains. Extruded pulls complete the clean look.", "The couple’s devotion to the “Less is more” design philosophy had only one drawback: It created a bit of a storage problem.", "“Everywhere we could think of, we scavenged space,” Barbara says with a sly smile. Like a magician pulling a rabbit out of a hat, she opens a skinny door almost invisible to the naked eye.", "Behind the door is an exceptionally well-organized broom closet.", "Architecture: Kristine Anderson & Lars Peterssen of Peterssen/Keller Architecture"]}

Findings were analysed according to five AT outcomes (total walking for transport, within-neighbourhood walking for transport, combined walking and cycling for transport, cycling for transport, and all AT outcomes combined) and seven categories of the neighbourhood physical environment (residential density/urbanisation, walkability, street connectivity, access to/availability of services/destinations, pedestrian and cycling infrastructure, aesthetics and cleanliness/order, and safety and traffic).", "Most studies examined correlates of total walking for transport. A sufficient amount of evidence of positive associations with total walking for transport was found for residential density/urbanisation, walkability, street connectivity, overall access to destinations/services, land use mix, pedestrian-friendly features and access to several types of destinations.", "Littering/vandalism/decay was negatively related to total walking for transport. Limited evidence was available on correlates of cycling and combined walking and cycling for transport, while sufficient evidence emerged for a positive association of within-neighbourhood walking with pedestrian-friendly features and availability of benches/sitting facilities.", "Correlates of all AT combined mirrored those of walking for transport. Positive associations were also observed with food outlets, business/institutional/industrial destinations, availability of street lights, easy access to building entrance and human and motorised traffic volume.", "Several but inconsistent individual- and environmental-level moderators of associations were identified.", "Results support strong links between the neighbourhood physical environment and older adults’ AT. Future research should focus on the identification of types and mixes of destinations that support AT in older adults and how these interact with individual characteristics and other environmental factors.", "Future research should also aim to clarify dose-response relationships through multi-country investigations and data-pooling from diverse geographical regions.", "Being physically active in old age is associated with numerous positive health outcomes, such as lower incidence of cognitive impairment, depression, dementia [1], coronary heart disease, some types of cancers, diabetes, stroke and hypertension", "[2]. The risk of all-cause mortality has been shown to be reduced by walking and cycling even after adjustment for other physical activity (PA), with the greatest impact from the first 120 min and 100 min per week for walking and cycling, respectively [3].", "Active travel (AT), here defined as walking or cycling to a destination, can contribute substantiality to the accumulation of health-enhancing levels of PA in older adults.", "Older adults from Hong Kong, Chicago (USA) and Ghent (Belgium) reported AT accounted for 55% (169 min) of walking within the neighbourhood, 56% (159 min) of total walking and 42% (123 min) of total PA, respectively", "[4–6]. Changes in active commuting have been associated with corresponding changes in total PA without compensatory changes in leisure-time PA, suggesting a net benefit from engaging in AT [7, 8].", "Furthermore, older people appear to experience greater overall health benefits from transport mode shifts to AT than younger people [9].", "Benefits in addition to contributions to total PA are also incurred from AT. These include a quieter environment due to decreased motor vehicle noise as well as reductions in greenhouse gas emissions, air pollution, traffic congestion and transport costs [10].", "Modelling has shown replacement of urban trips in private motor vehicles with AT can result in important health and economic benefits and reductions in pollutants [11–13].", "Furthermore, while AT may increase exposure to air pollutants, PA benefits of AT with respect to all-cause mortality outweighed the harm caused by all but extreme levels of air pollution [14].", "As opposed to planned PA (exercise), AT is typically incidental and not specifically accrued to enhance physical fitness.", "That is, by definition the goal of AT is to reach a destination, not to accumulate PA.

Increasing density in already highly dense areas may result in a decrease in walking for transport because distances to commercial, transportation and other services become very short and/or people may opt to ‘chain’ multiple trips to a single trip.", "In this regard, a multi-country study identified thresholds of 7,500-12,000 dwellings/km2 for objectively-assessed residential density after which the odds and frequency of adults’ walking for transport plateaued or decreased [71].", "It is unknown whether these threshold values also apply to older adults. We need multi-country studies with comparable methodologies that would allow data pooling to be able to examine threshold effects and identity the optimal amount of density that supports walking and cycling for transport in older adults.", "While the availability of destinations is undoubtedly a crucial determinant of AT, it is plausible to assume that not all types of destinations are equally important to older adults [54, 57].", "Among the nine categories of destinations examined in this review, public transport stops, shops/commercial destinations and parks/open spaces/recreational facilities were the most consistent correlates of AT, with most of the evidence coming from studies examining total walking for transport.", "Some, but weaker, evidence was also found for availability of food outlets and various business/institutional/industrial destinations with respect to all AT outcomes.", "In agreement with these findings, several travel diary studies revealed that shopping (including food purchases), errands, recreational activities and social activities were the most frequently reported purposes of all-mode and/or AT trips among older adults in Australia", "[74], Hong Kong [75] and the UK [53]. Also, shops, services, food outlets, transit stops and meeting points emerged as the most frequently visited destinations by Canadian [54] and Hong Kong older adults [75].", "Good access to public transport is particularly important to older adults who do not live in destination-rich neighbourhoods", "[57] and have limited or no access to private travel options [22, 76].", "We identified several important aspects of pedestrian infrastructure and streetscape that may promote AT in older adults.", "Pedestrian-friendly features, such as the presence of well-maintained footpaths and indoor places for walking, were found to be positively related to total as well as within-neighbourhood walking.", "The same held true for availability of benches/sitting facilities and having easy access to the residential building entrance, while the presence of street lights was associated with more AT in general.", "Overall, these findings mirror those of a review of qualitative investigations [77] and a recent experimental study [78] reporting that older adults considered the presence, quality and pedestrian-friendliness of footpaths as the most important set of micro-environmental features encouraging walking.", "Older adults typically experience increasing levels of mobility limitations and fear of falling due to chronic health conditions, such as musculoskeletal diseases [79] and sensory impairments [80].", "For this reason, they are more vulnerable to physically challenging environments than younger individuals.", "Being able to easily get out of one’s home into a safe, pedestrian-friendly environment that provides opportunities for resting (benches/sitting facilities) may be decisive factors for older adults’ engaging in AT [64].", "While this review and meta-analysis support these contentions, it should be noted that, with the exception of pedestrian-friendly features, very few quantitative studies examined the effects of the above neighbourhood attributes.", "Also, findings on pedestrian-friendly features and total walking for transport were more heterogeneous than those related to walkability and its components.", "While availability of destinations is an essential determinant of AT, the importance of walking infrastructure for AT is likely to be dependent on the presence of relevant destinations and one’s functional mobility.", "The only study that examined the moderating effects of diagnosed chronic conditions affecting functional mobility on the associations of pedestrian infrastructure with walking for transport found stronger positive relationships in those with genitourinary and musculoskeletal diseases than in those without these diseases [4].", "Moreover, the presence of benches/sitting facilities was related to within-neighbourhood walking for transport only in older Hong Kong elders (aged 75+ years)", "[58]. Finally, in an experimental study on environmental features supporting AT in Belgian older adults, Van Cauwenberg and colleagues observed that the availability of benches/sitting facilities was particularly important for those with functional mobility limitations and fear of falling [78].", "Other neighbourhood built environment characteristics", "No evidence of associations with AT was found for most variables measuring neighbourhood aesthetics, cleanliness/order, traffic and crime-related safety.", "Weak evidence of a negative association was observed between the presence of litter, vandalism and decay and total walking for transport, suggesting that sometimes signs of neighbourhood disorder may discourage walking in older adults.", "Also, higher human and motorized traffic volumes tended to be positively correlated with walking for transport likely due to destination-rich, walkable areas also being heavily trafficked and visited by a large number of people.", "Some of these findings are in contrast to those reported in qualitative studies which emphasise the importance of safety [77].", "The lack of consistent quantitative evidence of an effect of aesthetics and safety on AT in older adults mirrors the findings observed in younger adults [24, 81, 82].", "There are several potential reasons responsible for these findings. It has been suggested that some individuals may engage in AT regardless of aesthetic or safety issues because they have no other option (e.g., they do not have access to public transport or own a car)", "[24, 76]. Measures of aesthetics and safety are typically generic and based on subjective evaluations that have different meaning and behavioural implications for different people", "[83, 84]. Neighbourhood aesthetics and safety may represent peripheral facilitators rather than essential determinants of AT and, for example, moderate the effects of access to destinations and services as observed in a study on Hong Kong older adults [57].", "In this regard, Alfonzo hypothesised that the need for safety and aesthetics could influence walking only if the more important need of access to services is met [73].", "Finally, most studies were conducted in high-income countries in which safety may not really be an issue, especially during the day when most of the AT is performed.", "In this respect, a multi-country study of adults including high- as well as mid-income, less safe countries (e.g., Mexico and Colombia) revealed that the positive association of safety from crime with PA was much stronger at the between-country than within-country level [85].", "Research in the area of environmental correlates of AT has been inspired by Sallis et al.’s socio-ecological model of active living [23].", "According to this model, physical environmental factors shape AT in a context-specific manner. Because walking and cycling for transport have different needs, they are likely influenced by different environmental features.", "Context specificity has also a geographical dimension according to which neighbourhood environmental attributes are hypothesised to impact on AT within and outside the neighbourhood in different ways [86, 87].", "Yet, an analysis of the current evidence reveals that most studies focused on total walking for transport, irrespective of the location where it occurred.", "Also, more studies examined cycling in combination with walking than as a distinct AT outcome. Although from a public health perspective it is undoubtedly important to identify neighbourhood characteristics that are associated with higher overall levels of activity (e.g., total walking or total AT), from a behavioural perspective it is essential to understand how these characteristics impact on specific behaviours as this knowledge can more effectively guide environmental interventions.", "Beside context specificity, another key tenet of the socio-ecological model of active living is the presence of interactions between factors shaping physical activity behaviour [23].", "The effect of an environmental characteristic on AT is hypothesised to depend on (i.e., be moderated by) individual, social and other environmental factors.", "Human behaviour is a complex phenomenon that can seldom be accurately explained by simple additive models of exposures and individual characteristics.", "Yet, this review has revealed a dearth of findings on interactions. Eight of 11 studies that examined individual-level moderators of environment-AT associations found significant interaction effects of socio-demographic, health or psychosocial factors.", "Among the seven studies that investigated environmental moderators, three observed significant effects.", "Collectively, these findings suggest that different groups of older adults are likely to require different types of environmental interventions and the effectiveness of certain environmental modifications (e.g., increased access to public transport) may depend on other environmental conditions being met (e.g., high-quality pedestrian infrastructure).", "Solid knowledge of these moderating factors is necessary to effectively target the most vulnerable population subgroups of older adults and maximise the impact of environmental interventions.", "Whenever possible, this line of research needs to undertake theory-driven rather than purely exploratory analyses, given the large number of testable interactions effects arising from studies of AT adopting an ecological approach.", "The presence of unexplored interaction effects may be one of the reasons for the heterogeneous findings observed in this review with respect to several categories of environmental factors.", "Another potential source of heterogeneity may be the different types of exposure measures. Self-report measures of land use mix and access to recreational destinations yielded stronger evidence of positive associations than did objective measures.", "The opposite was true for traffic/pedestrian safety with respect to AT, and for street connectivity with respect to walking for transport.", "Older adults who engage in AT are likely to be more aware of the availability of destinations within their neighbourhood than those who do not walk or cycle for transport.", "They are certainly more aware of the destinations that they visit (e.g., specific type of shop or food outlet).", "In contrast, objective measures of land use mix – destination diversity and destination availability may not be optimally operationalised and include a substantial number of places, services and/or land uses of little importance to older adults.", "In fact, not much is known about the optimal mix and number of destination types that might promote AT in this age group.", "Also, objective measures of destination availability are typically obtained for whole administrative areas [88–91] or home-centred buffers of various sizes [33, 92, 93], while self-report measures usually define a neighbourhood as an area within 10–20 min walk from a participant’s home", "[58, 94, 95]. Given that there is large inter-individual variability in functional mobility and walking speed among older adults [96], defining a neighbourhood using time as a parameter (as in self-report measures) may be more appropriate for this age group than defining it in terms of distance (as in objective measures of the environment).", "This could in part explain why this review found that objective distance-based measures of destination availability performed worse as correlates of AT than their self-report counterparts.", "It is interesting that, in contrast, objectively-assessed street connectivity and traffic/pedestrian safety were more consistently associated to AT outcomes than self-report measures of the same.", "It is possible that these neighbourhood attributes are more susceptible to individual response biases or more difficult to recall than destination availability due to them not being the main focus of attention during AT.", "Apart from various methodological issues (e.g., confounding, insufficient statistical power, use of measures with varying metric characteristics), some of the heterogeneity in findings observed in this review may be also the result of limited within-study and large between-study variability in exposures.", "For example, as noted earlier, there is evidence that residential density may be curvilinearly related to walking for transport in adults [24, 71].", "However, the predominately positive concave-downward relationship became apparent only after pooling data from different cities varying in residential density.", "This shape of relationship implies that data collected in low-to-mid density (e.g., <15,000 dwellings km2 [71]) areas may show a positive association between residential density and walking for transport, while studies conducted in high density areas (e.g., >15,000 [71] or >30,000 [58]) may yield nil or negative associations.", "In this review, we found this to be the case for studies based in the USA [22], Australia [97], eastern European countries [95], Belgium (low-to-medium density areas)", "[25], and Japan [35] and Hong Kong [58] (high density areas). To resolve discrepant findings potentially due to restricted variability in exposures and the presence of non-linear dose-repose relationships, pooled analyses of comparable data from geographical locations varying in exposure are necessary.", "One of the main weaknesses of the available evidence on physical environmental correlates of older adults’ AT is its cross-sectional nature.", "Cross-sectional studies cannot establish causality because they are affected by a range of threats to validity, residential self-selection being one of the most important even in good quality studies [98].", "Only four of 42 reviewed articles attempted to address self-selection by including reasons for living in a specific neighbourhood or enjoyment of an active lifestyle as covariates in regression analyses [41, 54, 60, 61].", "All four studies found evidence of positive associations between aspects of walkability and AT in older adults, indicating that the effects are unlikely to be entirely due to residential self-selection.", "Other reviews and studies that examined the potential effect of residential self-selection on PA [99] or related health outcomes", "[100] in other age groups reported similar patterns of findings and, in some instances, observed stronger associations in the expected direction after adjustment for self-selection [101].", "Apart from more good-quality cross-sectional studies, this research field would benefit from stronger causal evidence based on well-conducted prospective and quasi-experimental studies, which may be challenging as the amount and rate of environmental changes is often insufficient during the life of a typical study to significantly impact on AT [99].", "Prospective studies examining the effects of post-retirement relocation to less or more activity-friendly neighbourhoods on AT might address the likely lack of variability in environmental changes encountered in prospective studies of non-movers.", "However, studies of movers need to account for the fact that people who relocate to a new neighbourhood need a certain amount of time to become part of the community and familiarise with its physical environment.", "Also, prospective studies of movers raise selection bias concerns since movers may differ from non-movers in important ways that impact on their AT and adaptation to new environments.", "Sampling bias was identified as a significant threat to validity in over 70% of the reviewed articles, with many studies reporting very low [22, 32, 34, 50, 53, 54, 63, 65, 66] or no information on response rates [47, 48, 50–52, 55, 64, 70, 89, 93, 95, 97].", "Optimally, studies should not only report response rates but also provide an assessment of the representativeness of the sample and describe the implications of an identified or potential pattern of selection bias.", "It is particularly important to implement strategies aimed at maximising the response rate and participant retention.", "These have been extensively examined [102] and successfully employed in studies on neighbourhood correlates of AT in mid-aged adults [103].", "Mailed surveys and face-to-face interviews appear to be associated with better response rates than web-based surveys and phone interviews in older adults [104].", "Although most of the reviewed articles reported using validated measures of AT, they were all based on self-reports.", "AT is a form of incidental PA that may be more difficult to recall than leisure-time PA [86]. The use of Geographic Positioning System (GPS) devices with automated algorithms able to identify AT trips and modes (cycling versus walking) would help reduce measurement error and also clarify the extent to which neighbourhood environmental attributes impact on the geographical context of AT (e.g., walking within and outside the neighbourhood)", "The analytical approaches adopted in the reviewed articles were often acceptable. Among the unacceptable practices were: (1) the failure to account for area-level clustering invalidating the standard errors of regression coefficients and, thus, conclusions [39]; (2) the failure to report exact p-values, standard errors or 95% confidence intervals of main effects; (3) the failure to probe significant interaction effects by estimating regression coefficients and their standard errors at meaningful values of the moderator; and (4) the tendency to transform continuous outcomes and exposures into categories.", "The latter issue has been shown not only to lead to loss of statistical power but also to increase residual confounding and the likelihood of spurious associations and interaction effects [40].", "There are several strengths to this systematic review and meta-analysis. We devised a conservative meta-analytic approach that allowed a quantitative synthesis of findings that did not rely on the here-inappropriate use of precise effect sizes.", "Both published peer-reviewed scientific and grey literatures were examined to address possible article selection biases.", "When possible, findings were presented by AT mode and environmental measure type (objective and self-reported).", "Quality assessment and sample size information was incorporated in the meta-analyses and sensitivity analyses were conducted to examine the effects of this information on the conclusions.", "Limitations include the inability to more accurately quantify associations due to large variability in exposures and outcomes; in some instances, not accounting for correlated findings extracted from the same study (e.g., multiple outcomes falling into the same AT category); the inability to examine the moderating effects of neighbourhood size on the strength of environment – AT associations due to studies not examining this issue (except for Etman et al.’s study, with no clear emerging patterns of associations [33]); and the exclusive focus on work published in English which possibly led to an over-representation of studies from developed countries.", "Many substantive questions on the topic of this review remain unanswered. To guide future research, Fig.", "2 depicts a proposed conceptual model that focuses on the most important neighbourhood feature for AT: destinations.", "Individuals are more likely to walk or cycle to/from places if they are within affordable distance from home.", "Yet, this review suggests that not all destinations are relevant to older adults. Shops, food outlets, commercial and government services, public transport stops and recreational facilities appear to be particularly important.", "However, little is known about the mix and density of types of shops, services and facilities that are necessary to optimally promote AT among older adults.", "An optimal mix and density of destinations and services catering for older adults’ daily needs may be available in the community.", "However, whether older residents will wish to visit them depends on their appeal. Further, residents will walk or cycle to ‘appealing’ destinations and services only if they are sufficiently accessible by AT, and AT is a more appealing option than motorised transport.", "Figure 2 lists potential individual and environmental factors influencing access to destinations and the appeal of destinations and AT.", "These ‘accessibility’ and ‘appeal’ factors are hypothesised to moderate the associations of destination types and mixes with AT by determining one’s capacity to reach a destination by AT (‘accessibility’), one’s desire or need to visit a destination (destination ‘appeal’), and one’s preference to use AT (AT ‘appeal’).", "These factors are also postulated to independently influence AT, but only when destinations are available [73].", "These propositions are in line with the moderating effects of sex [25, 35], age [25, 58, 63], health status [4, 34], pedestrian infrastructure and pedestrian/crime safety [57] found in a few studies included in this review, and are based on concepts from the socio-ecological models of active living [23], Webber et al.’s model of mobility in older adults [107], the transportation and planning literature [108] and time geography [108, 109].", "Overall, the effects of potential moderators shown in Fig. 2 are largely unexplored and constitute an important component of the research agenda for future studies.", "The mediating role of perceptions of the neighbourhood environment in explaining the effects of the objective environment on AT is another critical issue (not depicted in Fig.", "2) that needs to be tackled in future studies. Only one of the 42 reviewed studies investigated this matter [51].", "If, as suggested by this synthesis of evidence, perceptions of destinations are more powerful predictors of AT than objective measures, it is important to understand the extent to which and under what circumstances perceptions may be manipulated through environmental changes.", "Another contested issue regards the definition of neighbourhood or size of the area that influences older adults’ AT behaviour.", "While self-report measures typically define a neighbourhood using a time metric (e.g., 15–20 min walk from home [110]), objective measures use distance (e.g., 400 m street-network buffer around the home).", "As the transportation literature suggests that most individuals are prepared to travel up to 20 min to discretionary destinations [69], it makes sense to define buffers around the home in terms of time.", "This is because the distance walked or cycled in a specific amount of time depends on one’s physical capacity and the environmental characteristics of the street network.", "In general, the majority of studies on environmental correlates of older adults’ AT have been conducted in North America.", "There is a paucity of findings from other geographical regions. The same applies to cycling as a mode of transport, including the use of electric bicycles as a viable option for older adults with lower functional capacity [111].", "Future studies need to address these knowledge gaps.", "Conclusions and implications for policy and practice", "Although research on the neighbourhood physical environmental correlates of older adults’ AT has flourished in the last 5 years, more well-conducted studies across the globe are needed to establish the optimal profiles and thresholds of neighbourhood environmental attributes that support walking and cycling for transport in different groups of older adults.", "Acknowledging the limitations of the available evidence, this review suggests that in order to promote and support older adults’ AT, especially walking for transport, it is important that neighbourhoods be walkable.", "Specifically, older residents should be provided easy, within-walking-distance access to shops, public transport, recreational facilities and various commercial and institutional services through a network of well-maintained and safe footpaths with sufficient places to rest (i.e., benches).", "It is important that environmental enhancements be developed and implemented so that they are optimally matched to the context-specific needs (e.g., extant levels of density) and demographics (e.g., sex and age composition) of the community.", "Also, objective enhancements to the neighbourhood environment may need to be accompanied by efforts to raise awareness of these enhancements.", "Jackson PA, Pialoux V, Corbett D, Drogos L, Erickson KI, Eskes GA, et al.

One was that voclosporin was not more tolerable than Allergan's top-selling eyedrop Restasis, meaning that the trial missed its primary endpoint.", "Secondly, Aurinia's candidate showed signs of superior efficacy to Restasis. Allergan’s loss of market exclusivity means that the dry eye market will be tough to break into, and the mark to beat might not be set by Restasis, but rather by Shire’s Xiidra.", "Investors appeared to be confused about the meaning of the data, with a sell-off and recovery pre-market, only to sell again once the markets opened.", "Voclosporin already had mixed results in that setting; the earlier Aura-LV trial in lupus was troubled by an inconsistent dose response and an imbalance in deaths (Aurinia suffers a headache with Aura, August 15, 2016).", "In spite of that setback, the sell-side expects voclosporin sales of $649 million in 2024, according to EvaluatePharma’s consensus.", "Lupus has been a problematic disorder for drug developers. GlaxoSmithKline’s Benlysta was the first agent in 50 years to achieve approval in 2011, and nothing has emerged since.", "It might be just as well that Aurinia has the dry eye indication as a second shot on goal, even if investors are cool to it.", "Adding his voice, Terry Chrisomalis on Seeking Alpha says that Aurinia Pharmaceuticals didn't achieve what it wanted in terms of beating out Restasis as being more tolerable, but it more than made up for it in terms of efficacy.", "It obtained an edge in efficacy using voclosporin on two endpoints known as STT and FCS.", "The fact that voclosporin obtained both efficacy endpoint measures with a rapid onset of action over Restasis should be enough to prove that Aurinia has a good shot at obtaining market share in the dry eye disease space.", "The biggest risk is that a large Phase III study will still be needed in order to gain FDA approval. There is no guarantee that the Phase III study will meet on its primary endpoint with a larger patient population.", "In addition, there is no guarantee that Aurinia will be able to find a partner before it has to raise cash again.", "Other than these risks, Mr Chrisomalis believes that Aurinia is in great shape.", "UK’s foray into value-based pricing antibiotics could stimulate R&R and aid stewardship", "Following the UK government’s announcement (January 24) that the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) and NHS England will trial a value-based pricing model for antibiotics to help stimulate R&D and address growing antimicrobial resistance (AMR) concerns,", "Christopher Pace, director or infectious disease at data and analytics form GlobalData, offers his view on this procurement model:", "‘‘The UK government’s decision to explore value-based pricing for antibiotics represents an important step away from the traditional approach of directly linking payments to sales volume - a pricing strategy that does not work well for antibiotics as it conflicts with stewardship efforts and ultimately discourages the proper use of both new and well-established antibiotics.", "“From the commercial standpoint, a value-based pricing scheme could also help to stimulate antibiotic R&D as companies will be incentivized to position products for smaller groups of patients where high unmet medical need exists, without worrying about stymieing return on investment (ROI).", "“The rising prevalence of AMR represents a global public health crisis of monumental proportions. Governments and other public health stakeholders must acknowledge that in order to successfully combat AMR, stewardship efforts must be paired with a renewed push to discover and develop new antibiotics.", "Procurement models that move away from volume-based payment is an approach worth exploring, because unlike many other drugs, antibiotics arguably lose value the more they are used, pitting drug developers and public stakeholders against one another.", "“Alternative approaches to antibiotic procurement have received increasing attention over the past year, with the US FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb proposing a licensing-based reimbursement model for novel antibiotics.", "Under this proposal, institutions would purchase a license to have access to a predetermined number of doses of a novel antibiotic, rather than paying each time it is used.", "“While slightly different from the UK government’s value-based proposal, both of these ideas illustrate the growing sentiment that changes must be made to current procurement strategies in order to better align them with AMR concerns, while also helping to address R&D hurdles.", "The UK government’s proposal is a bold step in the right direction and merits close attention as it’s implemented in the coming year.”", "Along with presenting 2018 financial results on Friday, AbbVie's chief executive, Richard Gonzalez, has admitted that 2019 will be a “real test” of the group’s strategy to counter Humira sales erosion with new growth products, and the numbers quietly revealed today during the company’s fourth-quarter earnings call show why, observes Jonathan Gardner on Vantage.", "Mr Gonzalez estimated that in 2019 ex-US sales will fall $2 billion thanks to biosimilar entry in Europe and elsewhere, and the company’s guidance is for a 7% increase in US sales – roughly $1 billion.", "This $1 billion decline, on aggregate, comes to more than double the $389 million decrease foreseen by the EvaluatePharma consensus of sell-side forecasts – forecasts which will likely now be revised downwards.", "AbbVie shares tumbled 7% Friday morning. Adding to investor disappointment was Mr Gonzalez’s dismissal of any major M&A action, friendly or hostile; he hinted that the benchmark set by the $20.8 billion Pharmacyclics acquisition might be the upper limit of what AbbVie would consider.", "US Humira sales are expected to grow only $1 billion in 2019, below consensus expectations of +$1.4 billion, noted Leerink Research analyst Geoffrey Porges.", "This guidance contemplates growth of 7%, down from 10% achieved in 2018. Management stated that this is not due to a change in volume trends, but is due to a lighter price contribution for the year.", "AbbVie executed one-time 6.2% price increases for some of its portfolio products in January 2019, which is less than the 9.7% increase taken in January 2018 for Humira.", "Exacerbating the decline of Humira sales, AbbVie also expect $400mm headwind for AndroGel in 2019 due to generic competition which started in the fourth quarter.", "This generic launch has already reduced sequential sales for the product by 44% in fourth-quarter 2018.", "Based on the trends AbbVie expects in 2019, it appears unlikely that the company will meet its previously announced 2020 targets of Humira sales of $21 billion and an operating margin of >50%.", "Other prior guidance items that are questionable include Duodopa and Imbruvica.", "Commented on financials from the US healthcare giant, Blogger ‘The Value Investor’ on Seeking Alpha pointed out that Johnson & Johnson has seen some growth deceleration towards the end of 2018, a trend which the company expects to last into 2019, which should be concerning to investors.", "In the time frame of just a few months, J&J has gone from a strong solid organic growth play to a diversified operation showing less growth and having to deal with asbestos risks as well, as reports scared the financial community back In December.", "While the 3.3% operational growth number reported for the final quarter of 2018 marked a slowdown, investors should not see this as an isolated event.", "For 2019, J&J sees operational growth at 2%-3%, which, combined with two percent currency headwinds, results in flat to 1% reported sales growth in US dollar terms.", "Despite this slower pace of growth, J&J sees adjusted earnings increase from $8.18 per share in 2018 to $8.50-8.65 per share this year.", "The outlook is discomforting as J&J has long been a player with great diversification and international strength, almost guaranteeing growth.", "While consumer sales and medical devices have been growing at a slower pace for a while, the surprise is the slowdown in the core pharmaceutical segment."]}

In the 1990 paper, in which Dr. Kohn applied the teachings of his 1987 paper, Dr. Kohn kept \"R1 constant and R constant\" as methyl and benzyl, respectively.", "(See Kohn Tr. at 485-86; JTX-11 at 919 Tbl.1) He reported that the most potent compound was 2g, which had 2-furanyl at R3, benzyl at R, and methyl at R1.", "(Kohn Tr. at 486; DDX-726) Compound 2g \"was found to be significantly more potent than APB, and at the time in 1990 when this paper was published this was the most potent compound in the FAA family.\"", "93. Dr. Kohn's 1990 paper also considered the effect of replacing an unsubstituted benzyl at R with a fluoro-substituted benzyl.", "(JTX-11 at DEF_272) The 1990 paper found that such a substitution yields a \"far superior\" protective index and a comparable anti-convulsant effect.", "(See id.; Kohn Tr. at 489) The substitution was made in an FAA with an unsubstituted methyl at R1 and an aromatic 2-furanyl structure at R3.", "94. Kohn 1991 summarizes the previous work with FAAs, explaining that that \"you get potent protection if you have a benzyl on one end and a methyl on the other.\"", "(Kohn Tr. at 493) All 26 compounds reported in Kohn 1991 had unsubstituted benzyl at R and unsubstituted methyl at R1, with different compounds at the R3 group attached to the α-carbon.", "Kohn 1991 uses a different depiction of the FAA structure where R3 is labeled X or R2.

Compound 31 contains a nonaromatic methoxyamino group at R3.

(Kohn Tr. at 435) Lilly instead focused all of its development efforts on a structurally different FAA compound with a heteroaromatic furan group at R3.", "97. Moreover, the ED50 data for compound 31 was published in 1991, five years before the priority date of the '551 patent.", "(Heathcock Tr. at 126-27; Kohn Tr. at 434-35; JTX-80) Yet compound 31 was never pursued nor even suggested as a lead compound by anyone (until this litigation).", "98.

(See id.; Heathcock Tr. at 137-38; JTX-80) Medicinal chemists try to avoid developing compounds containing this bond because it is not sufficiently stable for use in drugs.", "99. Dr. Kohn continued to explore heteroaromatic groups, publishing data for many other compounds with heteroaromatic groups at R3 and demonstrating excellent anticonvulsant activity.", "He reported nine FAAs with heteroaromatic groups with ED50s below 20 mg/kg:", "100. All of the prior art compounds with nonaromatic, carbon-based groups at R3 had significantly lower anticonvulsant activity and would not have been of any interest.", "101. In 1993, Dr. Kohn published the results of an experiment that reinforced the importance of an aromatic group at R3.", "(JTX-56; Roush Tr. at 591-92) He showed that when the heteroaromatic furan ring was chemically converted into the nonaromatic tetrahydrofuran (\"THF\") ring, two THF isomers were produced, which were five and nine times less active than the compound with a furan ring at R3.", "(JTX-56 at DEF_279, Tbl.2) A POSA would take away from these data that an aromatic group is the key for good anticonvulsant activity.", "102. In Kohn 1993, the \"starting point\" again was benzyl at R and methyl at R1.

The LeGall Thesis disclosed 15 new FAA compounds and provided anticonvulsant data for all but one of those compounds.", "106.

LeGall recognized that heteroaromatic compounds showed the most promise.

After the '551 patent issued, RCT told the PTO that the '301 patent covered lacosamide. In an application to extend the term of the '301 patent, RCT represented that \"claims 39-45\" of the patent \"claim the active ingredient ... lacosamide.\"", "(DTX-2095 at DEF_4996) That document also represented that claim 46 of the '301 patent \"cover[s] a therapeutic composition\" of lacosamide and that \"[c]laim 47[] cover[s] a method of treating central nervous system disorders\" with lacosamide.", "162.

The differences between claims 44 and 45 of the '301 patent, on the one hand, and claim 9 of the '551 patent, on the other, are that claim 9 fills in the variables of the claim 44/45 equation, so as to narrow the genus of claims 44 and 45 to the species of a single compound, lacosamide.", "These differences are depicted below and can understood in three parts.", "164.

Many of these companies were skeptical that FAAs would meet the demand that existed for new AEDs.", "(See Vellturo Tr. at 923) For example, Boehringer Ingelheim declined a license offer because \"[b]ased on the present profile of the agents, we feel they would not offer a significant market advantage over current treatments.\"", "169. In 1986, Eli Lilly took a license to explore Dr. Kohn's FAAs.

Eventually, in the mid-1990s, Harris FRC took a license to the FAA compounds.

Even UCB, which eventually acquired Schwarz Pharma (the company that took a license to lacosamide from Harris), was initially skeptical that lacosamide would be a successful AED.", "(Klitgaard Tr. at 879-85; JTX-32; JTX-33) UCB was skeptical because it thought lacosamide would be a \"me too\" drug that offered no patient benefits, and because the available data suggested that lacosamide was an NMDA receptor (i.e., sodium receptor) antagonist which may produce unacceptable psychiatric effects.", "179.

Bd. of Regents of Univ. of Wash., 334 F.3d 1264, 1270 (Fed.", "Cir. 2003) (\"Eli Lilly II\"); see also Brigham & Women's Hosp. Inc. v. Teva Pharm. USA. Inc., 761 F. Supp.", "2d. 210, 224 (D.

Dr. Kohn reported that the R enantiomers of these compounds were ten times more potent than the S enantiomers.", "(See id.) Consistent with these observations. Dr. Kohn testified that he \"never published any results before 1996 showing that . . .", "the S or L enantiomer was more active than the D or R.\" (Kohn Tr. at 509) Dr. Kohn's statements are supported and confirmed by the preferences articulated in the '729 patent, which indicate that the R enantiomer is preferred.", "(See '729 patent at 10:27-28; Roush Tr. at 694-95) These facts are sufficient to show that a POSA would have found it obvious to isolate the R-enantiomer of any FAA that was selected for further development.", "Plaintiffs did not offer any evidence or data that would support a contrary conclusion.", "Crucially, however, other differences between the claims would not have been obvious. First, to a POSA beginning with claim 45 of the '301 patent, it would not have been obvious to place an unsubstituted benzyl at R. Most of the pre-1996 experimentation relating to FAAs was performed at the R3 position.", "(See FF 73-74) As a result, at the critical date, March 1996, there was relatively little data on which a POSA could draw to form reasonable expectations about the impact of placing an unsubstituted benzyl at R.", "The Federal Circuit has emphasized that \"predictability is a vital consideration in the obviousness analysis,\" including obviousness-type double patenting.", "Otsuka, 678 F.3d at 1298 (citing KSR, 550 U.S. at 421). In the context of drug development, data is a necessary prerequisite to predicting the impact of modifying a chemical compound.", "(See FF 66) This is especially so because of the unpredictability of drug development. (See FF 66-67)", "Therefore, the absence of data is a strong indication of the non-obviousness of the claimed invention.", "Although there were many tests conducted on FAAs with benzyl at R and methyl at R1 (see Heathcock Tr. at 113 (explaining that 75% of Dr. Kohn's compounds contained benzyl at R and methyl at R1, and most of these were unsubstituted)), these tests, and the resulting data, do not provide much insight into the effectiveness of benzyl and methyl relative to other structures that could be placed at R and R1.", "Most of these tests kept the structures at R and R1 constant in order to assess changes made at the R3 position.", "(See Kohn Tr. at 410, 508-09) Consequently, any changes (whether increases or decreases) observed in anticonvulsant behavior and/or neurotoxicity would be attributed to the structure at R3 rather than to the benzyl at R or the methyl at R1.", "(See Roush Tr. at 681-82) As Dr. Roush explained, \"[y]ou can't . . . say he [i.e., Dr. Kohn] used only benzyl at R and used only methyl at R1 and, therefore, say that he's selected them and that they're the best.", "There is no data to say whether benzyl is best or something else would be the best.\" (Id.) In fact, according to the data that was available at the critical date, the FAAs containing an unsubstituted benzyl demonstrate a range of effectiveness.", "Again, given how unpredictable drug development is (see FF 66), and the high likelihood that any formulation will prove unsuccessful (see FF 197), the lack of data strongly contributes to the Court's finding that the placement of an unsubstituted benzyl at R and of an unsubstituted methyl at R1 render the asserted claims patentably distinct.", "It is only with improper use of hindsight that one could conclude that it would have been obvious to a POSA to use those structures to fill in the variables.", "While the Court's conclusion is motivated largely by the lack of data, it is also the case that the limited data that did exist at the time would not have led a POSA to place an unsubstituted benzyl at R. In 1987, Dr. Kohn published a paper demonstrating that a compound with a fluoro-substituted benzyl at R had similar anticonvulsant activity to an analogous compound with an unsubstituted benzyl, but with a substantial improvement in neurotoxicity levels.", "(See Roush Tr. at 616; JTX-7 at DEF_566 Tbl.6) These results were confirmed in Kohn's 1990 paper, which showed that in certain FAAs, structures with various fluoro-substituted benzyls yielded a \"far superior\" protective index while maintaining a comparable anticonvulsant effect (relative to the same compound with an unsubstituted benzyl).", "(See Kohn Tr. at 396, 489 (explaining that replacing unsubstituted benzyl with fluoro-substituted benzyl yielded \"an improvement in the overall protective index resulting from a decrease in neurotoxicity of the compound\"); JTX-11 at Tbl.2, DEF_272)", "The data from some of these experiments were also included in the '729 patent. (See '729 patent at Tbl.1 (rows 9, 18, and 43); see also JTX-11 at Tbl.2; Roush Tr. at 616-17)", "Given the data (and lack of data), a POSA starting with claim 45 of the '301 patent would have had no reasonable expectation of achieving a successful AED FAA by placing an unsubstituted benzyl at R.", "Further supporting the Court's conclusion is the fact that other scientists who were studying FAAs at approximately the same time as the priority date of the '551 patent did not select an unsubstituted benzyl at R. Drs.", "Paruszewski and Hinko experimented with each variable in Dr. Kohn's FAA structure, and they did not constantly or even often use an unsubstituted benzyl at R. Dr. Hinko focused extensively on modifications to the R position, such that only two of his 21 compounds contained an unsubstituted benzyl.", "The work of Drs. Paruszewski and Hinko does not qualify as prior art. Nevertheless, their exploration is relevant because it shows what a POSA would have thought at around the priority date.", "Specifically, it is probative of the fact that the benefits of lacosamide (including the placement of a benzyl at R and a methyl at R1) were not apparent until well after the priority date of the '551 patent.", "In sum, the placement of unsubstituted benzyl at the R position in claim 9 of the '551 patent is patentably distinct from the millions of possible groups that could be placed at the R position in claim 45 of the '301 patent.", "Likewise, it would also not have been obvious for a POSA starting with claim 45 of the '301 patent to place an unsubstituted methyl at R1.", "As with the situation that confronted a POSA considering what to place at R, and as noted above, a POSA deciding what to place at R1 had little data upon which to draw as to the impact of placing an unsubstituted methyl at R1.", "(See Roush Tr. at 646) Hence, again, the unpredictability of drug development means that the lack of data concerning R1 is a strong reason why the selection of an unsubstituted methyl would not have been obvious to a POSA in March 1996.", "The Court's conclusion with respect to R1 is also supported by research conducted by others working on FAAs at the same time as Dr. Kohn.", "Dr. Hinko modified the FAA structure to change the way the structure at R1 connected with the rest of the molecule.", "(See Roush Tr. at 614; JTX-87 at Tbl.1) Dr. Paruszewski explored a similar change by removing the carbonyl group (C==O) to which the R1 group is attached.", "The Court accords less weight to the evidence of what Drs. Hinko and Paruszewski did at R1 than it does with respect to what these same scientists did at R, due to the Court's assumption that for double patenting a POSA would effectively \"lock in\" all that is common between claim 45 of the '301 patent and claim 9 of the '551 patent.", "From this assumption it would seem to follow that, for purposes of the double patenting analysis, the general structure of the FAA of claim 45 of the '301 patent would be preserved, meaning that the Court should not consider the alterations made by Drs.", "Hinko and Paruszewski. When this assumption is removed - because it is an incorrect assumption for double patenting, and/or at the general obviousness analysis - the weight given to this evidence increases substantially.", "Defendants contend that scientists were deterred from using an unsubstituted benzyl at R and an unsubstituted methyl at R1 due to Plaintiffs' \"blocking patent\" rights.", "Viewed in light of all of the evidence, this argument is not persuasive. The record lacks clear and convincing evidence that the patents were the reason Drs.", "Hinko and Paruszewski did not fill in R and R1 with the structures required to arrive at lacosamide. Instead, given the evidence before the Court, it appears that these other scientists did not do so because it was not obvious to do so.", "Furthermore, the Court is not persuaded that Plaintiffs' patents were \"blocking patents,\" as explained in connection with commercial success below (see infra).", "Defendants point out that Dr. Kohn's limited experimentation with the R1 position was substantially less promising than his experimentation with the R position, meaning - in Defendants' view - that a POSA would have been less motivated to alter the unsubstituted methyl Dr. Kohn often used at R1.", "At the R position, there were many structures that performed comparably to - and, in some ways, better than - unsubstituted benzyl.", "(FF 89, 93) In contrast, Dr. Kohn found that none of the modifications he made at the R1 position showed as good activity as the unsubstituted methyl.", "(See Kohn Tr. at 468-69) While this fact arguably means that a POSA would have been more likely to have placed an unsubstituted methyl at R1 than to have placed an unsubstituted benzyl at R, the lack of data, in tandem with the fact that other scientists responded to Dr. Kohn's work by modifying the FAA structure in different ways, supports the Court's conclusions that it would not have been obvious to place an unsubstituted methyl at R1.", "In sum, the placement of an unsubstituted methyl at the R1 position in claim 9 of the '551 patent is patentably distinct from the large number of structures that could be placed at the R1 position in claim 45 of the '301 patent.", "The Court has considered all of Defendants' arguments for a contrary conclusion and finds them unavailing.", "Defendants emphasize that the '729 patent disclosed that benzyl is \"especially preferred\" for placement at the R position.", "(See FF 118-119; D.I. 263 at 8) Similarly, the '729 patent expresses a preference for unsubstituted methyl at R1.", "(FF 119) While Defendants are correct, the double patenting analysis requires a POSA to start with the '301 patent's claim 45, not with the '729 patent.", "Moreover, in light of the totality of evidence in the record - which includes the lack of data showing the effect of placing an unsubstituted benzyl at R, the lack of data showing the effect of placing an unsubstituted methyl at R1, and the data showing positive results from placing something other than an unsubstituted benzyl at R- it is only with impermissible hindsight that a POSA would have focused on the \"especially preferred\" language of the '729 patent's disclosure.", "Defendants further argue that Plaintiffs knew about lacosamide when they added genus claims 39-47 to the '301 patent.", "While this appears to be correct (compare FF 79-80 (showing that Dr. Kohn had synthesized and tested lacosamide by late 1994) with DTX-2016 (showing that genus claims of '301 patent were added in October 1995)), it does not impact the Court's analysis, which must focus on the hypothetical inquiry of what the POSA would have done - not what the real inventor actually did do.", "\"The inventor's own path itself never leads to a conclusion of obviousness; that is hindsight.

As Plaintiffs observe, \"[r]ather than using the patents to block development efforts, RCT and Harris, on behalf of Dr. Kohn, offered licenses to them.\"", "(SRB at 4) In 1991, Lilly terminated its license to the entire class of FAA compounds. (FF 170) After the termination, RCT offered to license the FAA compounds to other companies.", "(See FF 171; SRB at 4; Vellturo Tr. at 920) The availability of a license meant that companies had the opportunity to pursue FAAs.", "At most, the disincentives that other potential developers would have encountered prior to 1996 reduces the weight the Court should give to the strong evidence of Vimpat®'s commercial success.", "Still, the record as a whole supports a finding of commercial success.", "Defendants further argue that the success of Vimpat® is attributable not to the merits of lacosamide but instead to the marketing efforts made on its behalf.", "(RB at 13-14) The record belies this contention. Vimpat®'s sales have continued to grow despite a sharp reduction in marketing expenditures; the marketing-sales ratio has decreased substantially since the drug launched.", "(See JTX-75; Vellturo Tr. at 955) Further, the total amount of money spent to market Vimpat® has been small relative to what has been expended on other branded AEDs.", "Accordingly, the Court concludes that evidence of commercial success supports a finding of nonobviousness.", "Plaintiffs contend that the fact that Defendants want to copy Vimpat® is additional evidence that Vimpat® was nonobvious.", "(See OB at 31-32) In Bayer Healthcare Pharms., Inc. v. Watson Pharms., Inc., 713 F.3d 1369, 1377 (Fed.", "Cir. 2013), the Federal Circuit stated that \"evidence of copying in the [generic drug] context is not probative of non-obviousness.\"", "Plaintiffs make no attempt to distinguish Bayer. Accordingly, the Court concludes that the undisputed evidence of copying is not probative of nonobviousness.", "Having concluded that the asserted claims of the '551 patent are not invalid due to obviousness-type double patenting, the Court now turns to Defendants' contention that these claims are invalid due to statutory obviousness.", "Specifically, Defendants contend that claim 9 is invalid for obviousness \"based on LeGall's synthesis of compound 107e as a racemic mixture that contains lacosamide - with or without other prior art.\"", "(OB at 20) \"Examples of prior art references that would render claim 9 obvious include the LeGall thesis alone, the LeGall thesis and the '729 patent; and the LeGall thesis, the '729 patent, and Kohn 1991.\"", "(OB at 23) As explained below, the Court disagrees with Defendants.", "Defendants acknowledge that the conclusion with respect to the obviousness of claims 10 and 13 should be the same as the conclusion with respect to claim 9.", "(See OB at 23) The Court focuses its analysis on claim 9.", "Essentially all of the discussion above in the context of double patenting applies equally with respect to obviousness.", "The Court focuses here on the differences in the analyses. They are principally that: (i) while the Court assumed, arguendo, that for double patenting a POSA would retain all of the features that are common to the reference patent claims and the challenged asserted claims, with obviousness even Defendants do not argue for such a restriction, so the Court must consider whether a POSA would have modified any of the common features between the prior art and the asserted claims; and (ii) while for double patenting the Court's analysis must begin with the compound of the reference patent's claim, for obviousness the Court must apply a lead compound analysis.", "Both of these distinctions favor Plaintiffs. That is, both of these distinctions - because they require Defendants to prove more things - make it more difficult for Defendants to prove the claims of the patent-in-suit are invalid for obviousness.", "It follows, and the Court here expressly concludes, that for the same reasons that Defendants have failed to prove, by clear and convincing evidence, that any of the asserted claims of the '551 patent are invalid due to obviousness-type double patenting, so, too, have Defendants failed to prove, by clear and convincing evidence, that any of the asserted claims of the '551 patent are invalid due to obviousness.", "The Court's discussion of obviousness, below, therefore, is fairly truncated.", "As explained above as \"Further Evidence Against a Finding of Double Patenting Invalidity,\" a POSA on March 15, 1996, in possession of all of the prior art relied on by Defendants, would not have been motivated to use methoxymethyl at the R3 position of an FAA being developed as an AED.", "Instead, such a POSA would have been motivated to use a heteroaromatic structure at R3. Methoxymethyl is nonaromatic, not heteroaromatic.", "Relatedly, a POSA would have had no reasonable expectation of success in developing an effective AED from an FAA by using methoxymethyl at R3.", "Therefore, in addition to the deficiencies with Defendants' showing with respect to an unsubstituted benzyl at R and an unsubstituted methyl at R1, Defendants' failure of proof with respect to the use of methoxymethyl at R3 means that Defendants have failed to prove that claim 9 is invalid due to obviousness.", "ii. Defendants Have Failed to Satisfy the Lead Compound Analysis", "The Court agrees with Plaintiffs that, as concerns obviousness, the Court must apply a \"lead compound analysis.\"", "This is because the claims at issue disclose a chemical compound. (See AB at 6-7) Defendants counter that a lead compound analysis is inappropriate because the claimed compound, lacosamide, can be derived from a racemic mixture.", "(See AB at 20-21) Defendants cite no binding nor persuasive authority for their contention. Thus, the Court will undertake a lead compound analysis to determine whether the claimed chemical compound would have been obvious in light of a previous chemical compound.", "Defendants point to Aventis Pharma Deutschland GmbH v. Lupin, Ltd., 499 F.3d 1293, 1301 (Fed. Cir. 2007), in which the Federal Circuit held:", "[I]f it is known that some desirable property of a mixture derives in whole or in part from a particular one of its components, or if the prior art would provide a person of ordinary skill in the art with reason to believe that this is so, the purified compound is prima facie obvious over the mixture even without an explicit teaching that the ingredient should be concentrated or purified.", "In doing so, the Court must first consider whether a POSA \"would have selected the asserted prior art compound as a lead compound, or starting point, for further development.\"", "Pfizer Inc. v. Teva Pharm. USA, Inc., 555 F. App'x 961, 969 (Fed. Cir. 2014); see also Takeda Chem. Indus., Ltd. v. Alphapharm Pty., Ltd., 492 F.3d 1350, 1357 (Fed.", "Cir. 2007). If so, the Court must next consider whether it would have been obvious to move from the prior art compound to the patented compound.", "Defendants contend that a lead compound analysis (if required) would begin with a POSA's selection of compound 107e from the LeGall Thesis, as supported by the teachings of the '729 patent.", "First, the record demonstrates that in March 1996, a POSA would not have selected any FAA as a lead compound.", "As of 1996, a POSA seeking to develop an AED would have started by looking at FDA-approved drugs or at compounds with demonstrated clinical efficacy.", "(FF 64) This approach would have yielded hundreds of potential starting points, none of which would have been FAAs.", "(Id.) As of March 1996, no FAA had been approved by the FDA as an AED and no FAA had been identified as a well-advanced preclinical candidate.", "(FF 65) In fact, the literature at the time relating to AED development does not even acknowledge FAAs.", "For example, in 1994, Epilepsy Research published a paper entitled \"Strategies in Antiepileptic Drug Development: Is Rational Drug Design Superior to Random Screening and Structural Variation?\" (JTX-91; FF 64)", "The paper contained a broad survey of AEDs and AED development, but did not reference or discuss FAAs.", "(See generally JTX-91) Similarly, a paper entitled \"Antiepileptic Drugs: Pharmacological Mechanisms and Clinical Efficacy with Consideration of Promising Developmental Stage Compounds\" described different types of AEDs, but did not discuss FAAs.", "If, despite the record, a POSA were to have selected an FAA as a starting point, there is no basis to find that such a person would have selected compound 107e from the LeGall Thesis as the lead FAA compound.", "The LeGall Thesis contains no data pertaining to compound 107e. To the contrary, the overall thrust of the LeGall Thesis made compound 107e substantially less promising than aromatic alternatives; and the appeal of compound 107e is based on its similarity to another compound (86b), which itself was not particularly promising.", "The fact that the LeGall Thesis speculated that compound 107e \"may have good anticonvulsant activity\" does not nearly amount to making 107e something a POSA would likely select as a starting point in developing an AED.", "Defendants argue that if a POSA did not select 107e as a lead compound, then the POSA would have instead selected compound 31, from Kohn 1991, as its lead compound.", "Again the Court disagrees. By 1996, nonaromatic compounds (like 31) were generally disfavored, as the bulk of the literature on FAAs showed that aromatic FAAs demonstrated better anticonvulsant activity.", "Defendants make this argument in one sentence of one footnote. Arguments that are presented in limited form in footnotes are entitled to little weight.", "See infra at note 36 (explaining that arguments made in footnotes are disfavored and entitled to little weight).", "As presented, the argument does not persuade the Court that a POSA would have chosen compound 31 as a lead compound.", "Nevertheless, out of an abundance of caution, the Court will address the argument in full.", "Even if, contrary to the evidence, a POSA would have selected a nonaromatic FAA as a lead compound, such a person would not have selected compound 31.", "Compound 31 is a nonaromatic FAA containing NH(OCH3) at the R3 position. (JTX-80 at DEF_710) Compound 31 also contains an N-O bond, which is unstable and can easily be altered at physiological pH. (See FF 98)", "Because of this instability, medicinal chemists at the time avoided working with compounds that had an N-O bond.", "The Court's conclusion that a POSA would not have been motivated to select compound 31 as a lead compound is corroborated by the fact that compound 31 was not seriously explored or pursued by anyone (including Dr. Kohn), despite the fact that data relating to the compound was published in 1991 and available to researchers.", "(See Heathcock Tr. at 187 (explaining that he did not know of any researchers who identified 31 as having structural promise))", "Notably, Eli Lilly, which was working with Dr. Kohn and which had tested compound 31, decided to focus its FAA development efforts on compounds with an aromatic group at R3.", "Hence, Defendants' obviousness position fails at the first step of the lead compound analysis. Nonetheless, if a POSA were to have selected a nonaromatic FAA as a lead compound, and if a POSA were to have specifically selected compound 31 as her FAA of choice, Defendants have failed to prove that such a person would have been motivated to change the NHOC3 of compound 31 to the CH2OCH3 of lacosamide.", "The record does not establish that a POSA contemplating such a change would have had a reasonable expectation that such a substitution would yield a promising result.", "In arguing to the contrary, Defendants rely on the concept of \"bioisoterism\" (see Heathcock Tr. at 131-32), which teaches that some structures - in this case amine (-NH-) and methylene (-CH2-) - \"impart similar physical or chemical properties to a molecule\" and are \"frequently interchangeable in drugs.\"", "(See JTX-68 at DEF_780) Defendants argue that a POSA would have been motivated to replace the NH structure in compound 31 with a CH2 structure.", "This argument is based on the fact that the structures are bioisoteric, and that comparable activity was observed when the same substitution was used to change compound 3a to compound 2a.", "The Court is not persuaded. A POSA could have made any of a variety of structural changes to compound 31 to affect its potency - including homologation, chain branching, and ring-chain transformations (see JTX-69 at DEF_807-15) - and Defendants do not explain why a POSA would have chosen bioisoterism instead of these other methods.", "Defendants have also not shown that a POSA would have had a reasonable expectation of success with a bioisoterism approach.", "Bioisoteric substitutions can change the way a molecule interacts with biological receptors. (See Roush Tr. at 607-12) Because these changes are unique to each molecule and could drastically impact drug performance, a POSA would not have been able to predict the effect of a bioisoteric substitution.", "(See id. at 611-12 (explaining that bioisoteric substitutions are \"really not predictable\" and that any predictions about how substitution would impact drug efficacy would be \"very, very tenuous at best\"))", "Thus, a POSA would not have had a reasonable expectation of success from substituting an amine for a methylene in compound 31.", "Indeed, Dr. Roush identified other instances from Dr. Kohn's work in which substituting an amine with a methylene had a negative impact on drug performance.", "Thus, Defendants have failed to meet their burden under either prong of the lead compound analysis.", "iii. Objective Indicia of Obviousness Support Plaintiffs", "For the reasons already given above, the Court finds that the objective indicia support a finding of nonobviousness.", "Specifically, Plaintiffs have demonstrated that lacosamide was met with skepticism, satisfied a long-felt but unmet need for a segment of the population suffering from refractory epilepsy, demonstrated unexpected results, received praise, and was a commercial success.", "Plaintiffs also demonstrated that others failed to develop safe and effective AEDs. Although not necessary in order for Plaintiffs to prevail - given the Court's findings above, that Defendants have failed to meet their burden - these objective indicia contribute to and support the Court's decision that the asserted claims are nonobvious.", "See Hybritech Inc. v. Monoclonal Antibodies, Inc., 802 F.2d 1367, 1380 (Fed. Cir. 1986) (explaining that objective evidence \"must be considered before a conclusion on obviousness is reached and is not merely 'icing on the cake'\").", "Defendants contend that the LeGall Thesis anticipates claim 9 of the '551 patent. (OB at 17-19) Their argument is based on the contention that the description and/or production of a racemic mixture of compound 107e (with methoxymethyl at R3) necessarily discloses and anticipates the enantiomers of that mixture, including the R enantiomer, which is lacosamide.", "In Sanofi-Synthelabo v. Apotex, Inc., 550 F.3d 1075, 1084 (Fed. Cir. 2008), the Federal Circuit held that \"[t]he knowledge that enantiomers may be separated is not 'anticipation' of a specific enantiomer that has not been separated, identified, and characterized.\"", "Similarly, in In re May, 574 F.2d 1082, 1090 (C.C.P.A. 1978), the Court of Customs and Patent Appeals - a predecessor to the Federal Circuit - held that \"the novelty of an optical isomer is not negated by the prior art disclosure of its racemate.\"", "Defendants' attempts to distinguish these cases are unavailing.", "Defendants' arguments that Sanofi is somehow limited to its facts, and that the anticipation claim there was rejected on enablement grounds, are unsupported by a plain reading of Sanofi and the underlying district court opinion it affirmed.", "Defendants also argue that Sanofi is inapplicable because the prior art in this case expressed a specific preference for the R-enantiomer.", "But the LeGall Thesis did not express a preference for the R-enantiomer. While other prior art did disclose such a preference, anticipation must be based on a single piece of prior art.", "To the extent Defendants' argument is actually one of obviousness, the Court has considered and rejected their obviousness defenses.", "Defendants refer the Court to a line of cases holding that a prior art disclosure of a small genus anticipates each member of that genus.", "(See OB at 18 (citing cases)) These cases do not help Defendants meet their burden to show anticipation here.", "Compound 107e is not a genus - it is a mixture containing two components. Lacosamide is not a \"species\" or instance of compound 107e.", "All that the LeGall Thesis discloses about compound 107e is that it \"may have\" good anticonvulsant activity, not that it does have good anticonvulsant activity.", "(See DTX-2019 at DEF_245; FF 112) This speculation - which is not supported by any actual data - is based on an analogy to compound 86b.", "(Roush Tr. at 602) LeGall tested compound 86b, and found that it was six times less active than furan, a heteroaromatic compound that was the most promising of the compounds disclosed by LeGall.", "In fact, as Defendants' expert, Dr. Pleasure, confirmed, LeGall disclosed no efficacy data, no toxicity data, and no pharmacological data of any kind for compound 107e.", "(Pleasure Tr. at 303) Nor, as Dr. Pleasure admitted, does LeGall even suggest that 107e may have good pharmacokinetic properties, good safety, or minimal drug interaction.", "(Pleasure Tr. at 304) Nor does the LeGall Thesis disclose the R enantiomer - and the characteristics of this enantiomer were unknown in March 1996.", "Further undermining Defendants' contentions is the fact that Lily was aware of compound 107e (see FF 169) and decided not to pursue it.", "Instead, consistent with the teaching of the LeGall Thesis, Lilly selected furan - a heteroaromatic, unlike 107e - as a lead compound to test.", "Accordingly, the Court concludes that claim 9 of the '551 patent is not invalid due to anticipation.", "Defendants contend that the claim term \"therapeutic composition\" is indefinite and, therefore, claim 10 of the '551 patent is invalid due to indefiniteness.", "\"[A] patent is invalid for indefiniteness if its claims, read in light of the specification . . . and the prosecution history, fail to inform, with reasonable certainty, those skilled in the art about the scope of the invention.\"", "During the claim construction process, the parties disputed the meaning of \"therapeutic composition.\"", "The Court adopted Plaintiffs' proposed construction, which was: \"A composition suitable for use as a treatment regimen over an extended period of time (chronic administration).\"", "(D.I. 240 at 5) In reaching this decision, the Court rejected Defendants' contention that Plaintiffs' construction would render claim 10 invalid for indefiniteness.", "Defendants' principal argument was that a POSA would not know \"exactly how long\" a period is required to constitute \"chronic administration.\"", "(Id. at 11) The Court held that \"Defendants ha[d] not presented clear and convincing evidence showing that claim 10 is indefinite.\"", "At trial, Defendants raised this issue again, now relying on the testimony of Dr. Pleasure. (See Pleasure Tr. at 289-90)", "Dr. Pleasure's testimony does not alter the Court's conclusion. The Court's decision at claim construction was based on the intrinsic evidence, and that evidence has not changed.", "Dr. Pleasure's testimony does not overcome that intrinsic record. Moreover, it is undisputed that epilepsy is a chronic condition that requires long-term treatment.", "While Dr. Pleasure testified that a POSA would not \"know the objective boundaries\" of the \"extended period of time\" required by the claims (Pleasure Tr. at 289), the record is devoid of any evidence that a POSA would need \"clear guidelines\" or \"explicit guidance\" or \"the upper and lower limits\" in order to distinguish chronic administration from non-chronic administration.", "(Pleasure Tr. at 289-90) Defendants have failed to present clear and convincing evidence that a POSA would not know the scope of this claim term with \"reasonable certainty.\"", "To the contrary, the Court is persuaded that a POSA would have reasonable certainty as to what constitutes \"chronic administration\" in the context of claim 10 of the '551 patent.", "Again, then, the Court concludes that Defendants have failed to prove that claim 10 is invalid for indefiniteness.", "Finally, Defendants argue that the '551 patent is invalid because it was improperly reissued. In particular, Defendants contend that \"[b]ecause RCT 'made a deliberate choice to forgo the earlier filing date,' 'reissue [wa]s not an available remedy' to reclaim it, and the '551 patent is thus invalid.\"", "U.S. Patent App. No. 08/818,688 (the \"'688 Application\"), which resulted in U.S. Patent No. 5,733,475 (the \"'475 patent\"), was filed on Monday.", "March 17, 1997.

Plaintiffs' prosecuting attorney believed that he could wait until the next business day after the one-year anniversary - that is, until Monday, March 17, 1997 - before filing the '688 Application and still claim priority to the '522 Provisional.", "(Cohen Tr. at 338-39) At the time, however, the law prohibited a non-provisional application from claiming priority to a provisional application filed more than 12 months earlier, even if the 12-month period expired on a weekend or holiday.", "See 37 C.F.R. § 1.78(a)(3) (1996). This prohibition stood in contrast to the general PTO rule that PTO deadlines falling on a weekend or holiday are extended to the next business day.", "After the PTO Examiner informed the prosecuting attorney that the '688 Application could not lawfully claim priority to the '522 Provisional, the prosecuting attorney authorized withdrawing the prior claim.", "(Cohen Tr. at 339-40) Thereafter, in 1998, the '688 Application issued as the '475 patent.
