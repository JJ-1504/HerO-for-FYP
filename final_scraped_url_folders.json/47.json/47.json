Insulin’s role in improving infection in both clinical and nonclinical studies is also well known [62, 63].", "Insulin can attenuate systematic inflammatory responses and modulate immune functions of monocytes/macrophages, neutrophils, and T cells in the setting of sepsis and other disease states [64].", "From a physiologic and clinical perspective, there is no reason to believe that insulin should not remain our first therapeutic option for hyperglycemia during the COVID-19 pandemic, provided it can be administered and monitored safely while adequately protecting frontline staff.", "There has been discussion about roles of various diabetes medications in COVID-19 disease [65, 66]. Generally, oral medications are not recommended in the inpatient setting, however DPP-IV inhibitors have been considered for more regular use prior to the pandemic.", "Sulfonylureas/secretagogues have elevated risk of hypoglycemia, metformin is contraindicated in hypoxia/renal/hepatic dysfunction, SGLT2s increase risk of DKA, and GLPs hold significant risk of nausea/", "vomiting [67•].

The WHO has issued interim guidance on rational use of PPE for COVID-19, which includes implementation of prevention and mitigation measures and minimizing PPE need, while utilizing PPE appropriately [82].", "In addition, current and previous work (2003) in Taiwan has demonstrated decreased nosocomial severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) among HCW with implementation of their traffic control bundle (fever screening, separating SARS patients, increasing handwashing stations)", "Theoretically, decreasing face-to-face time could be one way to reduce HCW risk of infection, however this one factor or action cannot be undertaken or understood in isolation.", "In addition, this strategy does not take into account the increased risk of HCW infection when doffing PPE.", "Therefore, it would be prudent to try to minimize the frequency of glucose monitoring and insulin administration when possible, if this practice would truly decrease face-to-face time (i.e., nurses were not going into the room otherwise) without significantly compromising patient safety or glycemic outcomes.", "Bundling blood glucose monitoring, insulin administration, and meal tray delivery would keep within current recommendations while conserving staff exposure and PPE.", "Many institutions in the USA have converted some or all of their face-to-face DM consults by endocrinologists, fellows, and diabetes care and education specialists to telehealth encounters, especially in areas with high COVID-19 patient populations [85].", "With proper documentation of the visit in time segments, it is hoped that reimbursement will occur. Due to fluctuating guidance on reimbursement based on telehealth services in the USA, this will not be reviewed or taken into account in this document.", "Electronic glycemic management systems (both algorithm and/or personnel driven) have been shown to be effective for glycemic management in small and large hospital systems and could also be safely implemented [86, 87].", "Creative solutions to problems are being shared rapidly across sites, such as off-site clinicians placing orders or supporting new work teams to place insulin or glycemic related orders, to temporary practice changes such as keeping IV pumps outside the ICU hospital rooms so nurses do not have to enter the room to check alarms or adjust rates, and consideration of utilizing continuous glucose monitoring in select patients.", "Alternatives to intravenous insulin drips could be considered if needed (if there is a lack of IV pumps, insulin, staffing, and/or need for minimization of face-to-face time), in certain mild to moderate cases of hyperglycemia and/or DKA.", "In the UK and the USA for example, q4 hour dosing of rapid acting insulin algorithms have been created (based on weight and/or TDD), along with the addition of long-acting insulin for those with hyperglycemia when an insulin drip is not available [88, 89].", "Subcutaneous DKA protocols, with q4 dosing, from prior literature [90] and adapted for COVID-19 (additionally adapted for BMI, steroid use, glucose levels), have also been implemented [88, 89].", "In general, such protocols may not be appropriate for those with advanced glycemic disease (severe DKA and/or severe insulin resistance) unless deemed absolutely necessary based on lack of PPE or large patient volumes.", "Decisions on modifying existing DM/hyperglycemia protocols should be data driven when at all possible, as clinical care, safety parameters, plans for HCWs (including PPE availability), and COVID-19 case mix likely differ from region to region and institution to institution.", "Data such as number of patients with COVID-19, POI, regional location of such patients, nursing/care team staffing and workflows, amount and type of PPE available, and burn rate of PPE will all likely factor in on decision-making regarding changes in DM/hyperglycemia related protocols and workflows.", "The Potential Role of Continuous Glucose Monitoring in the COVID-19 Era", "One identified area of potential broadened use of technology in the COVID-19 era has been utilization of continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) in the hospital with the theoretical benefit to decrease face-to-face time.", "Dexcom and Abbott, at the time of this writing, have issued press releases regarding use of their products in the inpatient setting [91, 92].", "To this end, the FDA has recently put out guidance on the potential use of CGM in the hospital (https://www.fda.gov/medical-devices/blood-glucose-monitoring-devices/faqs-home-use-blood-glucose-meters-utilized-within-hospitals-during-covid-19-pandemic); the FDA has exercised “enforcement discretion” for hospital use of CGMs during the current pandemic, thereby temporarily sanctioning off label use.", "Some have interpreted this to mean the FDA has approved CGM use, which is not the case. In addition, CGM studies of hospitalized patients prior to COVID-19 have shown that circumstances commonly occurring in critically ill patients such as dehydration, edema, hypotension, and dialysis may negatively impact accuracy because of fluid shifts and changes in perfusion in this population", "[93].

The 19 percent increase translated to a revenue figure of $3.72 billion for 2018.", "That follows on the heels of a 16 percent rise in 2017’s revenue. From a real world perspective, the company’s technologies were used in more than 1 million procedures in 2018—an increase of 18 percent over the previous 12 months.", "Upon closer examination, it is apparent all segments of Intuitive contributed to the success and growth.", "The company’s Product revenue, which accounted for 83 percent of the firm’s total in 2018, was reported as $3.1 billion, a substantial increase over 2017’s $2.6 billion.", "Comprising the segment is Instruments and Accessories, which increased 20 percent to close at $2 billion.", "The other portion of Products is Systems, which saw revenue gain by 21 percent to finish the year at $1.13 billion.", "According to the company, a total of 926 da Vinci Surgical Systems were shipped during the year, which increased the robotic system’s installed base by 13 percent to a total of 4,986 systems.", "The Services portion of the company (representing 17 percent of total revenue) similarly contributed to the gains experienced during the year.", "The segment, which includes training and education for surgeons, posted $635 million in 2018 versus $573 million in 2017.", "ANALYST INSIGHTS: With many companies nipping at its heels, Intuitive Surgical just simply continues to deliver performance as it takes advantage of its market leadership to increase its footprint, which will make it more difficult for the coming competition to displace it.", "A key portfolio decision will be whether Intuitive Surgical will expand its robotic portfolio into other market segments or will it continue to focus in its core markets.", "The company still primarily serves the United States healthcare marketplace, seeing 71 percent of its total revenue from domestic sales.", "The rest of the world, which could prove to be an optimal area for growth, makes up the remainder. The U.S. revenue figure did decrease just a bit compared to the prior year, when it was 73 percent, but the almost 3:1 ratio has remained fairly consistent over the past three years.", "Perhaps with international growth at the top of its mind, the firm announced in 2018 it was beginning direct operations in India, having previously sold through a distributor in the region for seven years.", "“The adoption and advancement of robotic-assisted surgery has been enabled by critical contributions from health care professionals from India,” said Guthart.", "“As Intuitive continues to grow to serve patients, surgeons, and hospitals in India, we look forward to deepening our support of, and work with, health care professionals in their pursuit of the clinical and economic benefits robotic-assisted surgery offers.”", "The company also moved forward with a number of product advancements to ensure continued growth for the years to come.", "It gained FDA clearance for its SureForm 60—a single-patient use 60-mm stapler. The device boasted an industry-first 120 degrees of fully wristed articulation.", "The stapler can be used for general, thoracic, gynecologic, urologic, and pediatric procedures as part of the da Vinci system.", "The device represents an extension of the company’s line of 30-mm and 45-mm products.", "Also in 2018, the company saw the clearance of its da Vinci SP Surgical System, which presents a single port approach for surgeons.", "While the robotic system was cleared by the FDA in April 2014, this specific clearance was for urological procedures.", "According to a statement at the time of the announcement, the company anticipates pursuing further regulatory clearances for da Vinci SP, including transoral, transanal, and extraperitoneal applications, broadening the applicability of the platform over time.", "The SP system includes three multi-jointed wristed instruments and the first da Vinci fully wristed 3D HD camera.", "The instruments and camera all emerge through a single cannula and are properly triangulated around the target anatomy to avoid external instrument collisions that can occur in narrow surgical workspaces.", "“Intuitive continues to bring tomorrow’s surgery today by addressing surgeon and patient needs, as well as working closely with hospitals to systematically improve the overall experience in the operating room,” said Salvatore J. Brogna, Intuitive executive vice president and COO.", "Intuitive essentially cornered the surgical robot market since launching the first iteration of its da Vinci system back in 2000.", "Recently, however, some competition has emerged in a young surgical robotic company named TransEnterix.", "Last October, the N.C.-based firm won FDA clearance for the Senhance Surgical System. Cleared for colorectal and gynecological surgery, it is the first system to compete head-to-head with da Vinci.", "Further, TransEnterix’s stock surged upward upon the announcement, while Intuitive’s shares fell slightly as investors fretted over impending competition.", "Should Intuitive worry about the tiny contender? Senhance and da Vinci are comparable—both enable surgeons to conduct high-precision surgeries by operating robotic arms from workstations near the patient, and both target similar procedures.", "Unlike da Vinci, however, Senhance features haptic feedback—da Vinci systems instead incorporate a form of tactile-visual sensory substitution to display information through visual cues.", "Senhance can recreate the sense of touch felt by surgeons using traditional surgical instruments. Further, surgeons using Senhance can control the robotic arm-mounted camera by moving the eyes and head, and Senhance’s instruments are reusable.", "Hospitals would presumably not have to stock up on as many replacement instruments and accessories as with a da Vinci system.", "However, despite Senhance’s landmark FDA clearance and some alluring features, TransEnterix will have a tough battle to win against Intuitive.", "The company hasn’t made much progress in the global markets where da Vinci has already won approval, selling merely one unit in Germany and one in Japan in the first half of 2017.", "Assuaging some Intuitive fears, TransEnterix CEO Todd Pope said the company had “a lot of ground to cover” to compete directly with da Vinci in an interview with Reuters.", "“We feel like we have got a lot of open field running ahead of us,” he said. “We are not going to be competing head-on with Intuitive.”", "Analysts do not expect TransEnterix to chase the urological or prostate indications that Intuitive specializes in.", "Rather, Pope said the company would seek to convert delicate laparoscopic surgery, which is significantly wearing on surgeons, over to Senhance.", "Intuitive should instead be worrying about Medtronic’s entry into the market. The global medical device giant’s revenue is 10 times that of Intuitive, and Medtronic plans to roll out its own surgical robot at some point this year.", "Although the global firm could face similar challenges to TransEnterix in gaining market entry, its size and stability as well as long-term relationships with hospitals could allow it to take at least some market share from Intuitive over time.", "Johnson & Johnson has also been teasing the public about entering the surgical robotics field by way of Verb Surgical, its long-heralded joint venture with Verily Life Sciences.", "ANALYST INSIGHTS: Intuitive Surgical continues to benefit from being a ‘first-mover’ in surgical robotics.", "While many others (J&J, Google, Medtronic, etc.) are investing and trying to ‘catch up,’ Intuitive continues to simply execute and to increase its hospital ‘footprint.’", "This will make it more difficult for the follow-on competitors to penetrate into their market share. Time to market is currently an advantage for this incumbent.", "—Dave Sheppard, Co-Founder and Principal, MedWorld Advisors", "Intuitive’s 2017 fiscal year performance (year ended Dec. 31) ought to ease some of that apprehension, however.", "Shares of the company reached an all-time high last April after the da Vinci surgery robot maker reported first-quarter earnings and sales that beat analyst estimates—$5.09 of earnings on sales of $674 million for that quarter—which topped Thomson Reuters estimates of $4.93 on sales of $669.7 million.", "According to CNBC, Intuitive shipped 133 of its da Vinci systems during the first quarter, compared to 110 delivered in Q1 of 2016.", "Intuitive was able to sustain that impressive pace for the full year. The firm posted 2017 revenue of $3.1 billion, soaring nearly 15 percent upward over the previous year.", "This year’s surge in sales is a continuation of a very profitable trend for Intuitive. The company had also posted double digit revenue expansion in 2016, rising 13 percent from the year prior.", "In fact, nearly every facet of Intuitive’s business boasted double-digit hikes in 2017. Instruments and accessories revenue grew 17 percent to $1.6 billion, systems sales escalated 15 percent to $910 million, and services income upturned 13 percent to reach $582 million.", "Much of this windfall was a result of a 16 percent boost in the use of da Vinci systems and a 13 percent rise in the installed system base—from 3,919 to 4,409 by the year’s end.", "da Vinci sales outside the United States also ballooned a whopping 23 percent from the previous year.", "Gynecology proved to be Intuitive’s largest U.S. specialty in 2017, with about 252,000 procedures performed.", "General surgery applications followed not far behind with approximately 246,000 operations, most of which were ventral or inguinal hernia repair procedures.", "da Vinci’s use in colorectal procedures in 2017 grew as well, thanks to 2016’s launch of the da Vinci Xi system, EndoWrist Stapler and Vessel Sealer, and Integrated Table Motion.", "The latest in Intuitive’s surgical robot iterations, the da Vinci X Surgical System, also won CE mark approval last April, and the FDA cleared it for use last May.", "da Vinci X uses the same vision cart and surgeon console found on the flagship da Vinci Xi system, and allows users to customize with whichever advanced capabilities and upgrade pathways their practice requires.", "The new surgical robot enables focused-quadrant procedures like prostatectomy, hernia repair, and benign hysterectomy, touting flexible port placement and 3D digital optics.", "da Vinci X’s setup technology also features voice and laser guidance, drape design to simplify surgical preparations, and a lightweight, fully integrated endoscope.", "“The da Vinci X System is a value-oriented option for hospitals that are just starting their robotic-assisted surgical program and for our existing customers who want to expand their existing robotics programs,” said Henry Charlton, Intuitive’s senior vice president of U.S. sales.", "“As customers’ needs grow, the da Vinci X System can grow with them.

Part of the underperformance in public health arises from the fact that an estimated 25% of aggregate health care spending in the United States is wasted,6 an alarmingly high number compared with other sectors of the economy, depressing health care return on investment (ROI), and its economic viability and sustainability—critical cushions during periods of significant stress.", "Moreover, the pandemic has exposed interconnected crises in health insurance, financial losses for providers, racial and ethnic disparities, and overall public health infrastructure.7 In the earlier stages of the pandemic, estimates of the added direct medical cost burden due to COVID-19 ranged from ∼$160B (20% of the population infected) to ∼$650B (80% of the population infected) over the course of the entire pandemic, with a cost estimate of a single course of infection totaling ∼$3K.8 Given ∼10% of the U.S. population has diabetes,9 we could impute an incremental spend between $16B (20% infected) and $65B (80% infected) attributable just to this population, which represents between 5% and 20%, respectively, of overall diabetes expenditure.10 If we assume that 80% of the population will become infected as a worst-case scenario and that is more representative of estimates of the threshold for herd immunity given current transmission rates, can we then allocate the incremental 20% of diabetes-specific spending to achieve outcomes above and beyond saving lives and avoiding waste, thereby creating opportunity (i.e., ROI) in the midst of crisis?", "We believe this to be a central question writ large for policy makers and the overall health care system.", "This question also looms large when considering socioeconomic and racial/ethnic disparities exposed by the pandemic.", "The “social determinants of health care” are not new phenomena and are multifaceted.

In the earlier days of the pandemic, congress authorized telemedicine services for all beneficiaries of fee-for-service Medicare as an initial step, but wider adoption is contingent on aligning on reimbursement protocols, updating regulations, and evaluating clinical care provided by such technologies.15 Nonetheless, the results have been impressive: telemedicine use has surged from pre-40% penetration to >60%, large employers were citing 30%–40% utilization rates in April and industry publications have cited a 30 × increase in broader telemedicine utilization, and the Teledoc/Livongo merger was consummated as a poster child of the new digital revolution.16 The health care sector and capital markets are clearly favoring companies and organizations using technology", "not just as an enabling platform, but also as a central driver of business value. As a result, management teams and leaders are adjusting in real time: ∼60% of health care industry leaders say that flexible/hybrid office–home work will become a staple; 51% say there will be greater focus on automation, technology, and data analytics;

An earlier pilot study tested the feasibility of CGM in the hospital for noncritically ill COVID-19 patients and found high accuracy and reduced POC testing.54 Shehav-Zaltzman et al. described the use of CGM in two hospital isolation wards where monitoring stations were created using CGM systems.55 They found CGM for remote real-time diabetes management feasible and added to the quality of care while minimizing health care work exposure risk.", "A case report on a severely ill patient with diabetes and pneumonia caused by COVID-19 demonstrated successful use of Dexcom G4 rtCGM for remote monitoring of the patient to track glucose levels from outside the patient's isolation room.56 These studies emphasized the added infrastructure needs for safe implementation of CGM in the hospital, including staff education, establishing protocols for device placement and replacement, monitoring device accuracy, and integrating CGM readings into the medical record.57", "Heeding Churchill's famous admonition for future generations to “never let a good crisis go to waste,” we conclude by discussing ways in which the changes wrought by COVID-19 from a health care, policy, and economics perspective are likely to endure long after the pandemic subsides.", "If the operative question for society is how to achieve meaningful ROI in the midst of crisis, to see that the incremental 20% health care spend attributable to COVID-19 and diabetes leads to sustainable change that makes medical practice more efficient and equitable, then we believe the winner in this whole experience will be the accelerated use and adoption of technology as the de facto “new normal” post-COVID-19.", "First, from a health care and policy perspective, clearly the twin rise of telehealth services in medicine broadly and the use of rtCGM in the diabetes market specifically as discussed in this article have demonstrated their value proposition to providers, patients, payers, and regulators.", "All of the R&D investment that such technologies are leveraging has been put to the test in the most exigent of circumstances and shown safety and efficacy across nearly every performance indicator.", "Although industry and the clinic seem to have moved forward in technology adoption, as well as the overall marketplace, regulators and policy makers will need to carefully articulate the appropriate guardrails and safeguards for such technologies to ensure compliance, mitigate abuse, maintain safety standards, and encourage future innovation.", "This approach would ensure that today's inflection point in technology will not be undercut by intractable privacy or security concerns and would rather continue the journey toward a more technology-enabled and efficient future in health care delivery and practice.", "Moreover, the pandemic has acutely highlighted health care disparities based on socioeconomic factors, an area where technology could have a significant positive impact if deployed strategically and with appropriate regulatory backing.58 For example, CMS has loosened requirements for obtaining CGM during the COVID-19 pandemic such as not having to go to the doctor's office to receive CGM and not having to demonstrate use of four finger sticks a day, a requirement for CGM eligibility.", "Making these regulatory changes permanent will help increase access to CGM for those who can benefit from the technology.", "In addition, even though, at present, 35 states provide some coverage for CGM through Medicaid, expanding Medicaid coverage for CGM to all states for patients taking insulin for diabetes will help to close socioeconomic disparity gaps for those in the United States without private health insurance.", "Beyond policy change for reimbursement of health technologies such as CGM, disparities in access to health technologies continue to exist when access to diabetes specialists and diabetes educators is limited in areas of socioeconomic deprivation.59", "Second, by virtue of their forward-looking orientation, the capital markets and investment community have already moved forward in assigning winners and losers in the post-COVID-19 world.", "The winners are indisputably companies and organizations that place technology at the center of what they do—consider that over the past year, at the time of this writing, the S&P Technology Index is up 44% while the S&P 500 overall index is up 18%, and that all of the equity market growth this year has been driven by large-cap technology companies.60 Stock markets are forward-looking barometers of risk and help reveal the market consensus on future trends.", "As another example of what the post-COVID-19 world will look like, Salesforce announced on 12/1 its acquisition of Slack Technologies, a business communications and virtual workload software tool, for $28 billion.61 That this transaction would be announced 9 months into a global pandemic and would represent the largest ever acquisition by Salesforce, a $200B market cap global technology leader, underscores the gravity of the secular change envisioned in technology use in the new world post-COVID-19.", "As we have discussed, these changes are also bearing fruit in the health care world, where the growth in the reliance on technology to provide care during the pandemic is changing incumbent ways of doing business and will likely lead to positive ROI.", "At the Cleveland Clinic, for example, the population health analytics team is using algorithms proactively to reduce COVID-19 hospitalizations by 7.5%, geomapping COVID-19 exposures to determine hotspots before even health officials have such data on their radar, and using technology to enable value-based work at scale.62 Similarly, we have highlighted successful use cases of rtCGM during the pandemic to manage diabetes safely and effectively, which can continue to add value post-COVID-19.", "We envision more such success stories across the health care landscape and in diabetes especially.

"Adding CSII would have no effect on life-expectancy in the high baseline HbA1c subgroup but would shorten life expectancy (−1.28 years) in the low HbA1c subgroup.", "In sensitivity analyses, the results were not significantly altered with the removal of the negative quality of life effect of CSII.", "In the past decade, diabetes management for many patients with T1D has been transformed by new technologies such as CGM and CSII, but the high costs of these devices is a barrier to adoption.", "Although many patients may adopt CGM and CSII individually, together, or in different sequences, economic evaluations of innovations in CGM and insulin pumps have been limited to studies of individual devices compared to usual care.", "Our study is the first to examine the economic value of a particular sequence of adoption of technologies in adults with T1D, namely the adoption of CSII after the adoption of CGM.", "The within-trial CEA found that adding CSII to CGM users increased costs, reduced quality of life, worsened glucose control (higher HbA1c), and increased NSHEs.", "Extrapolating these results, the lifetime CEA found that adding CSII would increase costs and cause overall clinical harm.", "In this trial, CSII did not improve glucose control compared to MDI for the overall trial population as one would expect from pump use.", "One possible explanation for this finding is that the overall trial results mask the distinct and complex experiences of patients with high and low baseline HbA1c.", "15 In the high baseline HbA1c group (≥7.5%), pump use appeared to improve glucose control by increasing time-in-range and reducing HbA1c modestly over time (about 0.3% DiD at 3 months, not significant at 6 months).", "However, the addition of pump use did concurrently increase NSHEs38 which are associated with reduced quality of life.39,40 These findings in HbA1c in the high baseline HbA1c subgroup are consistent with those of three metaanalyses of numerous studies comparing CSII to MDI in adults with T1D without use of CGM (mean HbA1c difference of 0.30%, 0.37% and 0.30%, respectively).6,9,41", "On the other hand, in CGM users with low baseline HbA1c (<7.5%), adding a pump worsened glycemic control.", "In this subgroup, the mean baseline HbA1c was 6.94 ± 0.40% (ranged: 6.0 % to 7.4%), with at least 50% having an HbA1c < 7.0%.", "As a result, the opportunity to improve glycemic control was far smaller and the burdens of adding a pump might have been more prominent.", "The second potential reason for the overall trial findings is that the trial lacked a standardized and solid training method for introduction of CSII for the multicenter study.", "As the American Diabetes Association recommends, pump use requires care by skilled professionals, careful selection of patients, meticulous patient monitoring, and thorough patient education.42 More rigorous pump training could have resulted in greater benefit for the CGM+CSII group.15", "The third possible reason is that the trial was not powered to assess HbA1c effect, especially, in the small subgroup with high baseline HbA1c (≥7.5%).", "The two DIAMOND trials (CGM+MDI vs. SMBG+MDI43; CSII+CGM vs. MDI+CGM15) suggest that the decision to adopt CGM has a greater clinical benefit than the decision to adopt CSII.", "This is consistent with recent studies of glucose monitoring and/or insulin delivery methods in patients with T1D.44,45 The COMISAIR study45 compared the four glucose monitoring and insulin delivery combinations (CSII+CGM, MDI+CGM, CSII+SMBG, and MDI+SMBG), and found that the CSII+CGM and MDI+CGM groups both had very similar improvements in glucose control over a year from a mean baseline HbA1c of 8.3%.", "Both CGM groups had improvements in glucose control and reductions in hypoglycemia that were greater than those with CSII+SMBG.", "The SWITCH study44 found that in patients already using CSII, adding CGM led to an improvement in glucose control, while removal of CGM resulted in a loss of the benefit.", "Overall, CGM is the primary driver of improved clinical outcomes.15,44,45", "Our CEA findings are distinct from past economic evaluations of CSII because our analyses are based on a trial where all patients used CGM which likely altered the potential benefits of CSII.", "Our results are most similar to the recent CEA of CSII based on the REPOSE cluster randomized controlled trial46 and the economic evaluation study of CSII using data from national member enrollment files and healthcare claims by Ackermann et al.47 REPOSE compared insulin pump therapy to MDI, with both sets of patients using insulin analogues and receiving high-quality structured training.", "The REPOSE study concluded that insulin pump therapy did not provide significant improvement in glucose control compared with MDI, and that extending the availability of pumps to adults with T1D is unlikely to be cost-effective.", "The long-term ICER in this study was £149,483/QALY. Ackermann’s economic evaluation study found that adults with T1D, transitioning from MDI to CSII, had modest improvements in HbA1c (0.46% in 2 years and 0.32% in 3 years) but more hypoglycemia encounters which increased total annual healthcare expenditures by $6856.47 The findings of our CEA, the REPOSE study, and the Ackermann study conflict with a number of earlier CEA studies that concluded that CSII compared to MDI may be beneficial and cost-effective in adults with T1D.48–50 The ICERs from these studies ranged from $12,237 to $34,336/QALY.", "These studies used data from the clinical findings of a meta-analysis of CSII published in 2003;51 the meta-analysis concluded that treatment with CSII for 1 year or greater was associated with a mean reduction in baseline HbA1c of 1.2% ± 0.2%, and a mean increase in BMI of 1.03 kg/m2, compared with MDI.", "A number of secular changes in diabetes care may explain why CSII in both the DIAMOND and REPOSE studies demonstrated negative or smaller clinical effects than the older trials included in this meta-analysis.", "The older studies were all performed in an era that preceded the wide availability of insulin analogues and continuous glucose monitoring.", "It is also likely that the baseline quality of diabetes care has improved over time52 as physicians have more aggressively pursued intensive glucose control (HbA1c level of < 7.0%) following the publication of the Diabetes Control and Complications Trial in 1993.2", "In contrast to studies of CSII, CGM consistently appears to be cost-effective in adults with T1D using MDI,26 (including a recent CEA study based on the recent DIAMOND trial)53 or insulin pumps as found in the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation trial where a majority of trial participants were pump users (>80%).11 The integrated CSII/CGM therapy (i.e., CGM+CSII) likely represents a cost-effective treatment option relative to CSII alone,54 as well as a cost-effective alternative to MDI without CGM.55", "Our study has limitations. First, as mentioned above, the main limitation of the DIAMOND trial is that the introduction of CSII was not accompanied by standardized methods for pump training and individual clinical sites were allowed to introduce the pump as per their usual practice.", "42 Second, the study was also not designed and powered to detect an effect for clinical outcomes (such as HbA1c) other than time-in-range.", "Larger, longer-term studies, especially among patients with HbA1c ≥ 7.5% are needed. The third limitation relates to the survey question of time devoted to self-management: “How many hours per day do you currently devote to managing your glucose levels (i.e., looking at your glucose levels, modifying your meals and/or your insulin doses).”", "Some trial patients considered CGM use as time devoted to managing their glucose levels, and consequently answered more than 12 hours a day.", "This question may not have been specific enough to capture accurate information about self-management time.", "Fourth, we were not able to incorporate the clinical benefits of increased time-in-range in the lifetime model.", "None of the existing lifetime T1D models in the literature consider time-in-range which future work should explore.", "Finally, an appropriate disutility value of a NSHE was difficult to ascertain due to diverse definitions of NSHEs within a limited literature.", "Prior studies of the QoL effects of NSHEs were based on either life with/without symptomatic hypoglycemia or the experience of a single symptomatic hypoglycemic event.56–58 These patient-reported definitions are distinct from the new international definition (<54mg/dL for ≥ 20 successive minutes)19, derived from CGM, that has a higher frequency than past definitions and is frequently asymptomatic.", "In conclusion, based on this trial, for adults with T1D already using CGM, initiating insulin pump use increased costs and reduced quality of life.", "This suggests that the sequence of adoption of distinct technologies may have unexpected effects on the value of individual technologies.", "Additional evidence regarding the adoption of multiple technologies from trials and real-world populations are needed to confirm these findings.", "Section of General Internal Medicine, University of Chicago, Chicago (Wan, Skandari, Minc, Nathan, Zarei, Huang); Department of Health Policy and Management, University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill (Winn); National Opinion Research Center, University of Chicago, Chicago (O’Grady); Center for Translational and Policy Research of Chronic Diseases, University of Chicago, Chicago (Wan, Skandari, Minc, Nathan, Zarei, Huang).", "Funding Source*: This study was supported by grants from Dexcom, the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases ((P30 DK092949, K24 DK105340 (Dr. Huang)), and the Royster Society of Fellowship at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill (Dr. Winn).", "*The funding agreements ensured the authors’ independence in designing the study, interpreting the data, writing, and publishing the report.", "Nobody in the author list is employed by the sponsors.", "The funders had no role in study design, data collection and analysis, decision to publish, or preparation of the manuscript.", "Conflict of Interest Disclosures: All authors have no financial/commercial conflicts of interests.", "Acquisition, analysis, or interpretation of data: All authors.", "Critical revision of the manuscript for important intellectual content: All authors.", "Administrative, technical, or material support: All authors.", "- 1.Nathan DM, Group DER.

A rapidly emerging, and often essential, part of health care involves the growth of information and communications technologies (ICTs)", "[1,2]. Electronic health, or eHealth, encompasses a remarkably wide range of interpretations related to health care [3,4] and ICTs", "[5,6], with one study documenting over 50 uniquely different definitions for the term “eHealth,” such as the application of e-commerce to health care and pharmaceuticals, the use of new media technologies for social policy, and the integration of the Internet into health care [7].", "Such diverse interpretations can lead to multiple operational definitions of eHealth, negatively influencing generalizability of study results", "[8]. This is complicated by alternative terms appearing in the literature and in practice, with those terms also evolving as the technology changes.", "For example, the United States federal government and other agencies use the terms “telemedicine” and “telehealth” to generally refer to applications of ICTs in the practice of medicine, but are attempting to reach consensus on the use of the terms [9].", "In one bibliographic analysis, the term “telemedicine” was used more than “eHealth” in English-speaking countries, whereas “eHealth” was more popular in non–English-speaking countries; “eHealth” is trending at a higher rate overall [10,11].", "Therefore, any analysis or review of telemedicine, telehealth, or eHealth programs must be cautious when comparing outcomes, as there are interpretations supported by the definitions, the types and implementations of the technology, and how it was used in the particular health intervention context.", "These should not be treated as exogenous factors. Within this terminology health care, individual, clinical, and public health are often confounded, thus covering a wide range of health application contexts including financial and business sectors [12].", "Regardless of the broader terms (eHealth, telemedicine, telehealth), one term has emerged and tends to refer to a specific class of technologies and the associated ways in which the class is used with respect to health—mobile smart phone telephony or mHealth.", "In this paper, we briefly examine the etymology of the term “mHealth,” followed by an examination of technologies used in mHealth.", "Then, we describe core characteristics of mHealth’s current technologies in terms of their potential relevance for the general “health of the public” which has implications for health care at large, to the localities of health practice, and to individualization of information, clinical care, and behavioral intervention.", "We present this paper as augmenting other discussions regarding strategies taking mHealth forward [13,14].", "As mHealth evolves in methods for engaging in prevention, care, treatment, and monitoring of health, these characteristics will help guide development toward more effective and efficient health solutions.", "As ICTs evolve in their forms, capacity, and presence, these characteristics will help health professionals instantiate components of their health solutions to realize their health goals.", "In short, this paper addresses the following question: What are the core characteristics of mHealth and why are they important?", "mHealth typically includes applications in both public health and clinical medicine, so the distinction can be blurred.", "In clinical medicine, mHealth includes health costs, health delivery, Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) or health information technology, and health telematics [15,16].", "Although no standard definition of mHealth exits, both the World Health Organization and National Institutes of Health have offered reasonable and overlapping definitions of mHealth consistent with the view in this paper.", "Table 1 includes additional agency definitions. mHealth generally involves the use of mobile phones which, depending on the particular phone, directly support audio, video, photography, geolocation, sensors (proximity infrared, touch, accelerometer, ambient light illuminance, humidity, three-axis gyroscope, temperature, magnetometer, geomagnetic, ultraviolet exposure, light spectral, gestural-infrared, barometer, pedometer, pulsometer, heart rate, radiation detection), Internet or Web access, and various forms of texting, with locally running mostly third-party applications, or “apps,” as the emerging terminology standard [17].", "| Word Health Organization | mHealth involves the use of and capitalization on a mobile phone’s core utility of voice and short messaging service (SMS) as well as more complex functionalities and apps including general packet radio service (GPRS), third and fourth generation mobile telecommunications (3G and 4G systems), global positioning system (GPS), and Bluetooth technology [28].", "| US National Insitutes of Health | At NIH, we think about this really as diverse application of wireless and mobile technologies designed to improve health research, health care services, and health outcomes, and I think this is really important because it is not just mobile phones.", "You can think of it as sensors, any kind of sensors you can think of [29]. |", "| US Federal Communications Commission | The use of mobile networks and devices in supporting e-care.", "Emphasizes leveraging health-focused applications on general-purpose tools such as mobile phones and SMS to drive active health participation by consumers and clinicians [30].", "| US Department of Health and Human Services | The use of wireless technologies, such as mobile phones, personal digital assistants, and netbooks, for improving health", "| mHealth Working Group | mHealth is the use of mobile technologies in public health and health service settings [32].", "| European Coordination Committee of the Radiological, Electromedical and Healthcare IT Industry (COCIR) | COCIR regards mHealth as a subset of eHealth and defines it as the provision of eHealth services and information that relies on mobile and wireless technologies", "| Adopted by mHealth Regulatory Coalition | Programs (apps) that deliver health-related services using mobile phones and tablets.", "Some apps offer advice and tracking functionality for healthy living. Some are designed to transmit information between doctors and patients (eg, glucose readings for diabetes management)", "Ancillary devices can be connected to mobile phones, including “watches and bands,” and communicate with the apps to provide unique and often innovative capabilities, such as blood pressure monitors, pulse oximeters, blood glucose meters, environmental exposure measures (for asthmatics), microscope for remote diagnoses, single lead electrocardiogram (ECG), sleep monitor, and an ingestible biomedical sensor", "[18], or integration with existing devices that can communicate with apps such as Google and Novartis’s “smart” contact lens that also monitors blood sugar", "[19,20].

New telemedicine or telehealth mHealth apps are emerging as a consequence of policy (eg, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, economic returns or displacements, regulatory structures), business opportunities, and technological innovations [23-26].", "This is especially prominent with devices adept at exploiting the capabilities of mobile phones [27].", "Advancements in the mHealth infrastructure are bolstered by support of the underlying operating system (OS) technology in mobile phones.", "In September 2014, Apple Health’s HealthKit platform released with the iOS 8 systems development kit (SDK) offered a set of integrated software to collect specific types of health data, allowing developers to create iPhone apps that directly interact with the OS’s health-related, built-in resources to securely acquire, retain, and transmit health data.", "After a rocky start [35,36,37], Apple strategically collaborated with the Mayo Clinic [38], Nike [39], and Ochsner Health System [40].", "The latter was significant as it also included partnering with Epic Systems to integrate their electronic health record (EHR) with HealthKit, a leading EHR vendor handling approximately 53% Americans’ EHRs [41].", "Other leading health centers, such as Stanford and Duke, quickly followed by launching clinical trials using HealthKit, 14 hospitals piloting HealthKit for institutional data integration, and at least 600 HealthKit-based apps were developed [42,43].", "Apple and IBM announced a partnership to build enterprise mobility apps, bringing IBM’s experience in data analytics and health care to Apple’s mobile iPhone and iPad platforms [44,45].", "With the introduction of iOS 9, the iPhone provided wider support for women’s health issues [46,47] and iOS 10 supports Health Level 7 (HL7) standard for Continuity of Care Documents, which is the EHR standard for data exchange [48].", "In March 2015, Apple released ResearchKit, an open source software framework that facilitates app development in the context of medical research studies [49].", "ResearchKit has an integrated informed consent module, capturing a participant’s signature, and a customizable user interface, allowing data capture such as tacit data from sensors, from user-engaged active tasks, and from surveys, then uploads data to a server for retention and data analyses.", "By all accounts, ResearchKit’s focus on clinical research and researchers has been quite successful, as it addressed several difficulties that HealthKit encountered with this target group.", "For example, ResearchKit facilitates the “remote” acquisition of participants, their consent, and their data for clinical trials [50,51].", "Recently, ResearchKit has been updated to now accommodate genetic data from 23andMe [52].", "Finally, in March 2016, Apple has introduced CareKit, a framework for building apps that “enable people to actively manage their own medical conditions” especially patients and their caregivers, including core modules to track their health-related events (eg, taking medication, conducing physical therapy) and track their own feelings and symptoms (eg, surveys, photos, motion quantification, temperature)", "[53]. Unlike HealthKit, which addresses basic health tracking (eg, exercise, food intake, weight), or ResearchKit, which is more a “connection to participants and their data” type of research facilitator processes, CareKit has a patient-centered focus, offering an Insight Dashboard that maps symptoms into action items, and connectivity to physicians, care teams, and family members targeting chronic conditions, such as home monitoring of Parkinson’s disease, and postsurgical care [53].", "Samsung’s Android S Health activity tracking app, once available only on Samsung mobile phones, is now available in the online Play Store for all Android phones, though functionality is dependent on available sensors.", "S Health offers its own Digital Health SDK [54], with more of a nuance toward fitness and health, like Google Fit [55].", "Separately, Samsung has partnered with the University of California, San Francisco, and imec (a leading biosensing research institute) for the Samsung Digital Health Initiative, which includes a new open reference design platform for health (Samsung Architecture Multimodal Interactions) as a data broker across apps, and a wearable technology reference design, Simband, based on its Gear watch design [56].", "Simband is hardware designed from the ground up as a true digital health device. However, it is not yet a directly commercial product, but is a flexible reference device, based on the Linux-based Tizen standards–based software platform, for different types and collections of sensors, such as ECG, galvanic skin response, bio-impedence, photoplethysmogram, and other or new types generating unique data streams that can be integrated (and analyzed) across multiple devices by third party developers [57].", "Finally, Google has entered the market with an initial version of the Google Fit SDK with the release of Android 5.0 Lollipop, offering developers support for sensor data acquisition (phone-based and attached wearables), cloud-synced data collection-backup, and history presentation-tracking [58], but likely to be integrated with Android Wear devices [59].", "Google is also partnering with the Mayo Clinic on constructing and reviewing medical information in their Knowledge Graph system for answering health-related queries on the Web using “rich content” data", "[60,61]. This is consistent with Google’s mission statement, “to organize the world's information and make it universally accessible and useful.”", "It also reflects the Pew Research findings that 72% of US Internet users look on the Web for health information, 77% of those start with a generic Internet search using a search engine, and 35% of US adults have attempted diagnosis from Web-based information [62].", "Furthermore, the number of search queries made on mobile devices has overtaken desktop search queries [63].", "In parallel, Google’s parent company, Alphabet, formed Verily Life Sciences (formerly Google Life Sciences) for biomedical research, is developing wearable technologies beyond fitness trackers that directly address data needs of medical professionals and evidences a shift to a disease-centric focus, such as their “capicola” wrist-mounted health tracker, partnering with Novartis to develop glucose monitoring contact lenses, to treat and manage diabetes", "The implications for mHealth for these types of integrated health platforms are only beginning to be realized, but Apple has taken the lead in hospital pilot programs, many of which involve close (but remotely) tracking and management of individuals’ conditions [42,52].", "Two major factors motivate the growth of mHealth apps. First, the overall general movement of health prevention likely drives demand, which is fueled by a combination of individual concerns for health as well as economic incentives, such as health care reform reimbursement mechanisms for physicians and support for wellness programs.", "There is increased value in acquiring personal activity and health data for individual awareness, growth of wellness programs in the workplace, and physician utility in individualization of health care advising, especially for costly chronic diseases [67].", "Second, health care organizations are concerned about operational inefficiencies and outcome improvement.", "Data acquisition, movement, integration with EHRs, and cloud-based analytics within health care organizations are a critical part of operational and outcome-based concerns, leading to a projection that 65% of consumer transactions with health care organizations and practitioners will be mobile by 2018 [68].", "As the health technology landscape is rapidly, constantly, and unpredictably changing, we suggest that successful mHealth engagements can benefit by (1) focusing on the core characteristics of mobile phone technology and (2) understanding how these characteristics are successfully engaged and integrated.", "Mobile phone technology is often essential for improving the effectiveness and efficiency of achieving health goals for individuals, groups, states, or nations.", "We suggest that the leading core characteristics of mHealth are the following: (1) penetration into populations, (2) availability of apps, (3) wireless broadband access to the Internet, and (4) tethered to individuals.", "The core characteristics are summarized in Table 2. Many capabilities are built upon these characteristics such as social network communication structures, data acquisition mechanisms, and varieties of functional apps.", "Furthermore, these capabilities exist in “layers” where capabilities are built on other capabilities (eg, social networking functionality built on collective use of specific apps and Internet access tethered to individuals, health apps are built on the underlying functionality of the OS and hardware) or “assemblies” where functionality is based on devices attached physically (hardware) or electronically (software).", "Not all characteristics are equally available to all populations at equal levels of service. State-level statistics often do not reflect the heterogeneity of technological forms and access within its borders.", "However, mobile telephony with Internet access is the most rapidly developing and spreading form of telecommunication-computational technology.", "It is a small and increasingly powerful computer with a radio attached that you can fit into your pocket.", "Given the correct infrastructure, it can communicate rapidly with individuals and things around the world.", "| Representative topics | Health care implications |", "| Penetration into populations | Unprecedented communication access to population and subgroups, possible differential access by subgroups, differential mobile phone capability or dependence by subgroups |", "| Availability of apps | General purpose computational capabilities of increasing sophistication of functionality and data acquisition, reporting, local analysis; ease of access to apps; increasing number of health-related devices connected to mobile phones |", "| Wireless broadband access to the Internet | Access to full Internet resources; increasing sophistication, amount, and speed of communication in general, and data communication in particular; external device connectivity; Internet of things (devices) capable of direct Internet communications |", "| Tethered to individuals | Decreasing delays in communication with specific individuals; tailoring to, and data captured by and about, individuals; location, physiological and psychology states, behavioral, and context awareness |", "Core Characteristic 1—Penetration Into Populations", "The first core characteristic of mobile phone technology is its penetration into populations in the United States and around the world, affording substantially higher basic connectivity and connectivity quality (eg, reach, continuity of service, reduced connectivity delays).", "Wireless penetration in the United States is estimated at 110 mobile phone subscriptions per 100 population [69] and estimates place the ownership of mobile phones by American adults approaching 80% [70,71].", "In 2015, the Center for Disease Control and Prevention’s National Health Interview Survey reported over 47% of American homes were wireless only (meaning they had neither cabled phone nor cabled Internet access), where 55.3% of homes with children are wireless only [72].", "Note that such figures vary across reporting agencies depending on the usual factors, such as timing, sampling, operational definitions, and methodological differences.", "Globally, the International Telecommunications Union (ITU) estimates that the mobile phone penetration rate is 96.8% for the world population, 120.6% for developed countries, and developing countries at 91.8%.", "The number of world mobile phone subscriptions (ie, the number of SIM cards used in each country) is roughly equivalent to the world population", "[73] and the number of subscriptions exceed the total population in several counties in Central and Eastern Europe, Western Europe, Latin American, Middle East, North American, and Asia Pacific, excluding India and China [74].", "Both penetration and type of access vary widely. For example, although Africa has an average penetration rate of 69%, sub-Saharan Africa’s sovereign states range from 40% to 96% in households that have at least one mobile phone and represent the second largest mobile technology market after Asia [75].", "In South Africa and Nigeria, mobile phone ownership by adults is almost equivalent to ownership in the United States, but smartphone ownership in sub-Saharan Africa lags behind from a high of 34% in South Africa to a low of 8% in Tanzania and 5% in Uganda", "[76]. Similar situations exist in South America, where mobile phone penetration is generally high, but smartphone penetration lags, and sometimes substantially.", "For example, consider the 2015 estimated rate for mobile phone penetration (% of population with device) versus smartphone penetration (% of population who have mobile phones) in the following countries, respectively, is: in Chile (73.3%, 55.5%), Argentina (70.6%, 43.5%), Columbia (69.3%, 51.4%), Brazil (69.2%, 35.8%), Mexico (67.2%, 47.4%), and Peru (62.6%, 33.5%)", "Regarding health, changing preferences and expectations play a large part in adoption of mHealth services, as well as sub populations’ differential access to smartphone technology and its infrastructure.", "Knowledge of likely access can be important. For example, an estimated 88% of American teens between the ages of 13 and 17 years have access to mobile phones and 73% own a smartphone [79], but this age group has different behavioral risk patterns than older populations regarding human immunodeficiency virus infection behavior.", "Such differences impact intervention design approaches and what can be supported by the target population and technology platform", "[80]. The number of “Millennials” (ie, ages 18 to 34 years) in the United States will increase to over 75 million and outnumber every other generational category in 2015", "[81]. The 2015 State of the Connected Patient [82], reported that 40% of Millennials did not believe their primary care physician “would recognize them if they passed each other on the street” and 60% of Millennials preferred a video chat with their physician in place of an in-office visit.", "Among US teens aged 13-18 years, the Internet is the primary source of health information with 84% obtaining health information from the Internet and one in three teens have changed their behavior based on that Web-based health information [83].", "Such information search capability requires Internet access (Core Characteristic 3).", "Mobile connectivity can be much more than a social convenience. Consider Africa, which has the lowest Network Readiness Index as defined by the World Economic Forum [84].", "The growth in basic mobile-based access affords simple messaging, which reduces the need for face-to-face medical visits, thus reducing health care costs due to reduced transportation needs and reduced diagnostic or referral delays for controlling Malaria outbreaks, especially in rural areas [85,86].", "In Africa, South America, and Asia, there is a disproportionate number of poor people who lack direct access to the financial infrastructure—the “unbanked.”", "Consequently, mobile access gives access to information and services, such as sending and receiving payments, allowing them to directly participate in, and gain from, a developing economy [76,84].", "Relatedly, it is estimated that “75% of the world’s poor rely on agriculture for all or some of their household income,” so even simple (SMS-based) text messaging allows informational exchange with specialists to increase agricultural productivity and, consequently, income [87].", "Although the costs of owning smartphone technology are decreasing, and, perhaps as a consequence, ownership of mobile phones is increasing, the penetration and adoption of this technology is not uniform.", "It is essential to know the adoption patterns of the target population for the technological platform itself.", "The second characteristic of smartphone technology is the availability of apps installable on the device.", "At its heart, we noted a “smartphone” is basically a computer with radio communications capabilities.", "Thus, smartphones have the functions and capabilities of a general purpose computer platform, enabling third-party developers to build and run their own programs (“apps”) exploiting the functionality of the particular device.", "Apps must be built specifically for the device’s OS (ie, Apple iOS, Android, Windows, Blackberry, Symbian).", "The software driving smartphones is the OS. Note that iOS is unique to Apple, Blackberry OS is unique to Blackberry, but several phone manufacturers use Android OS (eg, Google, Samsung, HTC, LG, Motorola, and now Nokia) and Microsoft Windows Phone OS (eg, Samsung, Nokia, HTC, Huawei).", "Symbian OS and its primary supporter Nokia dominated the mobile phone market from early 2000s to 2010 though it is now on a substantial downward trend", "[88]. Given the Android open source software availability [89] and Android “remerging” into the Linux open source project [90], other Linux-Android OS phones are emerging with uniquely branded OSs, such as the Ubuntu phone [91].", "As noted, Samsung is also developing phones and devices that use the open source Linux Tizen OS [92].", "Furthermore, apps can be constructed to interact (acquire data and drive functionality) with connected devices, wired or wireless.", "As smartphones comprise a more expensive, but more capable, subset of the general mobile phone devices, the penetration levels are comparatively lower than smartphones, but as we noted earlier they are rapidly increasing due to relative price declines.", "In December 2015, US estimates indicated smartphones were owned by 79.3% of mobile subscribers, with Android phones holding 53.3% of the market, Apple iOS with 42.9%, Microsoft with 2.9%, and BlackBerry with 0.9% [93].", "Worldwide second quarter estimates place Android comfortably in the lead with 82.8% of smartphone OS, Apple with 13.9%, Windows with 2.6%, and BlackBerry with 0.3% [94].", "There are a remarkably large and growing number of general apps available under the 2 dominant platforms—Apple (1.5 million) and Android (1.6 million)—as of July, 2015 [95].", "Although the market share for the Windows phone is dominated by Android and iOS, the use of apps may be more fluid as Microsoft is targeting the development of apps for both Android and iOS devices", "[96] as well as providing technological support (via software development kits) to port iOS and Android apps to Windows [97].", "From a health care perspective, smartphone apps reside within increasingly powerful (mobile, hand-held) hardware-software environments, allowing sophisticated data acquisition, communication, and computation-intensive processes to be done locally, such as various types of numerical and non-numerical calculations, data analytics, display graphics, and video, along with megabytes to gigabytes of local data storage.", "For example, the growth of mobile phone capabilities can bring important analytics to drive treatment decisions in outbreaks in rural or underserved populations, such as the use of a microscope app that analyzes videos of whole blood samples for microfilarial parasite L loa motion, quantifying density for determination of treatment within 2 minutes [98].", "Similar mobile phone apps are in design, development, or production for in vitro and environmental testing directly (or indirectly with attached ancillary devices) supporting onsite detection of pathogens, such as disease markers via nucleic acid isolation, gold nanoprobe Tuberculosis diagnostics, microchip ELISA detection of ovarian cancer via HE4 biomarker and other cancer cell diagnostics, fluorescent imaging cytometry, lateral flow immunochromatographic assays, loop-mediated isothermal amplification genetic testing, and acoustic wave immunoassay to name a few [99].", "Thus, even in resource-poor environments, mobile phone apps in the hands of health care workers can bring critically needed point of care or point of need analytics previously unavailable to underserved populations.", "The nature of this reach is enhanced by the sophistication of the apps that can be run on the mobile devices given their computational capabilities, and these computational capabilities are escalating.", "Estimates suggest that the Apple iPhone 6’s A8 chip is 50x faster than the chip in the original iPhone and its graphics processing unit is 84x faster [100], but the Apple iPhone 6s’s A9 SoC (System on Chip) has an estimated 50% increase in processing performance and a 90% increase in graphics performance over the A8", "[101]. The ARM Mali-T760 MP8 graphics processing unit in the Samsung Galaxy S6 can generate a peak performance of 302 Gflops [102], roughly equivalent to the supercomputers in 1996 [103], whereas IBM’s Deep Blue supercomputer, which bettered the world chess champion Gary Kasparov in 1997, has an estimated performance of 11.4 Gflops and was the 259th fastest supercomputer in 1997 [104], emphasizing how the technological capability is used, the critical role of programming.", "For these devices, ancillary storage and speed of types of secure digital (SD) cards, the typical detachable storage medium, is also expanding along with the transfer speed.", "The size of the card is contracting, with the cost per storage unit decreasing as the next wave of improvements enter the market.", "In 2003, SD had a capacity of 512 megabytes, but disk capacity has increased 1000-fold, where SanDisk’s 512 gigabyte SD cards are temperature tolerant (−13° to 185°F), waterproof, shockproof, and x-rayproof [105].", "This capacity means the card approximates the size of a postage stamp, any given mobile phone could have direct access to over 458 million pages of text (1200 characters per page) or a complete copy (snapshot) of all Wikipedia including images, for offline access [106] with space left over for either 128,000 average size ePub formatted books (3 Mbytes) or over 4500 five-minute YouTube videos at 720p.", "Thus, the information “at your fingertips” can be rather large.

The possibility of personalization of public health, real-time data acquisition, and a host of other possibilities relevant to assessing, monitoring, and reacting to individualized contexts are just beginning.", "Issues of data privacy, HIPAA defined risk, app functionality risk and validity, and beyond are rapidly rising to the top of development agendas [107].", "Most of the legal barriers, because of technology available when they were written, are oriented toward the electronic protection and privacy of patient information held in health care databases.", "Yang and Silverman [108] warn that when software is voluntarily downloaded and installed (as an app), accessing data from that app about the user may not be considered “unauthorized” as it is sometimes wrongly assumed under the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act of 1986.", "In fact, they even conclude the Electronic Communications Privacy Act “probably does not protect against the access or acquisition of data by the developer of a private app” (p. 224).", "Most users (and uses) do not demand high computational performance of mobile phones, but it is likely that this demand will escalate with the user-facing capabilities of the health-related apps.", "Consequently, types of health services that can be offered via these platforms are increasing in number and sophistication.", "Referring again to the 2015 State of the Connected Patient report [82]: 63% of Millennials would be interested proactively providing their health data from Wi-Fi or wearable devices to their doctor or provider so they can monitor their well-being and 71% would be interested in a doctor giving them a mobile app to actively manage their well-being for preventative care.", "Such interests require demands going beyond simple local data capture and reporting (eg, “fitness” apps), but more sophisticated data acquisition and processing coupled with sufficient analytical and communication capabilities.", "Finally, it is worth noting that an IMS Institute reports that despite the 100,000+ of health apps, just 36 apps accounted for almost 50% of the downloads (ignoring use), and 40% of the apps had less than 5000 downloads [109].", "The third characteristic of mobile phone technology is the ability to access the Internet or World Wide Web via mobile broadband.", "It is not sufficient that devices are portable, powerful, and capable to run the appropriate apps, but it is often the case that they must also be able to communicate via rapid Internet pathways.", "The technological sophistication or maturity of a region (defining its capabilities) is determined by the particular mix of its mobile technologies [110].", "Note that the term “wireless broadband” should generally not be used in place of “mobile broadband” (or mobile cellular broadband) as wireless broadband can include fixed-wireless and satellite technologies, although some satellite broadband technologies can be mobile.", "The ITU generally defines mobile broadband as download data speeds of at least 256 Kbit/s using the Internet protocol and access to the “greater Internet” (ie, World Wide Web) via the Hypertext Transfer Protocol, but solely having standard short messaging service (SMS) does not count as broadband as it is a mobile-based voice protocol and does not require Internet access", "[111]. Mobile broadband is also defined in terms of technological generations (G), where 2G, 2.5G, 2.75G (1990s) technologies were the first digital cellular networks with speeds in the ITU range just noted and represents an earlier 2011 definition yielding 90% world coverage [112].", "As with any evolving technology, definitions must change as the categorical characteristics of the technology change [113,114], so it is important to understand the operating definition of mobile broadband being used, and whether the reported statistics refer to overall capacity (eg, gigabit levels attributed to 802.11ac) or actual expected delivery rates for individuals under operational conditions and distance.", "In particular, many definitions specify or assume at least 3G technologies [115], with Long Term Evolution and Long Term Evolution-Advanced being the current fastest widely deployed mobile broadband technologies in terms of overall capacities and the closest to becoming the global base standard (there are different deployment forms) for mobile broadband [116].", "In addition, intermediate steps taking advantage of current standards have yielded niche standards such as WiGig (802.11ad), which is a very fast (7 gigabits per sec, low latency), but short range (1-7 m) designed for close connectivity, such as eliminating cables [117].", "On the other hand, the forthcoming next-generation 802.11ax wireless specification is not only seeking increases in network capacity but also seeking to create larger “data pipes” to individual devices, thus radically increasing not only the network capacity but also the average data rates to individual devices [118].", "When considering newer baseline definition of mobile broadband subscriptions (at least 3G networks), the ITU of the United Nations estimates that 47.2 per 100 inhabitants of the world’s population is to be subscribed in 2015, with 89% of the world urban population (4 billion) covered but only 29% of the rural population (3.4 billion) covered, but substantial distributional differences between the developed countries (86.7 per 100 inhabitants), developing countries (39.2 per 100 inhabitants), and the least developed countries (12.1 per 100 inhabitants), where Africa is the sole region where mobile broadband is below 20 per 100 inhabitants (though within-regional differences occur)", "[115]. However, comparisons are complex as there is still a great deal of variation in how “mobile broadband” is defined, how specific technologies are classified, and how measurements are conducted [119].", "Regardless, Ericsson predicts that by 2021, 85% of all smartphone subscriptions will be for mobile broadband, but whether it plays a replacement role for fixed broadband or a complementary role depends on the particular segment [74].", "It is important to understand how these characteristics map to target populations. For example, there are distinct issues with the lack of rural broadband (wired or wireless or mobile) in the United States, where 53% of rural Americans (22 million people) lack such access, as do almost two-third of US territories and Tribal lands [120].", "A 2015 Pew survey found that 54% of sampled African American homes had broadband, a decline from 2013, and this percent varied by household income, ranging from a low of 41% (income < $29K) to a high of 80% ($50K ≤ income ≤ $75K) [121].", "The same survey showed that almost 20% of African American households have smartphones, but no broadband.", "There is an emerging trend of smartphone dependence among younger adults, nonwhites, lower income, and lower educational attainment, where these devices are the sole mechanism for both Web-based access (often at slow speeds) and phone calls (elimination of land lines) for communication, but also are less likely to be covered by health insurance or have a bank account [122].", "The decline of landlines in the United States was further evidenced by a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention survey that estimated 47.1% of children and 39.1% of adults live in wireless-only households, with 56.2% of poor households and 53.1% of Hispanic households were wireless-only [72].", "Two consequences of decline in landline use, sometimes overlooked, are (1) the loss of community revenue typically accrued by local telecommunication taxes, as federal law prohibits state and local taxation of Internet data, including communication apps such as Skype, FaceTime, WhatsApp, and Twitter", "[123] and (2) potential bias in “phone-based” surveys reliant on landline registers [72,124].", "The penetration of mobile broadband worldwide is expected to surpass fixed-broadband by 2017 [125]. In fact, the 34 member countries of the Organization for Cooperation and Economic Development now report an average of 81.3% mobile broadband penetration (wireless subscriptions per inhabitant), with 7 members averaging above the 100% mark [126].", "Collectively the Organization for Cooperation and Economic Development member countries’ population is approximately 1 billion people, and the results necessarily do not include data from other important regions, as Africa, India, Brazil, China, and Russia.", "For example, in the least developed countries, fixed-broadband remains less than 1% and escalation to mobile broadband is the sole option [115].", "Regarding health care, mobile broadband is essential for accessing the Internet resources and supporting the sufficient bandwidth for communication capabilities of data-intensive mobile phone app, such as video, without the need for, or reliance on, geospecific landlines.", "For example, the Mobile MIM iOS app allowing viewing X-rays, ultrasounds, neuroimaging on iPads, or iPhones by medical professionals, but developers also provide VueMe iOS apps for secure patients to view and discuss images with their health providers without physical presence required [127].", "Despite the increasing capabilities of mobile phones, attached devices offer another route to point-of-care accessibility via mobile technology, allowing local complex data acquisition (via the combined capability of the attached device and the mobile phone) by a health care professional.", "The MobiUS SP1 mobile phone app interacts with a hand-held ultrasound device, allowing local scanning and transfer of imaging via Wi-Fi, cellular or USB to PC connection [128].", "Dexcom’s Apple Watch app displays patterns of glucose readings. It receives data from Dexcom’s Continuous Glucose Monitoring system that captures glucose levels by a subcutaneous sensor, up to 288 readings per day, and relaying the information (and any warnings) to up to five additional “followers” [129].", "The AliveECG app (with the attached device) allows individuals to take their own ECG with their Android or iOS smartphone (or tablet), which then analyzes the data to determine if atrial fibrillation (a leading cause of stroke) is detected [130].", "Proteus Digital Health has both an ingestible sensor-enabled pill that works with an external patch that detects a signal that is generated from the pill when ingested (reaches the stomach) and records rest or activity patterns (steps, heart rate) that are sent via Bluetooth to the caregiver’s, patient’s, or physician’s mobile phone app, as well as to a secure database accessible by authorized health care professionals [131].", "Propeller Health’s sensor attaches to most asthma and COPD inhalers, capturing time and geolocation data of use (and other data, such as user-supplied medications), linking to an app that can share that data with health care partners or anonymously (eg, capturing timing and location data across users signaling environmental situations), but the app also provides information on adherence and education [132].", "Medronic’s MiniMed system connects its small insulin pump and continuous glucose monitor to a diabetics iPhone, sending pump and sensor information to the iPhone every 5 minutes, and sending history information to their CareLink health care “partners” every 24 hours, or preset text messages immediately if glucose levels exceed tolerance levels [133].", "In addition, Medtronic is also partnering with Samsung to develop Android apps for that device series [134].", "All of the previously noted devices are examples that have been approved, or are being reviewed for approval, by the US Food and Drug Administration at the time of this writing, which speaks to the separate topic of how smartphone technology (directly or indirectly) takes on the role of a regulated medical device [135].", "But Internet connectivity is an ever-emerging architecture. Every smartphone can act as a wireless hotspot affording a gateway for other smartphones or computers or attached devices.", "To complicate things, Bluetooth 4.2 allows devices to securely connect to each other and to the Internet via IPv6/6LoWPAN (IPv6 over Low-Power Wireless Personal Area Networks) via direct connection to any gateway device (eg, a router) and avoid the necessity of a smartphone entirely, thus opening the communication door for the “Internet of Things”—sensors, instruments, devices, and attachments that have the capability of interacting directly with the Internet", "The final characteristic of mobile phone technology is that mobile phones are usually tethered to individuals, though the validity of this characteristic is dependent on the heterogeneity of the penetration of this technology in certain populations.", "With respect to penetration, consider that mobile phone technology differs critically from landlines on this metric because mobile phones are associated with individuals and not residences (requiring a permanent, physical location), so there is usually a 1:1 mapping between individuals and mobile phone use (but this mapping can also be 1:N, when individual users have more than one mobile phone account per SIM card).", "In addition, a US Gallup Panel in July 2015 revealed that on the average 11% checked their mobile phone devices every few minutes (22% of those between the ages of 18 and 29 years), and an addition average of 41% reported checking a few times an hour (51% of those between the ages of 18-29)", "[137]. Nevertheless, the assumption of individual tethering is likely a valid default assumption sans conflicting evidence.", "At a basic level, this affords an efficient technological mechanism for 2 health purposes: data monitoring-acquisition and intervention delivery.", "Regarding the former, individual tethering allows “immediate” acquisition of personal event data, actively or passively.", "For example, various types of experience sampling or ecological momentary assessment methods have emerged to capture individuals’ self-reporting episodic descriptions (event based, time based) of behaviors and experiences in “real time” (ie, to avoid delayed, retrospective autobiographic approaches that may be biased in recall or inaccurately reported) in real-world contexts, such as diaries (paper or electronic), telephone calls, generally emerging in the 1990s", "[138-140]. Mobile phones are now serving as a natural platform for applying such data acquisition approaches for conditions as tobacco use [141], alcohol use [142], development of virtues [143], mood and affect assessment", "[144], diet and physical activity [145], and obesity-specific contexts [146], with additional activity sensor capabilities that serve to augment “message-based” data for such approaches [147].", "Individual tethering accordingly supports personalized medicine or public health interventions as allowing for specific messages to be sent to specific individuals.", "In general, individually-tailored messages in public health interventions are more likely (when properly designed) to effect behavior change than generic messages [148].", "Although the particular definition of “tailoring” in public health and health care has varied widely [149,150], our interpretation simply addresses the fundamental characteristic of what the technology can deliver—connectivity tethered to an individual.", "How any form of tailoring will be used (and its likely impact will be) exploiting that characteristic depends on the quality of the design in the context of an intervention.", "For example, linking an ecological momentary assessment method with an intervention treatment to support individually-tailored SMS connectivity [151], but use of other forms of tailoring exploiting the tethered nature of mobile phones are being developed, such as with human immunodeficiency virus adherence [152], but is a growing component of many SMS intervention designs [153].", "Again, the tethered technology affords various types of tailoring, but the impact of any tailoring depends on the quality of the design and its implementation.", "Of course, the 1:1 mapping also allows for large amounts of (and of potentially high fidelity) patient-generated health data, aggregated for location and time-dependent analyses at a group level, such as disease surveillance or clinical practice statistics [154,155].", "A question regarding tethering involves not only the generation of individual’s data but also one of access to individual’s EHR.", "A survey by Accenture [156] demonstrates how both physicians’ and health consumers’ attitudes and behaviors regarding digital technology and health have changed in 2 years, for example, in patient’s actual access their electronic records (2014: 27%, 2016: 45%), in what data they have access to in their EHR (2014: 39%, 2016: 65%), and in the use of health apps (2014: 16%, 2016: 33%).", "However, the same survey revealed that 92% of patients believed that they should have full access to their EHR, whereas only 18% of physicians held that same belief.", "This is one example of gaps that may exist between 2 of the key stakeholders with respect to use of this technology: patients and their health care providers.", "Characteristic Interactions and Their Consequences", "Of course, the world is often more complex and dynamic than we either describe or anticipate. Collectively, interactions and secondary impacts of these characteristics are beginning to emerge.", "For example, the problem of individuals’ “access to access” (ie, availability of technology that enables access to health services) is evaporating.", "As the penetration of smartphone into all populations continues, it affords an important vehicle for recruitment of under-represented groups in clinical trials and other health-related research [157].", "But as technology forms become more effective and efficient, so do mHealth offerings, and this usually results in differential access (eg, via cost) to the “best” mHealth solutions [158].", "Mobile phone–based apps allow the localization of data acquisition, processing, and presentation or response options to specific individuals, situations, and context.", "Access to the Internet or World Wide Web increases the amount and forms of data gathered and transmitted to and from individuals and groups, over time and across place.", "Consequently, mHealth for health care has generated many variations of technological use, ranging from the ability to generate tailored messages to individuals or to groups of individuals with similar needs via the Web [159] or via text messages [160], to engaging technological combinations such as those being designed in broad, social media systems [161] affording “peer-to-peer” health care [162] or to realizing new health surveillance capabilities through extant technology and relevant populations, such as “participatory epidemiology” forms of engagement and rapid communication [163-165].", "The rise of inter-connectivity of local health-rated devices will not only increase the potential of mHealth but also increase the complexity of its design.", "The nature of “wearable” health devices are currently worn either on the wrist (55%) or the chest (27%) or the purse or pocket or shoe (17%), but are also appearing on the arm (8%), head (7%) clothing (6%) leg or ear (5%), ankle (3%), necklace (3%), or finger (1%)", "[109] and are highly dependent on sensors [166].

Given the opportunities for engaging mHealth apps for public health, it is necessary to understand the broad array of interconnection forces at play, now and likely in the future.", "This is a distinctly different patient-facing functionality than the failed Google Health’s medical records or health data platform [172] offering various forms of disintermediating from “traditional” health care reimbursement, face-to-face models, but it is difficult to predict how the insurance industry or federal or state regulators will respond.", "What is clear is that the upcoming Stage 3 requirement of the Meaningful Use incentive program from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services strongly encourages patient engagement (care management, wellness, and patient supplied data) outside of a clinic using mobile health apps, coordination of care, and patient access to health information via mobile platforms [173].", "Recall that Apple’s HealthKit integrates with the Epic System’s EHR system. Consider that one of the primary reasons for HealthKit’s growing adoption in health systems is the fundamental simplicity of connecting to institutional EHR systems [174], and the top EHR vendor meeting the Meaningful Use requirement is Epic [175].", "Note also that Duke Medicine recently succeeded in being the first Epic-based health system to implement the Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources standard with Apple’s HealthKit", "[176], a standard that also allows Epic Systems EHR data to interoperate with IBM’s Watson Health analytics [177].", "Overall, the adoption of even basic EHR by the key gatekeepers, the physicians, is occluded by the encountered difficulties of data exchange, whether it involves interoperability standards or strategic moves by vendors to gain competitive advantage [178].", "Nevertheless, specific inroads work to demonstrate ways of overcoming such obstacles for specific health objectives on mobile apps [179-181].", "mHealth is an ill-defined, but growing component of all aspects of health (prevention, diagnosis, treatment, research) around the world.", "We focused on 4 core characteristics of the foundational platform, the mobile smartphone, that will likely remain as important to understand to help design and implement more effective and efficient mHealth solutions.", "More importantly, as each characteristic has surprising depth, complexity, and relation to the other characteristics, it is essential to discern how these work together in any particular mHealth context.", "Each type of characteristic embodies both features and constraints.", "This is the fastest spreading communication technology. The first core characteristic—penetration into populations—is possible because mobile telephony is becoming ubiquitous, and this has significant implications for reach into populations, although not homogenously in many cases.", "Therefore, is necessary to know the technological platform most adopted and how it is used by the target population or subgroup.", "Apps are powerful but issues of use are complicated. The second core characteristic—the availability of app — affords potentially sophisticated function (and computation) available to the device, depending on the type of mobile phone.", "In addition, the growth of short-range device connectivity allows ancillary devices to be connected to the mobile phone, enlarging the set of technological options in communication, monitoring, and delivery of health solutions.", "In addition, both the sophistication of sensors on, or connected to, a mobile phone raises the question of whether it is (they are) a medical device (in a legal sense) and how HIPAA rules guide the storage and use of that data.", "Given the immense growth in apps, competition can be intense, but opportunities for innovation are practically unbounded.", "Connectivity matters. The third characteristic—wireless broadband—is the most rapidly growing technological platform for Internet access, so consideration of mHealth contexts with Internet connectivity, even intermittent connectivity, affords a substantially different pathway for expected data rates to and from devices, influencing the formation and functionality of mHealth apps and their target groups.", "However, as lower income groups increase their (often sole) reliance on mobile broadband for Internet connectivity, data charges can escalate rapidly.", "Costs to the client are still a part of the use equation.", "Almost everybody has a mobile phone. The fourth characteristic—that mobile phones are generally tethered to individuals—affords direct access to individuals allowing deep penetration to the individual level, with apps being tailored to individuals and having the ability to adapt to individual behaviors and physiological data, captured and communicated distally (if necessary) in real time.", "The primary interpretation of the 4 characteristics is that they serve as both opportunities and constraints.", "However, to exploit them as either, it is essential to understand what they are, and how they relate to one’s specific mHealth context.", "Regardless, they are the enduring characteristics common to all mHealth mobile phone apps.", "Recently Gordon Moore (the architect of Moore’s Law) stated, We’ve just seen the beginning of what computers are going to do for us [182].", "The ubiquity of the devices, their computational ability, and their ability to capture and rapidly transmit complex data, whether the data comes from “medical devices (Food and Drug Administration approved) or not, the rate and amount of data captured lends itself to large-scale analytics affording new, broader capabilities” [183] which, of course, can be used for “good or evil” [184].", "Along with “Big Data” often comes “Big Noise,” so the merging of technology and health contexts will allow us the opportunity to move from collecting data, which has a cost (eg, acquisition, storage, transfer, security, integrity), to efficiently extracting information, which as a value by guiding decisions that lead to health improvements in individuals, groups, and societies.", "The key is achieving the economically-viable potential to turn acquired data into information that can be applied to the betterment of health, which necessitates not only well-designed interventions but also well-designed evaluations of those interventions [185].", "Yet, there is likely another level where health care, and public health, use that information to inform policies that are enabled, and not blocked, by institutional mechanisms.", "Still the fundamental mantra remains: mHealth is not about technology; it is about how technology is appropriately used in the context of achieving specific health goals [186,187].", "Nevertheless, future discussions must include additional considerations of how to weave the use and usability of such technology into the foundational designs of interventions, and not simply a delivery platform afterthought, as technology is not neutral.", "Translating evidence-based interventions for one mode in which it was designed (eg, workshops) cannot be adopted for another mode without determining the impact on the integrity of the original logic [188,189].", "Mobile phone and communication technologies afford us characteristics with remarkable capabilities and potential.", "And these are rapidly, unpredictably, and even disruptively, changing and changing health care and public health.", "This work was funded in part by a grant from Emory University’s Global Health Institute and the Goizueta Business School Summer Research Fund at Emory University.", "Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act", "- 1.WHO.

Their technology, the G5, works with a small sensor placed on the skin which monitors levels which are then transmitted to a mobile device like a smart phone.", "This technology still requires a finger prick calibration every 12 hours, but delivers continuous data to your phone without scanning, or having to finger prick in between.", "Dexcom have even partnered with the Apple Watch so uses can discreetly view their glucose reading, trend arrow, and trend graph at a glance of their wrist!", "The app is also compatible with Android Wear Watches too.", "Dexcom's sleek G5 design with examples of connectivity.", "Next up, a competitor of Dexcom’s is Abbot’s Freestyle Libre system. Marketed as a potentially cheaper alternative to the Dexcom product, Freestyle Libre incorporates Flash monitoring, which eliminates the need to finger prick.", "Instead, the patient wears a disposable patch which can be checked by scanning the device over the patch at regular intervals.", "Abbot's FDA/CE approved Freestyle Libre system and what's in the box!", "Finger prick testing is still required if the app tells you to, or your symptoms don’t match readings, but both of these competitors dramatically reduce the frequency of finger pricks.", "Bigfoot Biomedical are another name I’ve come across recently, who have a great backstory on their site.", "According to the ‘Legend’ found on their website, a few years ago the five year old son of a wall street banker, Bryan Mazlish, was diagnosed with Type 1 diabetes.", "Rather than just accept the treatment options available on the market, Bryan decided to hack into an off the-shelf insulin pump and an early iteration of the Dexcom system, before merging the two together with a mobile app which effectively creates an automated insulin delivery system.", "What Bigfoot Biomedical's product could look like!", "You can read the full story here, and the fully commercialised system is nearing the market, after Bigfoot recruited some big names including former JDRF CEO Jeffrey Brewer and former Medtronic Chief Engineer Lane Desborough.", "Next up is an automated insulin pump from Cellnovo which is a mobile diabetes management system. This one handles the actual distribution of insulin, as opposed to just the monitoring of glucose levels.", "The Cellnovo solution, includes an insulin pump, cellular-enabled wireless touchscreen handset and an integrated blood glucose meter.", "Their claim is to be the first mobile diabetes management system, as their subtle insulin pump which is attached to the skin is an alternative to the painful insulin injections Type 1 diabetes patients have to otherwise endure.", "Getting ever more futuristic, Senseonics have come up with an implantable monitoring system, which stays under the skin.", "Whereas the Dexcom and Freestyle Libre systems both have disposable elements the Eversense will continually measures glucose levels for the operating life of the sensor (approximately 90 days).", "After the sensor has been inserted, the system includes a smart transmitter which fits over the top and gives on-body vibrating alerts when glucose levels are low or high.", "All these solutions have the potential to help improve patients’ quality of lives dramatically, but as yet we haven’t seen one comprehensive solution for glucose monitoring and management, which is why we’re currently seeing a swathe of partnerships across the industry.", "Two of the businesses we’ve already mentioned, Bigfoot and Freestyle Libre announced their formal partnership earlier this year, and Dexcom have also looked to create partnerships with various different pump manufacturers.", "One of the most notable of these is Tandem, a manufacturer of small pumps which Dexcom hope will enable them to create a comprehensive full diabetes management system.", "Those are just a selection of companies I come across regularly from working within the diabetes space, but the future looks even brighter, with some frankly astounding technologies currently in development.", "Pills with hidden insulin-injecting needles are one idea touted in this article from Diabetes Forecast, and ‘smart’ insulin is currently in Phase 1 trials with pharma giant, Merck, which automatically goes into action when glucose is too high, and then deactivates when glucose is back down to a stable level.", "The diabetes market is a great place to be at the moment – every month we’re seeing new phases of testing and FDA/CE approvals which have the opportunity to shake up the market dramatically, and the innovation taking place has potentially fantastic implications for patients and businesses alike.", "I’d be really interested to know who you think could shake up the market next year.

The correct placement of the blood drop on the test strip requires thorough training and is not equally possible with all BGM systems.", "Given the amount of effort necessary and the cost of the test strip, this procedure needs to give a high rate of success; that is, as far as possible every measurement made should lead to a valid device reading.", "In this respect it is important that the test strips are not too flexible—they should be stiff enough so that they can be guided, starting from the metacarpophalangeal joint, along the fingers to the hanging drop of blood (haptic feedback).", "Some devices start glucose measurement even if insufficient blood is taken, leading to incorrect readings.", "| • Easy gathering of all materials needed for the measurement |", "| • These materials need to be placed so that they are quickly identifiable by touch when needed |", "| • One must be able to pick up a test strip easily from the box |", "| • The test strip needs to be inserted in the correct orientation into the corresponding slot on the meter |", "| • A skin prick has to be applied so that a sufficiently large drop of blood is formed for the BGM |", "| • The “hanging” drops of blood have to be applied at the right location on the test strip and in a sufficient amount so that the measurement can be started |", "| • The patient should not contaminate themselves (eg, clothing) or the surrounding environment with blood |", "| • Patients must be able to read the result (when they are only slightly visual impaired) or the result is indicated by acoustic signals (see below) |", "| • The result needs to be interpreted so that the appropriate conclusions for acute adjustments in therapy can be drawn |", "| • The measured values must be documented in a suitable form |", "Another major problem is being able to “read” the measurement results.

A current trend in the development of new products for diabetes treatment is the integration of mobile- and Internet-based solutions.", "Thus, from the BGM readings and other therapeutic data a clear picture of the glucose profile of a given patient over time can be obtained which provides the basis for an individually optimized diabetes treatment.", "Why Are Most Medical Products Not Being Designed to Be Barrier-Free?", "From the point of view of the manufacturer, the development and approval of barrier-free medical products is associated with additional costs and risks of product liability; in particular this last point represents a problem for the manufacturers.", "As long as there is no legal obligation to supply barrier-free devices, nothing will change in the future on this front, in spite of the fact that 160 countries worldwide have ratified the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities.", "The countries which signed the convention committed to the following, stated in Article 9—Accessibility, “To enable persons with disabilities to live independently and participate fully in all aspects of life, States Parties shall take appropriate measures to ensure to persons with disabilities access, on an equal basis with others, to the physical environment, to transportation, to information and communications, including information and communications technologies and systems, and to other facilities and services open or provided to the public, both in urban and in rural areas.”", "In addition it is stated in Article 25—Health, “In particular, States Parties shall: a.

But it costs a fortune and requires years to get a project producing.", "This brings us to Transocean (RIG, $2.44), a leading offshore driller.", "Transocean specializes in ultra-deepwater drilling.

The energy sector is hurting, and leveraged players such as Chesapeake are hurting the worst.", "Chesapeake's survival as a publicly traded company is in jeopardy. If nothing else, CHK won't meet the requirements to stay listed on the New York Stock Exchange if it doesn't do a reverse stock split – the NYSE requires that its listed stocks maintain a share price of at least a dollar.", "But the problems go beyond delisting. Chesapeake avoided bankruptcy in 2019 by renegotiating terms with creditors and issued a \"going concern\" warning in its third quarter earnings call.", "To the uninitiated, this warning is a statement by the company that its very existence is in question.", "A stock as cheap as CHK could be considered a nice lottery ticket.

Even more importantly, it has learned from its mistakes.", "The company was coming off of a bad run in 2009, and management decided changes needed to be made. Domino's changed up their recipes, issued a major mea culpa in their advertising and came back stronger than ever.", "DPZ probably won't deliver another 5,771% run over the next 11 years.

Netflix created streaming video as we know it today, transformed programming to an on-demand model and made binge-watching TV shows normal.", "Prior to disrupting television, Netflix essentially killed the traditional movie rental business with its DVD-by-mail model.", "Rather than having to schlep to the nearest Blockbuster, movie watchers could pre-order DVDs, have them delivered to their homes and then return them in pre-addressed envelopes when convenient.", "It seems almost quaint now, but it was revolutionary in the early 2000s.", "It remains to be seen whether Netflix has a third act, but it seems to be doing just fine on its current business model.", "Netflix has new competitive threats that it didn't have back in 2009. Amazon.com (AMZN) started its first streaming service in 2006, but it took a few years to get traction.", "And now Disney (DIS) has entered the fray with Disney+. Furthermore, content costs aren't getting any cheaper, and Netflix is frequently getting into bidding wars with rival streamers.", "And all of this is happening as new subscriber growth is starting to level off in the United States.", "All the same, don't count Netflix out in the long term. It has become a staple in millions of homes, and its expansion into international markets is still in the early stages.", "The destruction of the banking sector in 2008 and the tighter regulation that followed created an opening for nimble fintech companies to muscle into the market.", "And that's exactly how LendingTree (TREE, $283.12) managed to return 7,104.1% over the past 11 years.", "LendingTree is not a bank or mortgage lender, but rather a marketplace. It is a third-party service that submits your loan request to multiple bankers and brokers within its network.", "These companies then compete to get you the lowest price.", "And it's not just mortgages. LendingTree allows you to find the best deals on auto loans, credit cards, insurance and more.", "As the millennials, the most tech-savvy generation in history, finally start to settle down and buy homes, LendingTree should continue to see healthy revenue growth.", "OK, 7,000%-plus returns might be stretching it, but it's worth noting that LendingTree is still growing its revenues at a 26% annual rate.", "The past 11 years have been a lucrative time to be in the business of fighting diabetes. We've already covered Insulet Corporation and its OmniPod solution.", "Now, let's take a look at Dexcom (DXCM, $286.56), one of the best stocks of the past decade-plus.", "Like Insulet, Dexcom helps diabetes patients manage their blood sugar, specializing in continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) systems.", "Dexcom makes wearable sensor that transmits your glucose numbers to your iPhone, Apple Watch or Android device.", "Business has certainly been good. Since the March 2009 market bottom, Dexcom has returned 8,182.1%.

The stock's valuation is well into nosebleed territory with a price-to-earnings ratio of nearly 250 and a price-to-sales ratio of 17.", "Dexcom is growing its revenues at a 37% annualized clip, so it's easy to see why they find it worthwhile to pay a premium.", "But at current prices, you can't help but wonder if all the good news is more than priced in.", "No one wants to experience a colonoscopy. It is a universally hated medical procedure, and the discomfort associated with it no doubt discourages a lot of patients from having one done.", "That's unfortunate, because a lack of proper screening allows potentially deadly colon and rectal cancers to go undetected.", "This is where Exact Sciences (EXAS, $65.58) rides in to the rescue.

Remarkably, Exact Sciences' spectacular returns come in spite of the stock losing nearly half its value over the past eight months.", "In its last quarterly earnings release, Exact Sciences reported a more-than-doubling of its revenues year-over-year.", "Yet the company isn't profitable and isn't expected to be profitable next year either. So, for all the company's promise, EXAS still must be considered highly speculative.", "Making semiconductors requires a high degree of precision, as even a speck of dust can wreak havoc on the manufacturing process.", "Well, this is exactly where Entegris (ENTG, $52.60) excels. The company develops micro contamination-control products to semiconductor makers and other high-tech industries such as flat-panel display manufacturers.", "Business has certainly been good. Entegris' stock price is up an incredible 9,128.1% over the past 11 years.", "Semiconductors are a notoriously cyclical industry, so it's entirely possible that Entergris will have a few rough quarters in front of it if the coronavirus scare pushes us into a recession.", "It's also worth noting that many of its customers are in Asia, where supply chains have been hit particularly hard.", "But given ENTG's strong positioning in a critical sector for the modern economy, we probably shouldn't expect the shares to stay down for long.", "Twenty years ago, it would have been considered sloppy to slog around town in your gym clothes. Today, it's considered normal and even has a trendy name: athleisure!", "Perhaps no company more epitomizes the athleisure trend than Lululemon Athletica (LULU, $218.55), which is among the three best stocks of the bull market at an incredible 9,635% return over the past 11 years.", "Lululemon made yoga pants a fashion staple even for people that may have never taken a yoga class in their lives.", "The company also has a successful men's line of athletic clothes and comfortable but work-appropriate pants and shirts.", "Despite being a $28.5 billion company, Lululemon still is growing like a weed. Overall company sales grew at a 23% clip last quarter, and revenue in the men's segment was 38%.", "Same-store sales were up 11%, but the bigger story is that online sales were up 30%.", "We have no way of knowing what fashion-conscious consumers will embrace. But it would seem that the athleisure trend still has a ways to run, and LULU is in prime position to take advantage of that trend.", "Most of the stocks on this list are far from surprising. They're hot names that have dominated the headlines for years.", "That makes Nexstar Media Group (NXST, $97.85) a curious addition. Nexstar is a television broadcaster that runs local affiliate stations for ABC, NBC, FOX, CBS, The CW and others across markets reaching 63% of all American households.", "In an era in which Netflix and other streaming services are all the rage, it seems odd to see a traditional broadcaster taking the No. 2 slot with total returns of 18,362.2%.", "This is particularly true given that paid TV is now a shrinking industry as more and more Americans \"cut the cord\" and cancel their cable package.", "Part of Nexstar's enduring resistance to this trend is the fact that its stations are local. If you want local news, sports and weather, you're not getting that on Disney+ or Netflix.", "And viewers that cut their cable subscriptions often continue to get local channels over aerial antennae.", "It's probably unreasonable to expect returns of nearly 20,000% over the next 11 years. But Nexstar has proven that old media still has some life left in it.", "And now, the moment you've been waiting for. The best performing stock in the Russell 1,000 since the 2009 market bottom is Jazz Pharmaceuticals (JAZZ, $119.74), which has generated a whopping 20,544.8% in returns.", "Biotech stocks such as Jazz are generally risky propositions. It's nearly impossible to know ahead of time which drugs will have successful clinical trials or which of a plethora of potential breakthroughs will actually pan out.", "Jazz wasn't doing particularly well 11 years ago. The company had had to reduce headcount and its future was uncertain.", "Today, the company has a portfolio of profitable drugs, including narcolepsy treatment Xyrem, cancer drug Erwinaze, and Defitelio, a drug that treats hepatic veno-occlusive disease.", "Additionally, the company has drugs in the pipeline targeting Parkinson's disease and leukemia.", "While Jazz tops this list of best stocks, substantially all of its explosive growth happened between 2009 and 2013.", "JAZZ shares have traded in a wide trading rage ever since, and today, they're actually relatively cheap at just 13 times earnings.", "Profit and prosper with the best of Kiplinger's advice on investing, taxes, retirement, personal finance and much more.", "Delivered daily.

Sending continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) data from a sensor on the body straight to a phone – no receiver required?", "Well, what seemed impossible five years ago is now available. G5 takes the same accurate G4 continuous glucose sensor, adds Bluetooth to a new on-body transmitter, and introduces a new iPhone/iPod Touch app for viewing the real-time data and getting notifications on the phone.", "The data can also be viewed on a CGM receiver alone (e.g., for those with an Android phone).", "Dexcom’s G5 is a landmark device approval for the FDA, and a sign of how tremendously far CGM and connectivity have come since Steve Jobs introduced the iPhone in 2007 (we were using the first-gen Dexcom STS!).", "But expectations have also risen markedly in that time.

While G4 had a 20+ foot range in our experience, we got more of a 5-10 foot range with G5.", "G5 cannot transmit through multiple floors of a house, while G4 generally could. The G5 phone app drops the signal more often than the receiver, but it doesn’t happen overwhelmingly often.", "The G5 transmitter is the same size as the original G4 Platinum transmitter. That is smaller than we would have guessed, given the addition of Bluetooth and the ability to pair with two devices.", "A downside to the new transmitter is a battery life of three months, down from six months for the G4 Platinum.", "The G4 transmitter generally lasted longer than six months, so perhaps G5 will too.", "We’d note that the transmitter sends data in real-time and does not save any glucose history. In other words, it cannot backfill missing data when both displays are out of range.", "For example, if you leave both the receiver and phone at home and go for a run, the data is completely lost.", "This is an issue for those limited cases when you don’t have either the phone or receiver in-range, but really want to gather the glucose data during that time (exercise is the obvious one)", "Better use of color and notifications actually show the current glucose value and trend arrow instead of a generic low or high alert.", "For those familiar with the G4 receiver, the new G5 receiver won’t feel much different. Dexcom has primarily made some user interface tweaks: (i) the background screen is now white, making it much easier to read (ii) the receiver shows colored banners across the top to indicate a low or high (instead of a colored number on a black background); (iii) high or low pop-up notifications actually show the current glucose value and trend (LOW – 77 mg/dl > ) instead of just a generic message (LOW).", "The receiver still has outstanding battery life (lasting at least a few days on a single charge), and the size is still MP3-like (great for a pocket or purse).", "The alarm settings, profiles, and volume are identical to the G4 receiver.", "Like the G5 app, there is still a lot of wasted white space on the main trend graph screen, and you cannot get statistics or pattern recognition on the receiver itself.", "On a positive note, Dexcom Clarity automatically detects a plugged in receiver (via a Mac or PC software tool), so uploading data and viewing stats takes less than one minute on a computer.", "Those using the G4 Receiver with Share can update the software to make their current receiver talk to the G5 transmitter.", "Retains the excellent G4 Platinum accuracy and reliability – an average 9% error versus laboratory blood glucose values.", "G5 uses the same G4 Platinum sensor and includes the updated Software 505 algorithm. This gives G5 an average 9% error vs. laboratory blood glucose values – for context, if your blood sugar is 100 mg/dl on average, that means G5 will be off from your real blood glucose value by ~9 mg/dl on average.", "This is the best accuracy of any CGM available (on average), though everyone experiences different results.", "Dexcom believes this accuracy approaches glucose meters; we would agree in our experience.", "Like G4, G5 asks for two calibrations per day. The most important calibrations are the first few.

Otherwise, you can download the PC and Mac compatible uploader, which sits in the background on your computer, auto-detects the receiver within seconds, and uploads the data in ~20 seconds.", "The web version of Clarity revolves around just four screens and is focused on identifying problem areas (When am I going low or high?) and keeping things approachable.", "Every screen allows for customizing the date range, though it defaults to two weeks and can’t display more than 30 days of data at a time.", "The “Overview” screen is a terrific one-page snapshot of key information – within 60 seconds you can answer, “Where am I having trouble?”", "This page shows an estimated A1c, average blood glucose, hypoglycemia risk (low, medium, high), time-in-range, calibrations per day, and any identified patterns.", "“Patterns” gives a deeper dive on the times of day when glucose was consistently above or below target, and Clarity shows the days of CGM traces that make up a particular pattern.", "The software also identifies your “best glucose day,” a nice focus on the underappreciated positive side of diabetes.", "This screen also gives “possible considerations” based on the pattern, but they are too generic to be actionable.", "The “Data” page shows a single CGM graph with error bars to indicate times of day with lots of variability.", "The use of color and the error bars makes it clear what times of day are a problem. You can also thumb through daily CGM traces, and Clarity will add “event” markers entered into G5, such as logged grams of carbs, exercise, and insulin doses.", "It’s currently not easy enough for Adam to regularly add events, but maybe future app integrations will improve this experience.", "“Compare” shows two periods of time side-by-side each other. This is useful to see the impact a particular change has had on your diabetes – e.g., eating lower carb for a week, exercising more often over two weeks.", "Dexcom does have a Clarity iPhone app, though it only allows viewing a PDF of the past two weeks of data, which will be absent unless you’ve uploaded the receiver or are using the G5 app.", "It would be nice if more Clarity functionality was available in the iPhone app, though it is not a tremendous hassle to open the website.", "The Clarity app seems ideal as an on-the-go option for appointments with a provider.", "The G5 app automatically posts data to Apple Health, allowing other diabetes apps like Glooko, Meal Memory, and One Drop to access it (probably mySugr too in the future).", "This is the idea of a diabetes “ecosystem of apps” targeted to specific needs and patient preferences.", "Imagine apps for meals, for exercise, for deeper CGM analysis, for social networking, or anything else.", "The one downside is G5 posts data to Apple Health with a three-hour delay, meaning other apps cannot offer real-time benefits.", "This delay stems from how the FDA defines historical (“retrospective”) data; perhaps it will decrease in the future.", "The best answer is to talk to Dexcom, since insurance varies by company and plan. Most US private insurance companies (e.g., United, Aetna, Humana, Anthem, Cigna) cover CGM, though requirements, co-insurance, and deductibles vary widely.", "Medicare does not cover personal CGM, but this will hopefully change. Many European countries are now paying for CGM, but again, it varies across the board.", "If you don’t have insurance, CGM is expensive, probably running a few thousand dollars per year.", "The G5 pricing model is similar to G4: an upfront price to get the starter kit, which includes the receiver, a transmitter, and four sensors.", "The G5 app is free. Ongoing costs include transmitters (up to four per year, though might be less in practice) and seven-day sensors.", "Dexcom has not disclosed what each component costs.", "We hope CGM gets less expensive over time, particularly if more patients can pay a pharmacy co-pay for sensors (similar to picking up a drug).", "Make it easier and faster to see real-time CGM values and trends on the phone: (i) add a Today widget; (ii) add smart watch compatibility; (iii) show actual CGM values and trends on the lock screen notifications.", "Android compatibility (reportedly coming in 2016).", "Add statistics within the G5 app, or build out the Clarity iPhone app with more functionality.", "Enable users to take a picture of a meal instead of just manually logging the carbs in Events.", "Improve Events logging by integrating with other apps and devices (Fitbit, Strava, LoseIt!, myfitnesspal).", "Allow customization of the trend graph to prevent wasted white space.

Because CGM sensors are inserted into the interstitium, the CGM's software contains code that deduces actual blood sugar levels from the sensor readings at points in time.", "Absent greater accuracy, patients were still at risk of taking too much insulin, which can cause hypoglycemia.", "The G4 also offered a longer transmission range between its sensors and the receiver and a more user-friendly color LCD display than previous devices.", "In 2015, DexCom followed up the G4 with the G5. The G5 allowed patients to see real-time data on either a DexCom receiver or on any compatible device, including smartphones, via an app.", "The G5 also included an option to securely share real-time data with a caregiver, such as a parent, and it provided access to a cloud-based repository where data could be stored for review.", "Importantly, the G5 was the first DexCom CGM to do away with the need to confirm CGM readings with finger sticks prior to taking insulin.", "Although finger sticks were still necessary every 12 hours to calibrate the system, the advance significantly reduced the burden of finger sticks on patients.", "Ongoing technological advances, such as the G4 and G5, alongside growing acceptance of CGMs generally, has been a boon to the company's top line.", "Since 2008, DexCom's annual sales have increased from less than $10 million to $718.5 million in 2017 -- a compounded annual growth of nearly 57%.", "DexCom isn't the only company profiting from continuous glucose monitoring systems.", "Medtronic and Abbott Labs are deep-pocketed foes and each has recently launched compelling new devices for diabetes that challenge DexCom.", "After securing an unexpected early approval in 2016, Medtronic launched its MiniMed 670G in 2017.

Like the Freestyle Libre, DexCom's G6 eliminates the need for finger sticks, but unlike Abbott Labs' CGM, the G6's sensors only have a two-hour warm-up period.", "The G6 automatically communicates data between its sensors and a receiver and the receiver can be a smartphone or similar device, too.", "Alternatively, Abbott's receiver has to be held within 1.5 inches of its sensors to transfer data and there's no app yet that allows patients to use a smartphone or tablet as the receiver.", "Furthermore, the G6 warns patients of dangerous glucose readings with an alarm, while the Freestyle Libre doesn't.", "The G6 system uses smaller sensors than DexCom's G5 and its sensors can be applied to the skin with a new one-touch applicator that's easier to use.", "Additionally, the G6's sensors can be worn for 10 days while the G5 sensors are only approved for seven days of use.", "G6's features could help DexCom outcompete the Freestyle Libre, but what's most exciting about the G6 is that it's the first CGM to win FDA approval as a stand-alone system or as a CGM for use in automated insulin dosing systems.", "Currently, Medtronic is the only company marketing a closed-loop monitoring and insulin dosing system (the aforementioned MiniMed 670G), but insulin pump makers Insulet (PODD 1.08%) and Tandem Diabetes (TNDM -6.34%) are working on their own closed-loop systems and those systems are being designed for use with DexCom's CGMs.", "Studies for a system that pairs up the G5 with Insulet's Omnipod insulin pump are underway, and according to management, its closed-loop system could reach the market as soon as late 2019.", "Meanwhile, Tandem Diabetes is even closer to the finish line.

(67), the standardized AGP report was further developed by the International Diabetes Center and now incorporates all the core CGM metrics and targets along with a 14-day composite glucose profile as an integral component of clinical decision making (24).", "This recommendation was later endorsed at the aforementioned international consensus conference on CGM metrics (18) and is referenced as an example in the American Diabetes Association 2019 “Standards of Medical Care in Diabetes” (16) and in an update to the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists consensus on use of CGM (68).", "The AGP report, in slightly modified formats, has been adopted by most of the CGM device manufacturers in their download software.", "An example of the AGP report, updated to incorporate targets, is presented in Fig. 2.

Although time constraints and reimbursement issues are clearly obstacles, clinician inexperience in data interpretation and lack of standardization software for visualization of CGM data have also played a role (73).", "The proposed standardized report enables clinicians to readily identify important metrics such as the percentage of time spent within, below, and above each individual’s target range, allowing for greater personalization of therapy through shared decision making.", "Using the standardized report, the clinician can also address glucose variability (e.g., the coefficient of variation [%CV] metric) (74) or use the glucose management indicator (GMI) metric (75) to discuss the possible discrepancies noted in glucose exposure derived from CGM data versus the individual’s laboratory-measured A1C (41,76).", "With appropriate educational materials, time, and experience, clinicians will develop a systematic approach to CGM data analysis and the most effective ways to discuss the data with patients in person or remotely.", "Numerous studies have demonstrated the clinical benefits of early achievement of near-normal glycemic control in individuals with type 1 diabetes and type 2 diabetes (77–83).", "However, when advising people with diabetes, goal-setting must be collaborative and take into account the individual needs/capabilities of each patient and start with the goals that are most achievable.", "An early study by DeWalt et al. (84) found that setting small, achievable goals not only enhances people’s ability to cope with their diabetes, but that people with diabetes who set and achieved their goals often initiated additional behavioral changes on their own.", "One approach to consider is the SMART goal (Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, Time-bound) intervention, which is directly applicable to setting targets for time in ranges.", "First described by Lawlor and Hornyak in 2012 (85), this approach incorporates four key components of behavioral change relevant to goal setting: 1) the goal is specific and defines exactly what is to be achieved, 2) the goal is measurable and there is tangible evidence when it has been achieved, 3) the goal is achievable but stretches the patient slightly so that he/she feels challenged, and 4) the goal should be attainable over a short period of time.", "Effective goals should utilize CGM data to identify specific instances for the patient to take measurable action to prevent hypoglycemia.", "Although analysis of the AGP reports provides an opportunity for meaningful discussion, individuals should be counseled to look at patterns throughout the day to see when low glucose events are occurring and make adjustments in their therapy to reduce these events.", "When applying the CGM metrics in clinical practice, it may be more meaningful and motivating to communicate to people with diabetes the importance of working to reduce the time spent <70 mg/dL (<3.9 mmol/L) to less than 1 h per day and time spent <54 mg/dL (<3.0 mmol/L) to less than 15 min per day, rather than using <4% and <1%, respectively, as the goal.", "However, as discussed earlier, targets must be personalized to meet the needs and capabilities of each person, focusing on small steps and small successes.", "Individuals with diabetes should work with their provider and/or educator to develop a SMART goal to reduce TBR.", "Individualized goals are particularly important for pediatric and young adult populations. The International Society for Pediatric and Adolescent Diabetes recommends that targets for individuals ≤25 years of age aim for the lowest achievable A1C without undue exposure to severe hypoglycemia or negative effects on quality of life and burden of care (86).", "An A1C target of 7.0% (53 mmol/mol) can be used in children, adolescents, and adults ≤25 years old who have access to comprehensive care (86).", "However, a higher A1C goal (e.g., <7.5% [<58 mmol/mol]) may be more appropriate in the following situations: inability to articulate hypoglycemia symptoms, hypoglycemia unawareness, history of severe hypoglycemia, lack of access to analog insulins and/or advanced insulin delivery technology, or inability to regularly check glucose (86).", "This would equate to a TIR target of ∼60% (Table 4).", "The consensus group recognized that achieving the targets for the various time in ranges is aspirational in some situations, and many individuals will require ongoing support, both educational and technological, from their health care team.", "Importantly, as demonstrated by Beck et al. (26), Vigersky and McMahon (27), and Feig et al. (59), even small, incremental improvements yield significant glycemic benefits.", "Therefore, when advising individuals with diabetes (particularly children, adolescents, and high-risk individuals) about their glycemic goals, it is important to take a stepwise approach, emphasizing that what may appear to be small, incremental successes (e.g., 5% increase in TIR) are, in fact, clinically significant in improving their glycemia (26,27,59).", "However, when counseling women planning pregnancy and pregnant women, greater emphasis should be placed on getting to goal as soon as possible (59,60).", "Use of CGM continues to expand in clinical practice. As a component of diabetes self-management, daily use of CGM provides the ability to obtain immediate feedback on current glucose levels as well as direction and rate of change in glucose levels.", "This information allows people with diabetes to optimize dietary intake and exercise, make informed therapy decisions regarding mealtime and correction of insulin dosing, and, importantly, react immediately and appropriately to mitigate or prevent acute glycemic events (87–89).", "Retrospective analysis of CGM data, using standardized data management tools such as the AGP, enables clinicians and people with diabetes to work collaboratively in identifying problem areas and then set achievable goals (70–72).", "We conclude that, in clinical practice, time in ranges (within target range, below range, above range) are both appropriate and useful as clinical targets and outcome measurements that complement A1C for a wide range of people with diabetes and that the target values specified in this article should be considered an integral component of CGM data analysis and day-to-day treatment decision making.", "Acknowledgments.

yet been applied by federal policy or enforcement to a patient’s right to access his or her own medical device data.", "Device makers are currently left to decide on their own what level of data access to provide to patients.", "Patients should have the ability to use their data personally, to view all their data integrated together, and to share this information with family members, clinicians, or even with researchers if they desire.", "48 A system like Apple Health enables an individual to integrate together different sources of health data into one place, and then direct access to those data for use by any other software application.", "To date, some diabetes device makers have chosen to allow their data to be accessible in Apple Health.", "However, other device makers have chosen to keep their data access proprietary, limiting data access to only those companies with whom they have formed one-to-one business partnerships.", "Without full interoperability and easy API-based access to data, the utility patients can gain from diabetes device data will continue to be limited and restricted.", "As an example, the Companion InPen allows extensive data sharing—insulin dose data are shared with Apple Health as well as with Dexcom.", "This means that a user can choose to view InPen data in either the InPen app, Dexcom’s Clarity software, Tidepool, or Glooko, and conversely, Dexcom CGM data are viewable in the InPen app.", "When data are integrated like this, they are more easily visualized, facilitating more efficient and accurate interpretation

combined with CGM data.", "Additional work is required for effective team-based care and a satisfactory provider experience.", "Insulin Dosing Data Promotes Active Diabetes Management", "Software-based diabetes data review has been shown to improve diabetes outcomes. 49 Retrospective CGM review can be a powerful educational tool and has been shown to increase patient-provider discussion in clinical visits.", "50 On the other hand, lack of timely data access to facilitate a diabetes visit can lead to therapeutic inertia.", "51 Therefore, by filling data gaps and adding complete and accurate information about insulin dosing data in the context of glucose control, SIPs present an opportunity to facilitate the patient-provider interaction and aid in timely clinical decision-making.", "Issues such as fear, stigma, and cost often drive a patient’s reluctance to use insulin therapy as prescribed.", "52 When using SIPs, discussions about a PWD’s insulin delivery history can be objective, and more easily seen by patient and provider, potentially leading to more frequent and open conversations about patient concerns, reluctance, or other habits around insulin dosing.", "In a recent patient encounter in our practice, a retrospective review of insulin data made it clear that the patient was frequently missing mealtime insulin boluses (see Figure 3).", "After reviewing the SIP report together, and without requiring significant discussion or explanation on part of provider or patient, the patient changed his behavior and increased his frequency of meal-time insulin boluses.", "As new sources of diabetes data emerge and are connected to care, effective engagement of the full diabetes care team is possible.", "In addition to providers, data can also be reviewed by dieticians, diabetes educators, and health coaches to encourage behavior change with food, adherence, or other aspects of daily diabetes management.", "When patients need access to additional support, coaching from digital services is an option.", "Data Integration and Machine Learning Will Augment Diabetes Management", "While providers benefit from the additional data captured by SIPs and are better able to fine-tune individualized treatment parameters, this work takes time and energy.", "Humans are inherently unable to leverage the vast quantities of available data. Machine learning may prove to be more effective and efficient in reviewing the data and aiding in recommending adjustments to insulin settings.", "To date, companies exist to do this for hospitalized patients on insulin infusions53-55 and for outpatients using insulin pumps,56,57 and we expect to see similar technology emerge to better aid in interpretation and titration of insulin pen doses.", "While tailored adjustments of insulin dosing regimens have traditionally been the job of an Endocrinologist, advanced decision support driven by machine learning may increasingly empower primary care providers to care for patients using complex MDI therapy.", "Provider Experience and Clinic Integration Need to be Optimized", "Currently, routine integration of diabetes devices into office-based care is inefficient and cumbersome.", "Broad uptake of these new devices will require a focus on data accessibility and usability for the clinic staff, provider, and clinical team, with improvements required in several areas (see Table 2):", "| 1.

Prescribing an InPen to date has required an order form that asks for insulin dose settings much like an insulin pump start form.", "This may erect a barrier to prescribing from a broader set of providers who may be intimidated by this or put off by the friction and time required.", "(5) Easily onboard patients to connect their data to cloud and clinic accounts. Investing time upfront to help patients share data, connect devices, and learn how to access retrospective data is time-saving and will facilitate telehealth-based digital care delivery.", "(6) Automate reminders to patients to connect or upload data before a check-in, avoiding clinic visit time wasted trying to upload device data.", "As the focus in health care increasingly shifts toward high value care, allocating resources strategically within a group of patients becomes important.", "One could foresee identifying patients with poor diabetes control, frequent healthcare utilization, or otherwise medically complex as ideal candidates to receive SIP therapy.", "With the digital tools to promote insulin safety, high risk patient groups may benefit from SIP use.", "Objective data capture allows better evaluation of adherence, and providers can more closely offer support.", "It has been shown with insulin pump therapy that individuals with poor diabetes control and those considered medically complex still benefit from the technology,60,61 and we expect the same to apply with SIPs.", "Just as CGM data can be used to stratify patients into risk categories, 62 and as insulin pump reports have been used to identify behavioral patterns, SIP data could similarly be used.", "A clinic dashboard could identify PWD who are frequently missing boluses and allow targeted outreach to promote improved dosing strategies.", "The dashboard could identify those with sudden changes in insulin usage and escalate their care to a provider.", "We could identify people who consistently struggle with carbohydrate estimation and offer focused education.", "Achieving these opportunities also requires a connected data ecosystem where population-level dashboards enable simultaneous visualization of aggregated data from the EHR, CGM, and SIPs.", "The Future of Connected Care Is Increasingly Asynchronous and Continuous", "Current typical practice involves a periodic clinic visit at standard intervals, which may then take advantage of data review from devices.", "In the future, patient care should involve more targeted, frequent, data-driven check-ins leveraging glucose monitoring and insulin dosing data.", "To meet this future state, every diabetes device must contain the ability for seamless, passive, real-time data flow.", "63 Cloud-based continuous streaming of data allows patients to be connected with care teams and offers the possibility for asynchronous, virtual connection.", "For example, after an initial synchronous consultation, subsequent care could be conducted asynchronously and virtually, with integrated SIP and CGM data reviewed within a few weeks of the original visit.", "64 These easier, quicker interactions might drive more frequent check-ins and reduce clinical inertia.", "Shifting to a model of care driven by patient need, rather than by provider availability and clinic schedules will require systemic changes.", "Providers will need new reimbursement models, along with sufficient time, and administrative and leadership support.", "The SIP, as a connected digital diabetes tool, has the potential to improve diabetes care for millions of PWD on insulin therapy (see Table 3).", "Users of SIPs benefit from digital tools that provide easier insulin dose calculation, dose reminders, and facilitate hypoglycemia avoidance.", "Iterative software updates will speed new benefits to SIP users. Automatic data capture of insulin dose data, particularly when paired with glucose data, can help counter therapeutic inertia, and allow patients and providers to make data-driven decisions.", "As we move toward a connected care future, the benefits of broad use of SIPs—machine learning, asynchronous and virtual care, risk stratification—hinge on the success of a connected diabetes data ecosystem in which data flow is frictionless, data integration is standard, and care delivery workflows are reimagined.", "| Patients | Safety and hypoglycemia avoidance | Bolus calculator on paired smartphone app accounts for insulin on board and recommends tailored insulin doses based on user input.", "| Smartphone app supports dosing reminders | Users can enable reminders and alarms.

In people, a CGM may be directly linked to an insulin delivery system.", "BOX 1 describes the sensor application procedure. After application, the sensor is paired with the monitor.", "It is then ready to take readings in as little as 60 minutes. Scan the sensor at least every 8 hours to ensure data is being transmitted to the monitor.", "Some patients may tolerate wearing a t-shirt or bandage over the sensor; this does not interfere with data transmission.", "1. Gather the necessary materials, including clippers, alcohol wipes, sensor, gloves, and medical adhesive.", "2. Select and shave an application site (FIGURE A). This site should be difficult for the patient to reach, have limited subcutaneous motion and sufficient interstitial space for the sensor to be placed, and be comfortable for the patient.", "Common locations include the caudal cervical, caudodorsal to scapula, lateral epaxial, and caudodorsal thoracic regions.", "The ideal location for placement of a CGM in dogs and cats has been investigated, but has not been yet optimized.1,2 The shaved area should be just large enough for the sensor, about 2 to 3 square inches.", "3. Clean the shaved area with an alcohol wipe and allow it to dry.", "4. Because of the variable adhesiveness of cat and dog skin, a medical adhesive may be used to help keep the CGM in place (FIGURE B).", "Apply the adhesive in a doughnut-shaped pattern and allow it to partially dry. Alternatively, tissue glue may be used; however, it will make removal of the sensor more difficult.", "5. Check the sensor and applicator device lot numbers and expiration dates.

Gently remove the application device (FIGURE E).", "Accuracy and Correlation With Blood Glucose Measurement", "It is important to remember that the interstitial glucose concentration, also called sensor glucose (SG), is not the same as the blood glucose concentration (BG).", "The relationship between intravascular and interstitial glucose is quite complex,3 and differences between SG and BG readings are expected.", "Briefly, because it takes time for glucose to diffuse from the intravascular to the interstitial space, changes in SG lag behind those in BG.", "This lag time has been shown to be as little as 5 to 6 minutes in humans,4-6 and estimated to be 5 to 12 minutes in dogs.7", "This timeframe is short enough that clinical decision regarding insulin or glucose therapy will be impacted minimally.", "Some human studies have demonstrated a close correlation of SG and BG, particularly when BG levels are stable.7-9 However, with large swings in BG—which are common in veterinary patients with diabetes—the magnitude of BG peaks, troughs, and changes (such as with insulin therapy) are more pronounced than those in interstitial glucose.", "In the author’s experience, SG may be up to 20 mg/dL (1.1 mmol/L) lower than BG at peak levels. Nonetheless, acceptable correlation has been found in diabetic dogs and cats, and SG readings are considered accurate estimates of BG in dogs with diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA).10-12", "The first CGMs were bulky, had cumbersome cords, required charging stations, did not provide immediate readings, and required calibration several times a day with ear-prick PBGM readings.", "In addition, the data obtained on these older models could only be viewed after the monitoring session had been completed and the information was downloaded to a computer.13,14", "Current CGM models are smaller, factory calibrated, and allow real-time access to reliable SG readings within 1 to 2 hours of placement.", "They also adhere much better to dog and cat skin and have a low profile, making them well tolerated by most veterinary patients with a high rate of success in use.1,2 The Freestyle Libre 14 (Abbott, freestylelibre.us) and Dexcom G6 (Dexcom, dexcom.com) are affordable, commercially available, water resistant, and user friendly for owners and allow veterinarians to remotely access collected data.", "CGMs have the potential to eliminate the need for in-hospital glucose curves performed with multiple blood draws or ear pricks.15 By avoiding the need for multiple blood draws, they also eliminate the need to place a sampling catheter, thereby minimizing patient stress, discomfort, and potential for adverse effects, such as iatrogenic anemia and hematoma.", "CGMs have been used to detect clinically relevant hypo- and hyperglycemic episodes in dogs.16 They can also collect data at times that were not previously feasible (e.g., while patient is asleep) and in situations where owners were unwilling or unable to collect glucose measurements at home.", "Other advantages of CGMs include the use of fewer resources (e.g., needles, strips, central lines, syringes) and less staff time, the ability to more rapidly adjust insulin therapy, and the ability to collect data from fractious patients, thereby improving staff safety.", "Few complications are associated with their use, and they have been determined to be sufficiently accurate for making therapeutic changes in veterinary patients.17", "CGMs may be valuable for a variety of diabetic patients: those with a new diagnosis, those with poorly regulated diabetes, and those with complications of diabetes, such as hypoglycemia (insulin overdose or alterations of insulin requirements), DKA, and hyperosmolar states (BOX 2).", "Initial physical examination and routine blood work findings demonstrated that the patient was dehydrated and in hypovolemic shock secondary to diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA).", "After volume resuscitation and rehydration, she became fractious with handling and blood collection. She was sedated for placement of a continuous glucose monitor (CGM; FIGURE A) and hospitalized for 3 days for treatment of DKA.", "She received an insulin constant-rate infusion, and the CGM was used to monitor sensor glucose (SG); she tolerated the device well.", "The patient was sent home with the CGM and treated with glargine insulin (1 U SC q12h). The CGM sensor dislodged 5 days later.", "Two months after discharge, the owner reported that the patient was doing well but still had PU/PD; her in-house blood glucose (single check) was 350 mg/dL. The insulin dose was increased to 1.5 U q12h and a second CGM was placed.", "Seven days later, the patient unintentionally removed the CGM. The collected data were sent to the veterinarian and demonstrated adequate diabetic control (FIGURE B).", "Achieving glucose stability within 3 months of diagnosis has been shown to result in longer survival time in dogs, and successful at-home monitoring is associated with remission of diabetes mellitus in cats.18,19 The current standard for monitoring patients with diabetes mellitus is generation of ear-prick glucose curves on which recommendations regarding insulin dose can be based.", "Many owners are willing to perform this monitoring in the hospital, and some may be willing to do it at home; however, it has been demonstrated that the results of a glucose curve performed at home are significantly different from those obtained in the hospital, and this may affect insulin dose.15 Use of CGMs to collect home glucose curves may help primary care veterinarians achieve consistent results on which to base dose recommendations, although this has yet to be investigated.", "A CGM used to manage a single dog with DKA demonstrated that periods of hypo- and hyperglycemia that were not detected with standard PBGM techniques may be identified with a CGM;20 this advantage may become apparent in future studies and improve monitoring of these patients.", "Use of CGMs can also safely facilitate the use of more intensive insulin therapy in patients with DKA.", "Recent veterinary evidence supports such therapy, including use of long- and short-acting insulin in combination, higher doses of insulin, and early institution of insulin therapy.21-23 This more intensive insulin therapy has resulted in faster resolution of acidemia and ketosis, improved appetite, and shorter hospitalization times.", "Patients with hypoglycemia from a variety of other disease processes, such as sepsis, insulinoma, xylitol ingestion, neoplasia, or liver disease, may benefit from monitoring with CGMs; use of CGMs for these conditions has not been investigated.", "Studies of CGM use in patients undergoing anesthesia have found some variability in accuracy.24-26", "No commercially available CGM has been approved for veterinary use; however, some veterinary distributors now carry these devices for sale to veterinary clinics.", "A prescription is required for an owner to obtain one from a human pharmacy. Prices vary by pharmacy and geographic location; at the time of publication, a Freestyle Libre 14-day sensor cost $73 to $121, and the optional reusable reader cost $89 to $153.", "For the amount of information these devices provide, this cost is relatively low, and may even be less expensive than a traditional glucose curve at many hospitals.", "A standard glucose curve is based on 8 to 10 readings collected over a single day. By contrast, the Dexcom G6 takes a reading every 5 minutes and the Freestyle Libre every 1 minute (totaling more than 1400 readings per day) over the course of several days.", "These data can be displayed in a variety of ways to give clinicians a better understanding of glucose trends and management of the patient.", "Feeding, exercise, and sleep cycles can be monitored as well. CGMs may be able to detect previously unobserved persistent hyperglycemia and Somogyi events.27,28", "If the SG is out of the sensor’s range (40 to 400 mg/dL [2.2 to 22.2 mmol/L] for the G6, 40 to 500 mg/dL", "[2.2 to 28 mmol/L] for the Freestyle), the monitor displays a HI or LO alert. This should prompt collection of an ear-prick sample to be read by a PBGM.", "The readers designed for use with the Freestyle and Dexcom systems include a PBGM in the handheld monitor; however, separate test strips are required, and these have not been validated for veterinary species.", "Data collected by the Freestyle Libre system may be displayed on the handheld monitor or, after downloading, on a computer (FIGURES 3 AND 4).", "On the monitor, individual SG readings are clearly displayed along with an arrow showing the recent trend and any necessary alerts.", "Daily graphs or percentage of time in target range may be displayed (FIGURE 3). When the data are downloaded, the entire recording period can be summarized, specific parameters analyzed, or events on individual days displayed (FIGURE 4).", "CGMs do have limitations. In veterinary patients, even with correct placement technique, a percentage of sensors do not function properly or may not work at all in individual patients.", "In one study, as many as 10% to 25% of sensors failed even when placed in the best location by veterinary professionals.2 Patient or sensor movement, limited subcutaneous space (body condition), adhesive failure, bleeding, biofouling, and other factors may all affect sensor performance.", "In addition, although current CGMs are designed for 10- or 14-day use, this should be considered their maximum useful time.", "In the author’s experience, most CGMs last 5 to 10 days in veterinary patients and provide a significant amount of data in that time.", "The author has observed failure rates similar to those in the abovementioned study, including failure of two or more sensors on a single patient.", "Incorporation of CGMs into practice requires client education, as well as sensor placement and data interpretation.", "All of these processes require valuable veterinarian and staff time, and charging appropriately for this time is necessary.", "With the improvements in CGM technology in the past 2 decades and ongoing development, use of CGMs is likely to become much more common in veterinary patients with diabetes.", "Long-acting, subcutaneous sensors are already available for human patients; when these sensors are paired to an insulin pump, the result is, essentially, a synthetic endocrine pancreas.", "This technology is being developed and tested in veterinary patients and may be available in the future.29,30", "Because veterinarians do not have to manage diabetic patients for decades (avoiding some of the long-term effects seen in human patients), the tight glucose control that is desired in human medicine may never be a goal of veterinary medicine, and some more advanced applications may not apply to veterinary patients.", "However, even with current technology, management of diabetic patients can improve drastically.", "1.

Notably, in discussing the high rates of hypoglycemia despite outcome benefit in their recently published RCT in pediatric critical care, Vlasselaers et al. state that \"...for future studies, an accurate continuous blood glucose sensor for use in the PICU...would be preferable to keep the risk of hypoglycaemia to a minimum", "CGMs, which regularly assess interstitial glucose levels, have been developed, approved, and marketed for outpatient diabetes management.", "Although ICU practitioners support the concept of utilizing such devices, many have dismissed the potential use of such technology in critical care settings.", "Their argument is that there may be an inaccuracy of interstitial glucose values compared to blood levels in patients with edema, poor perfusion, or in those requiring vasoactive infusions.", "Despite these theoretical drawbacks of CGM and interstitial glucose assessments, little evidence exists to substantiate these concerns.", "There is now a small cohort of limited studies of approximately 160 adult and pediatric ICU patients suggesting that there is a reasonable correlation between CGM and BG measurements [17–27].", "We report one of the largest studies to date evaluating a Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved, commercially available CGM in a critical care setting.", "We assessed patients that our previous studies have proved to be at increased risk for critical illness hyperglycemia [12, 14, 15, 28, 29].", "Currently, there is debate on which is the gold standard blood supply (that is, arterial vs. venous) to assess BG.", "In daily management, ICUs likely use the most convenient and accessible vascular bed for blood glucose determination and glycemic management, including capillary sampling.", "Our study may provide generalizable and relevant data for practitioners and staff who may use different sources for BG measurements.", "In all patients and in subpopulation analysis based on age, diagnosis, and ICU support measures, we found a high correlation between CGM readings and standard BG measurements per Clarke error grid and Bland-Altman analysis.", "Although some vasoactive medications can result in peripheral vasoconstriction, this did not affect the accuracy of interstitial readings in our study.", "Correlation was also strong in those requiring CRRT and/or ECMO, despite significant edema and vascular leak syndrome in these patients.", "A 2005 report demonstrated that a CGM device attached to an ECMO circuit providing support for pediatric patients, could supply reasonable glucose readings [30].", "Our study appears to be the first to evaluate CGMs on patients who required ECMO, with the important note that sensors were placed on patients before they were placed on ECMO.", "Patients who were more severely ill according to traditional illness severity indicators (PELOD scores, ICU lengths of stay) had excellent correlation between CGM and standard readings.", "In fact, those with an ICU stay of less than three days had the lowest Clark Zone A correlation in our analysis.", "This may be due to the fact that the precision of CGMs may improve with time after insertion. It is interesting to note that one study that found a poor correlation of CGMs in hospitalized patients, sensors were in place for a maximum of three days [27].", "In addition, while some have questioned the utility of such devices in very small pediatric patients, we found excellent correlation in patients <12 months of age.", "Also, we found excellent correlation in pediatric ICU patients who were hyperglycemic and managed with an insulin infusion.", "A number of CGM devices have been approved for outpatient use in children and adults [31–33]. FDA approval applications have been supported by 90 to 99% Clarke A + B correlation between CGM and standard BG readings, and 1.6 to 10% of clinically inaccurate readings (Zone C + D + E).", "Such applications cite studies evaluating approximately 20 to 137 patients [34–36]. Findings from our study of 47 participants, with Zone A + B of 97.9% and Zone B + C + D of 2.1%, are consistent with criteria used in other venues to determine acceptable accuracy.", "In addition, we found no untoward effects of CGM use. Although critically ill patients often have coagulopathies, we found no evidence of bleeding with device use.", "Of note, sensors were not inserted when a known severe coagulopathy was present. In addition, we also found no site infections, reactions, or significant discomfort noted with sensor placement or use.", "Our data provide some of the most robust evidence to date that these devices can be used safely and provide clinically meaningful information, even in the smallest and most critically ill pediatric patients.", "In conjunction with other CGM studies in ICU settings, it may be reasonable to consider incorporating the use of such devices into critical care practice, albeit with some important limitations.", "We found that there is a significant time and educational component needed to learn to insert, calibrate and assess these devices.", "We also frequently kept sensors in place for longer than the FDA-recommended time. This sensor is currently approved for 72 hours of use in the outpatient setting, and there are no guidelines for their use in the ICU setting.", "However, there are reports of these sensors being accurate and safe for longer than the 72-hour period [37].", "Medtronic has recently completed a study testing the use of this sensor for six days in an inpatient setting, and these results are pending [38].", "Although our findings demonstrate a strong correlation even with extended use, we did not make any clinical management decisions based on CGM readings.", "Only after further study in clinical trials should such devices be used to assist in titrating insulin during hyperglycemia management in critical care settings.", "Active diagnosis and/or management of glucose disturbances in ICU settings should only occur with time-tested BG measurements.", "The current state of evidence in this field may support the use of such devices to trend patient BGs, and setting high and low alarms to trigger standard BG assessment may assist in improving the efficacy and safety of glycemic control approaches.", "We experienced very few hypoglycemic episodes in this study, and thus the accuracy of CGM in low-normal or hypoglycemic ranges is unclear.", "Anecdotally, although our staff was essentially blind to the readings of these monitors, there were times when the \"low\" BG alarm was triggered, prompting our staff to perform a routine BG check.", "In one notable case, a hyperglycemic patient treated with insulin had her intravenous fluids switched from a high to low dextrose-containing fluid without a change in insulin dosing.", "The patient was not due to receive a routine BG check, but after the CGM alarmed, a POC BG was performed and confirmed a low reading.", "The IV fluid discrepancy was noted, and the insulin infusion was changed. As such, the most important utility of CGMs at this time may be to trigger standard BG checks to improve the safety of glycemic control.", "Data from CGM devices will likely add to the understanding of glycemic control in the critically ill patient.", "As shown in Figure 4, obtaining daily glucose trends via CGM may help to identify the percent of time spent outside of goal target ranges.", "Accurate, real-time assessment of area-under-the-curve metrics can be obtained from CGM devices. This may provide more meaningful data compared to approaches currently used to define and compare glycemic control.", "Critically ill children encompass one of the widest spectrums of patients, in terms of size and condition, in any ICU setting.", "The severity of illness and support measures of patients in this study were considerable. It may be reasonable to consider that if CGMs function well in our study population, they will likely function well in most other ICU populations, whether pediatric, adult, medical, or surgical.", "Yet, there will likely be scenarios where CGM performance will be sub-standard, and careful assessment during its use is required.", "Despite the proven benefits of glycemic control in many critical care settings, there are recognized risks of this approach and more studies are needed to better define optimal BG target ranges in the spectrum of ICU patients.", "Our study adds to the body of evidence that refutes the theoretical concerns regarding the use of CGM devices in the ICU setting.", "There is no doubt that future technologies will help advance the field of glycemic control in critical illness.", "The evidence may now support the use of currently available CGMs to assist with the safety and efficacy of glycemic control in critical illness.", "Further study and application for clinical approval of CGM use in ICU settings should be paramount in the international effort to better understand critical illness hyperglycemia.", "Hyperglycemia, hypoglycemia and glucose variability are associated with poor outcomes in critical illness.", "However, recent studies on the control of critical illness hyperglycemia have shown unacceptably high rates of iatrogenic

The guidelines recommend less stringent targets in patients who are unable to communicate their symptoms or who have hypoglycemia unawareness, recurrent severe hypoglycemia, lack of access to insulin analogs and advanced insulin delivery technology, or inability to regularly monitor BG levels (6, 7, 82).", "While it is well-recognized that attaining these targets is challenging for many patients, nonetheless, the potential benefit of small improvements should be emphasized: a 5% increase in TIR has been linked to significant improvements in overall glycemic control (84, 85).", "The expert consensus panel also recommended that additional CGM metrics for clinical care be standardized in the ambulatory glucose profile (AGP), including: the number of days the CGM was worn (goal 14/14 days), mean glucose, percentage of time >180 mg/dL (10.0 mmol/L) (goal <25%), percentage of time >250 mg/dL (13.9 mmol/L) (goal <5%), percentage of time <70 mg/dL (<3.9 mmol/L) (goal <4%), percentage of time <54 mg/dL (3.0 mmol/L) (goal <1%), and the coefficient of variation, a measure of glycemic variability (goal ≤ 36%).", "Figure 1. An example of how CGM metrics are displayed in a standardized ambulatory glucose profile (AGP).", "(A) Average glucose, (B) Time very low (<54 mg/dL), (C) Time low (<70 mg/dL), (D) Time in target range (70–180 mg/dL), (E) Time high (>180 mg/dL), (F) Time very high (> 250 mg/dL), (G) Coefficient of variation, (H) Percentage of time CGM is active.", "In the top figure, the hatched area shows the target range; composite data for 14-days are shown as median (orange line), interquartile range (blue shaded area), 10 and 90th percentiles (green dashed line).", "Improvements in the accuracy and usability of CGM, better insurance coverage, and greater acceptance by both clinicians and patients have led to dramatic increases in the use of this technology over the past decade (86–95).", "In the German and Austrian population-based DPV registry, 38% of all patients were using CGMs in 2017 as compared to 3% in 2006 and 17% in 2016.", "The highest rates (58%) of CGM use were seen in preschool aged children (96). In 2011, just 6% of all patients in the United States Type 1 Diabetes Exchange (T1DX) registry were using CGMs as compared to 27% in the period from 2016 to 2018 (91).", "Again, the highest rate of CGM use was seen in young children with 51% of patients under 6 years using CGMs, as compared to the lowest rates of use in adolescents and young adults with only 22% of 18–26 years olds using the technology.", "Marked healthcare disparities persist in access to and use of CGMs. Wong et al. found that CGM use was more likely to be used among T1DX participants with higher education levels, higher household incomes, and private insurance (87).", "These previously described differences in CGM access by race and ethnicity have persisted in the most recent analysis of the T1DX data from 2016 to 2018 (91).", "While non-Hispanic white children with T1D in the US are more likely to come from higher income families and to have private insurance, the disparities in access to CGM persist even after controlling for these factors.", "This trend suggests that there may be clinician bias in prescribing this technology despite evidence from an RCT that CGM use is equally beneficial for children of different racial and ethnic groups (97).", "Analysis of the T1DX data has also highlighted the impact of CGM use on glycemic control: among patients <13 years of age, the average A1c in participants using injection therapy and BGM was 9.0% compared to 8.0% in those using injections and CGMs, and 7.9% in those using insulin pumps and CGMs (91).", "Similar trends were seen in adolescents 13–18 years of age although the mean A1c levels were higher in all 3 groups: 9.6% in those using injections and BGM, 8.8% in those using injections and CGMs, and 8.3% in those using pumps and CGMs.", "In addition to reductions in A1c, the increasing use of CGMs has been associated with decreased hypoglycemia and severe hypoglycemia (98, 99).", "This finding is particularly notable as improvements in A1c in the DCCT came at the expense of increased rates of severe hypoglycemia (4).", "Importantly, regular use of CGMs with ≥ 6 days of wear per week is essential for attaining these improved clinical outcomes (97, 99).", "Early studies using less accurate CGMs suggested that continuous glucose monitoring had minimal positive impact on quality of life (QoL) and, possibly, even a negative impact attributable to sleep disruption and an increased need to support those providing childcare (98, 100).", "However, Mauras et al. studied use of CGMs in children aged 4 to <10 years and found that CGM use is associated with increased parental satisfaction and feelings of safety (101).", "Randomized controlled trials of adults with T1D have shown that use of newer CGM devices positively impacts QoL by reducing diabetes distress, increasing confidence to detect hypoglycemia, and decreasing diabetes management related interpersonal tension with family and friends (102).", "A recently published study of a pediatric population similarly showed reduced fear of hypoglycemia, improved diabetes treatment satisfaction, and improved parental sleep quality (103).", "Physical discomfort, body image concerns, the need to be connected to the device at all times, frequent alarms that disrupt daily life, and the expense of the technology are all frequently cited patient concerns regarding CGM use (44, 104–107).", "Parents of young children with T1D indicate that they would like to receive targeted formal education to improve their knowledge of these technologies, thereby reducing the burden of diabetes management (108).", "Adolescents with more depressive symptoms and lower overall and diabetes-specific quality of life are less likely to use CGMs suggesting that recognition of these factors and appropriate intervention may improve device uptake in this population (109).", "Further research exploring the psychosocial impact of CGM use is needed to better understand current barriers and limitations to use of CGMs in an effort to overcome barriers and increase uptake (110).", "Problems with adhesion can impact wear time and may be a source of great frustration, particularly given the cost of these devices.", "Patients are often advised to avoid placing a CGM sensor immediately after bathing and to consider the potential for trauma and friction when selecting an insertion site.", "Strategies to optimize adhesion vary from one patient to another, often requiring trial and error (111).", "Liquid adhesive agents are often helpful and can be supplemented with adhesive patches and tape over top of the CGM sensor.", "Skin integrity is also a significant concern, particularly for people with sensitive skin and those who also use an insulin pump (111).", "Although there is little evidence-based research to guide recommendations for preserving skin integrity, current literature recommends: rotating sites to give previously used sites time to heal completely before a new sensor is inserted, and using a barrier solution or dressing (e.g., Tegaderm™) between the skin and the sensor adhesive to minimize contact and irritation.", "Table 9 shows an overview of the benefits and limitations of continuous glucose monitoring.", "Future Directions in Continuous Glucose Monitoring", "Factors limiting CGM uptake among patients are areas targeted for future develpoments in continuous glucose monitoring technologies.", "The on body footprint of these devices remains one of the greatest concerns among adults with T1D (105).", "Industry is currently developing smaller devices with longer wear times with the potential for direct transmission of CGM data from the transmitter to a smart watch without the need for a nearby smart phone to serve as a receiver.", "Others are seeking to develop devices that combine insulin infusion cannulas with CGM sensors into a single device.", "Current product labeling prohibits insulin delivery at the CGM sensor site and recent studies have identified insulin preservatives as the major cause of CGM inaccuracy when these devices are in close proximity (112).", "While understanding current limiting factors paves a path forward for future research and development, there is also a need to prolong insulin infusion site wear time beyond the recommended 2–3 days in order to match CGM sensor wear time (113).", "The rate of production of ketone bodies is increased during starvation, consumption of very low carbohydrate diets, prolonged strenuous exercise, and in individuals with uncontrolled diabetes.", "In the liver, ß-oxidation of free fatty acids released from adipose tissue produces acetoacetic acid, which is reduced to beta-hydroxybutyric acid (BOHB), thereby regenerating NAD+.", "Acetone is produced by non-enzymatic decarboxylation of acetoacetate and is formed in relatively small amounts compared with acetoacetate and BOHB.", "The term ketone bodies refers to acetoacetate, BOHB and acetone. During resolution of ketosis and ketoacidosis, BOHB is first converted back into acetoacetate and then, in a series of biochemical reactions, eventually yields acetyl CoA for oxidation in the Krebs cycle.", "Monitoring for the presence and severity of ketosis in appropriate circumstances is an essential component of the care of patients with T1D. See Table 10 for indications to check ketones.", "Ketone monitoring (based on the nitroprusside reaction) can be performed using urine test strips that measure acetoacetate and acetone.", "Urine test strips individually wrapped in foil to prevent exposure to air are recommended to ensure accuracy.", "Alternatively, blood BOHB concentration can be measured with specific meters available for use at home (in USA, Precision Xtra or Nova Max® Plus; in Europe, Abbott FreeStyle Optium, FreeStyle Optium Neo, and Menarini GlucoMen LX Plus).", "These devices can also measure BG using different test strips.", "Urine ketone monitoring is semi-quantitative; after carefully timing the reaction (15 s), the result is determined by comparing the color on the test strip with a color code on the strip container.", "Results may be negative, trace (5 mg/dL), small (15 mg/dL), moderate (40 mg/dL), or large (80–160 mg/dL).", "False negative readings may occur when strips have been exposed to air or when urine is highly acidic (e.g., after consumption of large doses of ascorbic acid).", "Urine ketone tests can give false positive results in patients who take valproic acid or any sulfhydryl-containing drugs, including captopril.", "The increasing popularity of very low carbohydrate diets for T1D management has raised new questions about baseline ketone levels in patients who adhere to these diets (114).", "Urine ketone testing is inexpensive and simple to perform; however, obtaining a urine sample may be challenging for parents of infants and young children, especially during an intercurrent illness.", "Blood BOHB levels have been correlated with urine ketone levels (Table 11). However, it should be appreciated that when an illness causes dehydration, the urine ketone measurement may be “moderate” or “large” in a concentrated urine specimen, whereas the concomitant blood BOHB level is only mildly increased.", "Measurement of blood BOHB concentration is quantitative and accurate up to ~5 mmol/L; however, blood ketone strips are considerably more expensive than urine ketone strips.", "Nonetheless, when compared to urine ketone testing, measurement of blood BOHB concentration may be cost-effective because it provides quantitative information that frequently allows parents (with guidance from their diabetes care team) to more confidently manage a sick child at home obviating the need to bring the patient to an emergency department for evaluation and treatment (115).", "Blood BOHB monitoring at home also offers the advantage of accurately assessing biochemical improvement after providing supplemental insulin (116, 117).", "When cost is a consideration, a recommended approach is to reserve blood ketone measurements for young children who cannot reliably provide a urine sample on demand and in patients who have “large” urine ketones.", "It is important to appreciate that mild fasting ketosis before breakfast may occur in young children with T1D in the absence of illness or metabolic deterioration (118).", "The urine nitroprusside test measures acetoacetate and acetone. During ketone metabolism, BOHB is converted back into acetoacetate, which can result in prolonged ketonuria even after significant ketosis has already responded to treatment and serum BOHB has decreased to normal levels.", "Prolonged ketonuria can also be exacerbated by long periods of time between voiding and accumulation of older urine with a higher concentration of ketones in the bladder.", "Persistent ketonuria after resolution of hyperketonemia can lead to unnecessary additional insulin administration as the result of a misguided desire to rapidly “clear” the urine ketones and can cause hypoglycemia.", "Monitoring blood BOHB concentrations obviates this problem as its concentration reflects the rate of ketogenesis and predictably decreases in response to effective insulin therapy.", "Although currently not approved for use in children and adolescents with T1D, sodium-glucose cotransporter (SGLT) inhibitors are associated with an increased risk of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) with only mild hyperglycemia or no hyperglycemia (euglycemic ketoacidosis).", "Preventing DKA in patients taking these medications relies on patients measuring blood or urine ketone levels whenever nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain or lethargy occurs (119).", "In conclusion, regular monitoring of BG and ketone levels, in appropriate circumstances, is essential for optimal management of pediatric T1D. Frequent BGM improves A1c while also decreasing hypo- and hyperglycemia.", "Whereas, BGM has been the cornerstone of T1D management for decades, with increasing accuracy, cost-effectiveness and acceptance of CGM, this technology is expected to become the universal standard of care in the near future.", "A thorough understanding of CGM technology, including factors affecting its accuracy, is critical in order for clinicians to thoroughly educate and guide patients in its use.", "It is important to recognize that CGM has limitations and can fail; therefore, BGM must be available for backup and must remain an essential component of comprehensive T1D care.", "Monitoring of urine or blood ketone levels when indicated, coupled with BGM and appropriate intervention, can often prevent progression from ketosis to ketoacidosis and obviate the need for care in an emergency department and admission to hospital.", "BM and JW contributed equally to the literature review and writing of this article and accountable for the content.", "The authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential conflict of interest.", "The authors are grateful to Julie Slaats, RN, CPNP, CDE, and Kristina Kissiova, MD for their critical review of this article.", "1.

However, it is difficult to establish whether those changes would have resulted in clinical benefits, considering that these patients were having a low rate of hypoglycemia before lockdown and thus further improvements would have been challenging.", "In teenagers, CGM metrics were mostly comparable between the time period antecedent to the prelockdown (with schools opened) and the prelockdown (with school closed), except for a slight reduction in glucose variability (lower SDglu).", "Interestingly, no further changes were detected in the during the lockdown period. The data in teenagers led us to speculate that T1D management may be relatively independent of the heavy changes imposed by the lockdown.", "We can also propose that the influence of the family environment for T1D control may be less relevant in teenagers, differently from children, due to the progressive detachment from the family characterizing that period of life due to the desire for independence and autonomy.", "Adult patients with T1D showed a significant improvement in the majority of the CGM metrics during lockdown period when compared with the prelockdown.", "Interestingly, no difference at all was detected between the 20 days antecedent to the prelockdown (corresponding to the schools-open period) and the 20 days immediately before lockdown, meaning that all changes in T1D management were strictly related to lockdown.", "Those data are in line with the results of a recent study, published while our article was still under writing.13 The study by Bonora et al investigated three time periods, 3 months before, 1 week before and 1 week after lockdown in Italy in 33 patients with T1D, showing a beneficial effect of lockdown on average glucose and SDglu, derived by CGM (FreeStyle Libre device).", "Additionally, most of the changes in CGM metrics were related to improvement in TIR and reduction of hyperglycemia (measured as TAR), whereas no difference in TBR was detected.", "The authors concluded that beneficial effects on glucose management in adults with T1D might be detected early after lockdown.13 Even though this study has relevant differences with the present study, including the number of subjects, the selection criteria of the patients, the outpatient setting, and the design of the study, our results perfectly fit, providing support to the hypothesis that T1D management may improve in early and intermediate periods after lockdown.", "The separate analysis in patients aged 18.0–25.9 years showed that young adult patients in this age range had a slightly different behavior in CGM metrics than older adults, supporting the differences highlighted in the T1D Exchange study.26 Additionally, our data are in line also with two more recent studies performed in 55 and 207 adult patients with type 1 diabetes in Italy.14 15 Interestingly, the study by Capaldo et al showed an increased TIR during lockdown, together with a significant decrease of %CV due to lower TBR and TAR, mostly in young adults (<35 years old), men, and subjects using multiple daily insulin injections.15", "Considering that the lockdown may have led to severely different conditions in adults with T1D, depending on working activities, physical activity, and potential consequences related to perceived stress, we attempted to further stratify adult patients according to their glucose management by selecting TIR as measurement of adequate glucose control and SDglu as a parameter of glucose variability.", "Furthermore, we reached all our patients by phone within 2 weeks after the study period to draw important information on the concomitant conditions that may have influenced the management of T1D, as data on physical activity and perceived stress with validated questionnaires.", "The clustering analysis allowed us to identify a group of patients who improved TIR and glucose variability (one-fourth of the patients) and two groups of patients who did not show significant changes in TIR but differed for SDglu, which was improved in half of the patients and worsened in the remaining one-fourth of the subjects.", "The analysis of those three groups revealed a prevalent positive impact of higher levels of physical activity in the first group, whereas young age and lower glycated hemoglobin prelockdown were relevant characteristics of those with unchanged TIR and improved glucose variability.", "Notably, a higher perceived stress seemed to play a relevant role in the group of patients whose glucose variability worsened, even in the absence of changes in TIR between prelockdown and during lockdown.", "We can speculate that the perceived stress in this subgroup of patients might be related either to the general situation due to lockdown or to the knowledge of the potential increased risk of worse prognosis in case of COVID-19 infection.", "We proposed that the administration of PSS may be a simple tool to assess their psychological stress-related consequences due to lockdown, which may be helpful to select patients with T1D who may be at higher risk of having worsened glucose variability.", "Finally, we could not demonstrate an effect of working activity and type of employment, type of insulin treatment, and type of CGM device on glucose management in adult patients.", "The main limitation of our study was that we enrolled a very well-selected cohort of patients with T1D, that is, those under CGM monitoring and with sensor use of >70% during the study period.", "This is particularly true for the subgroup of teenagers whose mean glycated hemoglobin levels are better than those reported in the literature and consistent with those of motivated patients.25", "Therefore, those results may not be extended to all patients with T1D, whose glucose changes during lockdown should be addressed in targeted studies.", "Additionally, we did not investigate the food choices with structured interview, and we did not consider the socioeconomic status of the patients, which may have a relevance in glucose control.", "Finally, it must be acknowledged that data derived from the Dexcom CGM system are obtained automatically every 5 min, whereas those derived from the FreeStyle Libre system are obtained when the patient actively undergoes a scan.", "However, we believe that those differences did not affect significantly the results of the study after considering the number of scans per day of our patients wearing FreeStyle Libre.", "Nevertheless, both types of CGM are approved for insulin dosing are widely used and facilitate the monitoring of the TIR.18 Nonetheless, this is the first study providing data on glucose control in a wide spectrum of patients with T1D, ranging from children to adults.", "Moreover, we presented for the first time an analysis of potential lockdown-related factors that may have contributed to the changes in glucose-related parameters."]}

You announced a partnership with Livongo, and something with [Eli] Lilly [and Company]?", "Lilly had been announced earlier. We formalized a relationship with Lilly where we’ve been working for quite some time to develop interconnected devices with Lilly as they develop insulin delivery systems.", "They have pens that are going to have Bluetooth connection capability and they’re working on an insulin delivery system as well for themselves, and our CGM will be integrated into the software platforms that they built.", "So we’ll provide them CGM data and patients will be able to view CGM data on their apps.", "And the Livongo announcement, that’s a data relationship. You know Livongo has a coaching platform and they coach patients based on, right now, fingersticks.", "Our relationship with them is through our APIs. And what we will do is provide them data, and their coaches and analytics can go through the CGM data and see if there’s recommendations that they would offer patients based upon what they see there.", "We believe it will provide a much richer experience for those patients.", "Livongo’s interesting. They got a lot of press this year because of their IPO, and a lot of people are aware of the space they’re in who weren’t before.", "But on the hardware side, they’re not super sophisticated; it’s just a white-labeled glucometer that has been around for ages.", "So it’s interesting to see them connecting to parts of the industry where the technology is cutting edge, like Dexcom.", "We’re glad we’re connecting to them. We’ve certainly worked with and spoken to others. Onduo, Verily’s diabetes management platform, has been taking data from us to power their stuff forever.", "I presented some UnitedHealthcare data yesterday in my presentation whereby they’re working on developing diabetes data and metrics based on CGM data.", "And we’ve even done some of this stuff on our own. So we’re looking at every possible angle to grow our business and provide patients with what they want.", "If patients truly want a Livongo experience and their software is better than anything we can develop, then — look, they’re buying sensors, they’re using our sensors, it’s all good.", "And we have to look at what are we best at. What we’re best at is making great sensors and making sensors that are safe and sensors that are accurate.", "And we’re good at the app we’ve created and the stuff we’ve done.", "But if somebody wants to make a sensor for some completely different use in a market they understand better than us, why not serve up our sensor data to them and let them put it in that platform?", "I’ve been talking to several folks in the diabetes space the last couple days here at JPM about how incredibly fast the space has moved in the past five years.", "It’s moved incredibly fast in the past five years.

And once that happened, all these avenues are open because you now have data that can go from a body to a server that’s real medical data.", "One of our board members said something really interesting. I’m a doctor, I’ve been at this forever, but CGM really is what personalized medicine was supposed to be when we started way back when.", "And this is where you have an opportunity to create personalized medicine for people with actionable information out of this data.", "Watching you guys, Abbott, Medtronic and Senseonics to some extent — there’s something of a market share race going on, right?", "Let’s take a step back. We’ve grown remarkably over the last couple years. We’re over 40% growth, compounded every year since 2010.", "So our growth trajectory has been nothing short of remarkable. Our strategy has been to make our product very much fit within the Type 1 market for insulin-using patients and to seek reimbursement.", "We’ve not rolled out highly-expensive cash pay platforms or gone the commercial route that many of our competitors have at this point in time.", "I think over the next several years you’ll see us move that way. They have grabbed a bunch of patients in Europe, but our Europe business is growing nicely too.", "And you do have a well-known brand and a relationship with patients.", "We do! And if we do something wrong, they’re also very happy to let us know. It’s OK.", "What does 2020 look like for you? What are you excited about?", "The first thing we’re excited about is we’re going to double our G6, our current product manufacturing capacity, again this year.", "We have been capacity-constrained ever since we launched that product. So we’ve not been able to go do some of the aggressive commercial things that we would have liked to have done as far as getting word out to more people.", "Has that bottleneck been on the manufacturing side?", "It has — not only with us, but with our component suppliers. So we’re beefing up our supply chain as well as our internal stuff.", "We do have a big G7 year planned. We’ve finalized our product configuration and we’re down pretty much to the end on that where we should be.", "We’ll start our clinical studies and execute those.", "But our 2020 launch is going to be a limited launch; it’s not going to be a big launch. If we’ve learned one lesson from the G6 platform, it’s that we can’t possibly launch this product when we’re not ready to produce tens of millions of them.", "With G6 we got an early approval and rather than wait until we’d built up a bunch of inventory we rolled it out.", "And we’ve been running out of product every month ever since, pretty much. We’re not going to do that again.", "When we get G7 approved, what we’re going to do is we’re going to build up inventory and when we launch it we’ll turn on the faucet and have availability across the board.", "So that’s more of a 2021 event rather than a 2020 event.", "What’s the big leap from G6 to G7, especially in terms of patient experience?", "The first thing they get is size. The G7, it’s smaller than a [Freestyle] Libre. It is probably in diameter a little smaller than a quarter, a little bigger than a nickel, and it doesn’t sit up very high.", "It is very easy to use — it’s literally a two-step insertion.", "We’re working on a longer-labeled application, 14 or 15 days. That length of wear will be determined by the accuracy of the data.", "Our current product is a 10-day standard. So we’ll see. That’s currently the plan of record to get it out that far.", "It’s just a different experience for our patients. Right now for example we have a transmitter that pops in, so you have to buy a transmitter and a sensor.", "No more transmitters. It’s one thing, you peel it off, you pop it in. You don’t have to put anything together.", "Does it have a separate receiver or go straight to the phone?", "We will offer a separate receiver because there are patients who don’t want to go to the phone. But we’ll also have it go straight to the phone.", "Getting smaller, lasting longer, getting more accurate — is that where this space is now? Is it almost like phones, just a bigger camera, or are there still paradigm-shifting changes to come?", "That is such a wonderful question. I’m glad you asked me that. I think, based on the performance of our sensor, while we are very good there are things we could do better.", "But we’re quite a ways down the path. The things we can make better going forward are very well-known to us; they’re very well-known to our patients.", "You want to eliminate anything that’s an outlier. Our algorithm is designed to pick up outliers and shut them down, but there may be an occasional one where it doesn’t.", "So if you could eliminate the big negative experience that’s a good thing.", "Certainly, improving experience within various ranges and on various days — these [challenges] are small compared to the problems we’re used to solving.", "The G7 is a very small physical footprint, I don’t know that we need to go much smaller than that. What’s going to be interesting going forward is this becomes a software and a data thing.", "This becomes about providing the patient with the experience they want.", "So for example, I had somebody in earlier who has two daughters with Type 1 diabetes. His vision of what he wants and what his daughters want is a CGM that connects with pumps, connects with phones, that has all this science and algorithms so his daughters never have to do anything, so they have a fully-automated insulin delivery system.", "Our Tandem Control IQ joint product that came out late last year is a step along that path.", "There are patients who want that and we need to offer a product that will meet those needs nicely. There are others who don’t.", "There are others who are going to want a pen that’s connected to an app and maybe manage that way. ...", "But if we can create an experience whereby we can, in a very thoughtful way, meet the needs of all patients, I don’t think that’s 10 software iterations [away], but I don’t think it’s one either.", "When we talk about paradigm shifts, I have to ask: Is noninvasive a pipe dream?", "With any technology I ask another question first: What does invasive mean? Invasive, the way people define it, means they’re afraid of needles.", "So I want you to think of something. I’m wearing a G7 on my arm right now. Just touch that. Is there anything invasive about that?", "So when they’re solving the invasive problem, they’re not really solving a problem, because a needle puts a sensor in you but that sensor is the width of a hair, it goes in on a very shallow basis, it doesn’t hurt.", "So what are you solving by creating a noninvasive platform unless you get wild accuracy?", "There are three problems to solve in sensors: If you can make it perform better than the other guys, or as good; if you make it more convenient; and if you significantly reduce the cost.", "So if one of those three things happen and you can maintain the other two, you have a product offering.", "I’ve never seen anything on the noninvasive side that meets the performance standards. It may be low cost if you’ve got it reading from your watch, but if it doesn’t achieve performance it doesn’t matter.", "We look at all of them. We’re not blind to them, but we haven’t seen them make a difference. And if one of them did?", "Quite candidly, we’d look real hard at making it part of our product family because we’re not going to give the space up easily.", "I had another question about moving into the Type 2 market — is that a clinically motivated thing or is it more of a business move?", "People with Type 2 diabetes are diagnosed and they’re given a pill and told \"walk more, eat less and take this.\"", "And over time they get worse and worse and worse, and by the time you intervene sometimes it’s even too late.", "You learn more from one sensor session than you ever learn from any of these fingersticks, and when these patients are provided with information they do incredibly well.", "We saw in my presentation yesterday the improvement in the program at UnitedHealth Group, how much better a patient was after going through their program.", "Average glucose values, glucose spikes, everything goes down.", "We saw another pilot from Intermountain Healthcare where they just took a small group of 100 patients — 50 on the CGM full time, 50 on meters.", "They believe the annual cost savings in the CGM was $5,000 a year per patient, based on hospitalizations, lab tests, drug costs, doctor visits, phone calls.", "Look, we’d be disingenuous to say everything isn’t business-motivated, because it is. We’re a company.", "But we look at a Type 2 population around the country that’s much larger than the Type 1 population and the interaction with those people is more recommendation, it’s more education, it’s more diagnostic.", "Versus in our Type 1 and our Type 2 intensive insulin populations, it’s fully integrated into drug delivery and dosing a drug.", "Look at the Type 2 drugs that are out. Next time you go home and watch television, there are more ads for Type 2 diabetes drugs than any drug out on the market.", "They spend a fortune on Type 2 diabetes drug advertising — Novo, Lilly, Novartis, everybody. Their Type 2 drugs are everywhere because this condition is so rampant and people are afraid of getting on insulin, but we don’t know when the right time to put a patient on insulin is.", "Well, you learn that by putting on a CGM [and tracking their condition]. When the drugs don’t work anymore, it’s time to make a change.", "Or if they don’t work anymore because you’re eating horribly or you’re not exercising, you need to try this or we’re going to move you to insulin.", "So there’s a diagnostic element here, but there’s also an element where the patients just do better. It becomes a question of getting reimbursement and getting a product and a payment [model] whereby payers will pay for it.", "We have found in all of our experiences all over the world that when our product is reimbursed we do fabulously well.", "Unless it’s extremely inexpensive, cash pay to have a consistent market is hard. So we’ve got to develop our dataset and we’ll continue to work with all of these companies, with the insurance companies, with Onduo, with Livongo.", "We’ve got multiple irons in the fire and we’ll figure it out. For us the important thing is that they all wear Dexcom sensors.", "We haven’t talked much about all the things we accoplished last year. $1.47 billion off a billion-dollar year.", "That type of organic growth you just don’t see. And that kind of organic growth given all the things — if you’ve listened to all our earning calls you’ve heard all the statements we’ve made about what a struggle it was for us to have enough manufacturing capacity.", "Scaling this technology is not simple. Yes, everyone’s trying to get here, but the sheer capital it takes and the money; … it’s easy to build 10,000 sensors.", "It’s not easy to build 20 million. So we’ve learned and we’ve had these inflection points and this year was another one.", "I think we’re positioned to do good things in 2020 and beyond.", "That’s what you call a \"good problem,\" right? Everyone wants your product but you can’t make it fast enough?", "You know, people say that to me all the time, but I think with our device it’s the most horrible problem you can possibly imagine.", "Because with our device, our patients’ very lives depend on it and when they have to wait seven days for the next one, I don’t have an answer.", "So, it is a good problem if you’re in the car business. It’s a good problem if you’re selling iPhones.", "It’s not a good problem if someone needs your sensors or they’re going to die, so I don’t want that problem any more ever again."]}

Most of the legal barriers, because of technology available when they were written, are oriented toward the electronic protection and privacy of patient information held in health care databases.", "Yang and Silverman [ ] warn that when software is voluntarily downloaded and installed (as an app), accessing data from that app about the user may not be considered “unauthorized” as it is sometimes wrongly assumed under the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act of 1986.", "In fact, they even conclude the Electronic Communications Privacy Act “probably does not protect against the access or acquisition of data by the developer of a private app”", "(p. 224).Most users (and uses) do not demand high computational performance of mobile phones, but it is likely that this demand will escalate with the user-facing capabilities of the health-related apps.", "Consequently, types of health services that can be offered via these platforms are increasing in number and sophistication.", "Referring again to the 2015 State of the Connected Patient report [", "]: 63% of Millennials would be interested proactively providing their health data from Wi-Fi or wearable devices to their doctor or provider so they can monitor their well-being and 71% would be interested in a doctor giving them a mobile app to actively manage their well-being for preventative care.", "Such interests require demands going beyond simple local data capture and reporting (eg, “fitness” apps), but more sophisticated data acquisition and processing coupled with sufficient analytical and communication capabilities.", "Finally, it is worth noting that an IMS Institute reports that despite the 100,000+ of health apps, just 36 apps accounted for almost 50% of the downloads (ignoring use), and 40% of the apps had less than 5000 downloads [ ].Core", "The third characteristic of mobile phone technology is the ability to access the Internet or World Wide Web via mobile broadband.", "It is not sufficient that devices are portable, powerful, and capable to run the appropriate apps, but it is often the case that they must also be able to communicate via rapid Internet pathways.", "The technological sophistication or maturity of a region (defining its capabilities) is determined by the particular mix of its mobile technologies [", "]. Note that the term “wireless broadband” should generally not be used in place of “mobile broadband” (or mobile cellular broadband) as wireless broadband can include fixed-wireless and satellite technologies, although some satellite broadband technologies can be mobile.", "The ITU generally defines mobile broadband as download data speeds of at least 256 Kbit/s using the Internet protocol and access to the “greater Internet” (ie, World Wide Web) via the Hypertext Transfer Protocol, but solely having standard short messaging service (SMS) does not count as broadband as it is a mobile-based voice protocol and does not require Internet access", "]. Mobile broadband is also defined in terms of technological generations (G), where 2G, 2.5G, 2.75G (1990s) technologies were the first digital cellular networks with speeds in the ITU range just noted and represents an earlier 2011 definition yielding 90% world coverage [ ].", "As with any evolving technology, definitions must change as the categorical characteristics of the technology change [ , ], so it is important to understand the operating definition of mobile broadband being used, and whether the reported statistics refer to overall capacity (eg, gigabit levels attributed to 802.11ac) or actual expected delivery rates for individuals under operational conditions and distance.", "In particular, many definitions specify or assume at least 3G technologies [ ], with Long Term Evolution and Long Term Evolution-Advanced being the current fastest widely deployed mobile broadband technologies in terms of overall capacities and the closest to becoming the global base standard (there are different deployment forms) for mobile broadband [ ].", "In addition, intermediate steps taking advantage of current standards have yielded niche standards such as WiGig (802.11ad), which is a very fast (7 gigabits per sec, low latency), but short range (1-7 m) designed for close connectivity, such as eliminating cables [ ].", "On the other hand, the forthcoming next-generation 802.11ax wireless specification is not only seeking increases in network capacity but also seeking to create larger “data pipes” to individual devices, thus radically increasing not only the network capacity but also the average data rates to individual devices [ ].When considering newer baseline definition of mobile broadband subscriptions (at least 3G networks), the ITU of the United Nations estimates that 47.2 per 100 inhabitants of the world’s population is to be subscribed in 2015, with 89% of the world urban population (4 billion) covered but only 29% of the rural population (3.4 billion) covered, but substantial distributional differences between the developed countries (86.7 per 100 inhabitants), developing countries (39.2 per 100 inhabitants), and the least developed countries (12.1 per 100 inhabitants), where Africa is the sole region where mobile broadband is below 20 per 100 inhabitants (though within-regional differences occur)", "]. However, comparisons are complex as there is still a great deal of variation in how “mobile broadband” is defined, how specific technologies are classified, and how measurements are conducted [ ].", "Regardless, Ericsson predicts that by 2021, 85% of all smartphone subscriptions will be for mobile broadband, but whether it plays a replacement role for fixed broadband or a complementary role depends on the particular segment [ ].It is important to understand how these characteristics map to target populations.", "For example, there are distinct issues with the lack of rural broadband (wired or wireless or mobile) in the United States, where 53% of rural Americans (22 million people) lack such access, as do almost two-third of US territories and Tribal lands [", "]. A 2015 Pew survey found that 54% of sampled African American homes had broadband, a decline from 2013, and this percent varied by household income, ranging from a low of 41% (income < $29K) to a high of 80% ($50K ≤ income ≤ $75K) [ ].", "The same survey showed that almost 20% of African American households have smartphones, but no broadband.", "There is an emerging trend of smartphone dependence among younger adults, nonwhites, lower income, and lower educational attainment, where these devices are the sole mechanism for both Web-based access (often at slow speeds) and phone calls (elimination of land lines) for communication, but also are less likely to be covered by health insurance or have a bank account", "]. The decline of landlines in the United States was further evidenced by a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention survey that estimated 47.1% of children and 39.1% of adults live in wireless-only households, with 56.2% of poor households and 53.1% of Hispanic households were wireless-only [ ].", "Two consequences of decline in landline use, sometimes overlooked, are (1) the loss of community revenue typically accrued by local telecommunication taxes, as federal law prohibits state and local taxation of Internet data, including communication apps such as Skype, FaceTime, WhatsApp, and Twitter [ ] and (2) potential bias in “phone-based” surveys reliant on landline registers [ , ].The penetration of mobile broadband worldwide is expected to surpass fixed-broadband by 2017 [", "]. In fact, the 34 member countries of the Organization for Cooperation and Economic Development now report an average of 81.3% mobile broadband penetration (wireless subscriptions per inhabitant), with 7 members averaging above the 100% mark [ ].", "Collectively the Organization for Cooperation and Economic Development member countries’ population is approximately 1 billion people, and the results necessarily do not include data from other important regions, as Africa, India, Brazil, China, and Russia.", "For example, in the least developed countries, fixed-broadband remains less than 1% and escalation to mobile broadband is the sole option [ ].Regarding health care, mobile broadband is essential for accessing the Internet resources and supporting the sufficient bandwidth for communication capabilities of data-intensive mobile phone app, such as video, without the need for, or reliance on, geospecific landlines.", "For example, the Mobile MIM iOS app allowing viewing X-rays, ultrasounds, neuroimaging on iPads, or iPhones by medical professionals, but developers also provide VueMe iOS apps for secure patients to view and discuss images with their health providers without physical presence required [", "].Despite the increasing capabilities of mobile phones, attached devices offer another route to point-of-care accessibility via mobile technology, allowing local complex data acquisition (via the combined capability of the attached device and the mobile phone) by a health care professional.", "The MobiUS SP1 mobile phone app interacts with a hand-held ultrasound device, allowing local scanning and transfer of imaging via Wi-Fi, cellular or USB to PC connection [", "]. Dexcom’s Apple Watch app displays patterns of glucose readings. It receives data from Dexcom’s Continuous Glucose Monitoring system that captures glucose levels by a subcutaneous sensor, up to 288 readings per day, and relaying the information (and any warnings) to up to five additional “followers” [ ].", "The AliveECG app (with the attached device) allows individuals to take their own ECG with their Android or iOS smartphone (or tablet), which then analyzes the data to determine if atrial fibrillation (a leading cause of stroke) is detected [ ].", "Proteus Digital Health has both an ingestible sensor-enabled pill that works with an external patch that detects a signal that is generated from the pill when ingested (reaches the stomach) and records rest or activity patterns (steps, heart rate) that are sent via Bluetooth to the caregiver’s, patient’s, or physician’s mobile phone app, as well as to a secure database accessible by authorized health care professionals [ ].", "Propeller Health’s sensor attaches to most asthma and COPD inhalers, capturing time and geolocation data of use (and other data, such as user-supplied medications), linking to an app that can share that data with health care partners or anonymously (eg, capturing timing and location data across users signaling environmental situations), but the app also provides information on adherence and education [ ].", "Medronic’s MiniMed system connects its small insulin pump and continuous glucose monitor to a diabetics iPhone, sending pump and sensor information to the iPhone every 5 minutes, and sending history information to their CareLink health care “partners” every 24 hours, or preset text messages immediately if glucose levels exceed tolerance levels [ ].", "In addition, Medtronic is also partnering with Samsung to develop Android apps for that device series [ ].All of the previously noted devices are examples that have been approved, or are being reviewed for approval, by the US Food and Drug Administration at the time of this writing, which speaks to the separate topic of how smartphone technology (directly or indirectly) takes on the role of a regulated medical device [", "]. But Internet connectivity is an ever-emerging architecture. Every smartphone can act as a wireless hotspot affording a gateway for other smartphones or computers or attached devices.", "To complicate things, Bluetooth 4.2 allows devices to securely connect to each other and to the Internet via IPv6/6LoWPAN (IPv6 over Low-Power Wireless Personal Area Networks) via direct connection to any gateway device (eg, a router) and avoid the necessity of a smartphone entirely, thus opening the communication door for the “Internet of Things”—sensors, instruments, devices, and attachments that have the capability of interacting directly with the Internet [ ].Core", "The final characteristic of mobile phone technology is that mobile phones are usually tethered to individuals, though the validity of this characteristic is dependent on the heterogeneity of the penetration of this technology in certain populations.", "With respect to penetration, consider that mobile phone technology differs critically from landlines on this metric because mobile phones are associated with individuals and not residences (requiring a permanent, physical location), so there is usually a 1:1 mapping between individuals and mobile phone use (but this mapping can also be 1:N, when individual users have more than one mobile phone account per SIM card).", "In addition, a US Gallup Panel in July 2015 revealed that on the average 11% checked their mobile phone devices every few minutes (22% of those between the ages of 18 and 29 years), and an addition average of 41% reported checking a few times an hour (51% of those between the ages of 18-29)", "]. Nevertheless, the assumption of individual tethering is likely a valid default assumption sans conflicting evidence.", "At a basic level, this affords an efficient technological mechanism for 2 health purposes: data monitoring-acquisition and intervention delivery.", "Regarding the former, individual tethering allows “immediate” acquisition of personal event data, actively or passively.", "For example, various types of experience sampling or ecological momentary assessment methods have emerged to capture individuals’ self-reporting episodic descriptions (event based, time based) of behaviors and experiences in “real time” (ie, to avoid delayed, retrospective autobiographic approaches that may be biased in recall or inaccurately reported) in real-world contexts, such as diaries (paper or electronic), telephone calls, generally emerging in the 1990s", "- ]. Mobile phones are now serving as a natural platform for applying such data acquisition approaches for conditions as tobacco use [ ], alcohol use [ ], development of virtues [ ], mood and affect assessment [ ], diet and physical activity [ ], and obesity-specific contexts [ ], with additional activity sensor capabilities that serve to augment “message-based” data for such approaches [ ].Individual tethering accordingly supports personalized medicine or public health interventions as allowing for specific messages to be sent to specific individuals.", "In general, individually-tailored messages in public health interventions are more likely (when properly designed) to effect behavior change than generic messages [", "]. Although the particular definition of “tailoring” in public health and health care has varied widely [ , ], our interpretation simply addresses the fundamental characteristic of what the technology can deliver—connectivity tethered to an individual.", "How any form of tailoring will be used (and its likely impact will be) exploiting that characteristic depends on the quality of the design in the context of an intervention.", "For example, linking an ecological momentary assessment method with an intervention treatment to support individually-tailored SMS connectivity [ ], but use of other forms of tailoring exploiting the tethered nature of mobile phones are being developed, such as with human immunodeficiency virus adherence [ ], but is a growing component of many SMS intervention designs [ ].", "Again, the tethered technology affords various types of tailoring, but the impact of any tailoring depends on the quality of the design and its implementation.", "Of course, the 1:1 mapping also allows for large amounts of (and of potentially high fidelity) patient-generated health data, aggregated for location and time-dependent analyses at a group level, such as disease surveillance or clinical practice statistics [ , ].A", "question regarding tethering involves not only the generation of individual’s data but also one of access to individual’s EHR.", "] demonstrates how both physicians’ and health consumers’ attitudes and behaviors regarding digital technology and health have changed in 2 years, for example, in patient’s actual access their electronic records (2014: 27%, 2016: 45%), in what data they have access to in their EHR (2014: 39%, 2016: 65%), and in the use of health apps (2014: 16%, 2016: 33%).", "However, the same survey revealed that 92% of patients believed that they should have full access to their EHR, whereas only 18% of physicians held that same belief.", "This is one example of gaps that may exist between 2 of the key stakeholders with respect to use of this technology: patients and their health care providers.", "Of course, the world is often more complex and dynamic than we either describe or anticipate. Collectively, interactions and secondary impacts of these characteristics are beginning to emerge.", "For example, the problem of individuals’ “access to access” (ie, availability of technology that enables access to health services) is evaporating.", "As the penetration of smartphone into all populations continues, it affords an important vehicle for recruitment of under-represented groups in clinical trials and other health-related research [", "]. But as technology forms become more effective and efficient, so do mHealth offerings, and this usually results in differential access (eg, via cost) to the “best” mHealth solutions [ ].Mobile", "phone–based apps allow the localization of data acquisition, processing, and presentation or response options to specific individuals, situations, and context.", "Access to the Internet or World Wide Web increases the amount and forms of data gathered and transmitted to and from individuals and groups, over time and across place.", "Consequently, mHealth for health care has generated many variations of technological use, ranging from the ability to generate tailored messages to individuals or to groups of individuals with similar needs via the Web [", "] or via text messages [ ], to engaging technological combinations such as those being designed in broad, social media systems [ ] affording “peer-to-peer” health care [ ] or to realizing new health surveillance capabilities through extant technology and relevant populations, such as “participatory epidemiology” forms of engagement and rapid communication [ - ].The rise of inter-connectivity of local health-rated devices will not only increase the potential of mHealth but also increase the complexity of its design.", "The nature of “wearable” health devices are currently worn either on the wrist (55%) or the chest (27%) or the purse or pocket or shoe (17%), but are also appearing on the arm (8%), head (7%) clothing (6%) leg or ear (5%), ankle (3%), necklace (3%), or finger (1%)", "] and are highly dependent on sensors [ ].

In fact, Price-Waterhouse-Coopers placed “Do-it-yourself healthcare” as their top health industry issue for 2015 [ ] and places “care in the palm of your hand” as the third top industry issue for 2016 [ ].", "However, this may speak less about preference of care and more about ease of access. Given the opportunities for engaging mHealth apps for public health, it is necessary to understand the broad array of interconnection forces at play, now and likely in the future.", "This is a distinctly different patient-facing functionality than the failed Google Health’s medical records or health data platform [ ] offering various forms of disintermediating from “traditional” health care reimbursement, face-to-face models, but it is difficult to predict how the insurance industry or federal or state regulators will respond.", "What is clear is that the upcoming Stage 3 requirement of the Meaningful Use incentive program from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services strongly encourages patient engagement (care management, wellness, and patient supplied data) outside of a clinic using mobile health apps, coordination of care, and patient access to health information via mobile platforms", "]. Recall that Apple’s HealthKit integrates with the Epic System’s EHR system. Consider that one of the primary reasons for HealthKit’s growing adoption in health systems is the fundamental simplicity of connecting to institutional EHR systems [ ], and the top EHR vendor meeting the Meaningful Use requirement is Epic [ ].", "Note also that Duke Medicine recently succeeded in being the first Epic-based health system to implement the Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources standard with Apple’s HealthKit [ ], a standard that also allows Epic Systems EHR data to interoperate with IBM’s Watson Health analytics [ ].", "Overall, the adoption of even basic EHR by the key gatekeepers, the physicians, is occluded by the encountered difficulties of data exchange, whether it involves interoperability standards or strategic moves by vendors to gain competitive advantage [ ].", "Nevertheless, specific inroads work to demonstrate ways of overcoming such obstacles for specific health objectives on mobile apps [ - ].Conclusion", "mHealth is an ill-defined, but growing component of all aspects of health (prevention, diagnosis, treatment, research) around the world.", "We focused on 4 core characteristics of the foundational platform, the mobile smartphone, that will likely remain as important to understand to help design and implement more effective and efficient mHealth solutions.", "More importantly, as each characteristic has surprising depth, complexity, and relation to the other characteristics, it is essential to discern how these work together in any particular mHealth context.", "Each type of characteristic embodies both features and constraints.", "This is the fastest spreading communication technology. The first core characteristic—penetration into populations—is possible because mobile telephony is becoming ubiquitous, and this has significant implications for reach into populations, although not homogenously in many cases.", "Therefore, is necessary to know the technological platform most adopted and how it is used by the target population or subgroup.", "Apps are powerful but issues of use are complicated. The second core characteristic—the availability of app — affords potentially sophisticated function (and computation) available to the device, depending on the type of mobile phone.", "In addition, the growth of short-range device connectivity allows ancillary devices to be connected to the mobile phone, enlarging the set of technological options in communication, monitoring, and delivery of health solutions.", "In addition, both the sophistication of sensors on, or connected to, a mobile phone raises the question of whether it is (they are) a medical device (in a legal sense) and how HIPAA rules guide the storage and use of that data.", "Given the immense growth in apps, competition can be intense, but opportunities for innovation are practically unbounded.", "Connectivity matters. The third characteristic—wireless broadband—is the most rapidly growing technological platform for Internet access, so consideration of mHealth contexts with Internet connectivity, even intermittent connectivity, affords a substantially different pathway for expected data rates to and from devices, influencing the formation and functionality of mHealth apps and their target groups.", "However, as lower income groups increase their (often sole) reliance on mobile broadband for Internet connectivity, data charges can escalate rapidly.", "Costs to the client are still a part of the use equation.", "Almost everybody has a mobile phone. The fourth characteristic—that mobile phones are generally tethered to individuals—affords direct access to individuals allowing deep penetration to the individual level, with apps being tailored to individuals and having the ability to adapt to individual behaviors and physiological data, captured and communicated distally (if necessary) in real time.", "The primary interpretation of the 4 characteristics is that they serve as both opportunities and constraints.", "However, to exploit them as either, it is essential to understand what they are, and how they relate to one’s specific mHealth context.", "Regardless, they are the enduring characteristics common to all mHealth mobile phone apps.", "Recently Gordon Moore (the architect of Moore’s Law) stated, We’ve just seen the beginning of what computers are going to do for us", "]. The ubiquity of the devices, their computational ability, and their ability to capture and rapidly transmit complex data, whether the data comes from “medical devices (Food and Drug Administration approved) or not, the rate and amount of data captured lends itself to large-scale analytics affording new, broader capabilities” [ ] which, of course, can be used for “good or evil” [ ].", "Along with “Big Data” often comes “Big Noise,” so the merging of technology and health contexts will allow us the opportunity to move from collecting data, which has a cost (eg, acquisition, storage, transfer, security, integrity), to efficiently extracting information, which as a value by guiding decisions that lead to health improvements in individuals, groups, and societies.", "The key is achieving the economically-viable potential to turn acquired data into information that can be applied to the betterment of health, which necessitates not only well-designed interventions but also well-designed evaluations of those interventions [ ].", "Yet, there is likely another level where health care, and public health, use that information to inform policies that are enabled, and not blocked, by institutional mechanisms.", "Still the fundamental mantra remains: mHealth is not about technology; it is about how technology is appropriately used in the context of achieving specific health goals [ , ].", "Nevertheless, future discussions must include additional considerations of how to weave the use and usability of such technology into the foundational designs of interventions, and not simply a delivery platform afterthought, as technology is not neutral.", "Translating evidence-based interventions for one mode in which it was designed (eg, workshops) cannot be adopted for another mode without determining the impact on the integrity of the original logic [ , ].Mobile", "phone and communication technologies afford us characteristics with remarkable capabilities and potential.", "And these are rapidly, unpredictably, and even disruptively, changing and changing health care and public health.", "This work was funded in part by a grant from Emory University’s Global Health Institute and the Goizueta Business School Summer Research Fund at Emory University.", "- WHO.
