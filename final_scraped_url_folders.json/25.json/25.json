Accordingly, the aim of this study was to quantify the ease of EHR ordering of specified high-value and low-value services.", "From April to June 2018, a survey was sent to medical institutions to identify a sample of EHR systems.", "Prior to the survey being sent, the study was approved for institutional review board (IRB) exemption by the Michigan Medicine institutional IRB.", "Respondents who agreed to participate in the study were sent a standardized form that listed 5 high-value and 5 low-value services that would be frequently ordered in an outpatient primary care setting.", "Rationale for their inclusion was derived from published national guidelines (Table9-19).

Of the 5 easiest services to order, 2 were designated high value (flu shot [9.0 clicks], A1C testing [9.8 clicks]) and 3 were deemed low value (prostate-specific antigen screening [10.0 clicks], vitamin D screening [10.2 clicks], lumbar x-ray for back pain", "[11.2 clicks]).

First, to a POSA beginning with claim 45 of the '301 patent, it would not have been obvious to place an unsubstituted benzyl at R. Most of the pre-1996 experimentation relating to FAAs was performed at the R3 position.", "(See FF 73-74) As a result, at the critical date, March 1996, there was relatively little data on which a POSA could draw to form reasonable expectations about the impact of placing an unsubstituted benzyl at R.", "The Federal Circuit has emphasized that \"predictability is a vital consideration in the obviousness analysis,\" including obviousness-type double patenting.", "Otsuka, 678 F.3d at 1298 (citing KSR, 550 U.S. at 421).

In 1987, Dr. Kohn published a paper demonstrating that a compound with a fluoro-substituted benzyl at R had similar anticonvulsant activity to an analogous compound with an unsubstituted benzyl, but with a substantial improvement in neurotoxicity levels.", "(See Roush Tr. at 616; JTX-7 at DEF_566 Tbl.6) These results were confirmed in Kohn's 1990 paper, which showed that in certain FAAs, structures with various fluoro-substituted benzyls yielded a \"far superior\" protective index while maintaining a comparable anticonvulsant effect (relative to the same compound with an unsubstituted benzyl).", "(See Kohn Tr. at 396, 489 (explaining that replacing unsubstituted benzyl with fluoro-substituted benzyl yielded \"an improvement in the overall protective index resulting from a decrease in neurotoxicity of the compound\"); JTX-11 at Tbl.2, DEF_272)", "The data from some of these experiments were also included in the '729 patent.

Paruszewski and Hinko does not qualify as prior art. Nevertheless, their exploration is relevant because it shows what a POSA would have thought at around the priority date.", "Specifically, it is probative of the fact that the benefits of lacosamide (including the placement of a benzyl at R and a methyl at R1) were not apparent until well after the priority date of the '551 patent.", "In sum, the placement of unsubstituted benzyl at the R position in claim 9 of the '551 patent is patentably distinct from the millions of possible groups that could be placed at the R position in claim 45 of the '301 patent.", "Likewise, it would also not have been obvious for a POSA starting with claim 45 of the '301 patent to place an unsubstituted methyl at R1.", "As with the situation that confronted a POSA considering what to place at R, and as noted above, a POSA deciding what to place at R1 had little data upon which to draw as to the impact of placing an unsubstituted methyl at R1.", "(See Roush Tr. at 646) Hence, again, the unpredictability of drug development means that the lack of data concerning R1 is a strong reason why the selection of an unsubstituted methyl would not have been obvious to a POSA in March 1996.", "The Court's conclusion with respect to R1 is also supported by research conducted by others working on FAAs at the same time as Dr. Kohn.", "Dr. Hinko modified the FAA structure to change the way the structure at R1 connected with the rest of the molecule.", "(See Roush Tr. at 614; JTX-87 at Tbl.1) Dr. Paruszewski explored a similar change by removing the carbonyl group (C==O) to which the R1 group is attached.", "The Court accords less weight to the evidence of what Drs. Hinko and Paruszewski did at R1 than it does with respect to what these same scientists did at R, due to the Court's assumption that for double patenting a POSA would effectively \"lock in\" all that is common between claim 45 of the '301 patent and claim 9 of the '551 patent.", "From this assumption it would seem to follow that, for purposes of the double patenting analysis, the general structure of the FAA of claim 45 of the '301 patent would be preserved, meaning that the Court should not consider the alterations made by Drs.", "Hinko and Paruszewski. When this assumption is removed - because it is an incorrect assumption for double patenting, and/or at the general obviousness analysis - the weight given to this evidence increases substantially.", "Defendants contend that scientists were deterred from using an unsubstituted benzyl at R and an unsubstituted methyl at R1 due to Plaintiffs' \"blocking patent\" rights.", "Viewed in light of all of the evidence, this argument is not persuasive. The record lacks clear and convincing evidence that the patents were the reason Drs.", "Hinko and Paruszewski did not fill in R and R1 with the structures required to arrive at lacosamide. Instead, given the evidence before the Court, it appears that these other scientists did not do so because it was not obvious to do so.", "Furthermore, the Court is not persuaded that Plaintiffs' patents were \"blocking patents,\" as explained in connection with commercial success below (see infra).", "Defendants point out that Dr. Kohn's limited experimentation with the R1 position was substantially less promising than his experimentation with the R position, meaning - in Defendants' view - that a POSA would have been less motivated to alter the unsubstituted methyl Dr. Kohn often used at R1.", "At the R position, there were many structures that performed comparably to - and, in some ways, better than - unsubstituted benzyl.", "(FF 89, 93) In contrast, Dr. Kohn found that none of the modifications he made at the R1 position showed as good activity as the unsubstituted methyl.", "(See Kohn Tr. at 468-69) While this fact arguably means that a POSA would have been more likely to have placed an unsubstituted methyl at R1 than to have placed an unsubstituted benzyl at R, the lack of data, in tandem with the fact that other scientists responded to Dr. Kohn's work by modifying the FAA structure in different ways, supports the Court's conclusions that it would not have been obvious to place an unsubstituted methyl at R1.", "In sum, the placement of an unsubstituted methyl at the R1 position in claim 9 of the '551 patent is patentably distinct from the large number of structures that could be placed at the R1 position in claim 45 of the '301 patent.", "The Court has considered all of Defendants' arguments for a contrary conclusion and finds them unavailing.", "Defendants emphasize that the '729 patent disclosed that benzyl is \"especially preferred\" for placement at the R position.", "(See FF 118-119; D.I. 263 at 8) Similarly, the '729 patent expresses a preference for unsubstituted methyl at R1.", "(FF 119) While Defendants are correct, the double patenting analysis requires a POSA to start with the '301 patent's claim 45, not with the '729 patent.", "Moreover, in light of the totality of evidence in the record - which includes the lack of data showing the effect of placing an unsubstituted benzyl at R, the lack of data showing the effect of placing an unsubstituted methyl at R1, and the data showing positive results from placing something other than an unsubstituted benzyl at R- it is only with impermissible hindsight that a POSA would have focused on the \"especially preferred\" language of the '729 patent's disclosure.", "Defendants further argue that Plaintiffs knew about lacosamide when they added genus claims 39-47 to the '301 patent.", "While this appears to be correct (compare FF 79-80 (showing that Dr. Kohn had synthesized and tested lacosamide by late 1994) with DTX-2016 (showing that genus claims of '301 patent were added in October 1995)), it does not impact the Court's analysis, which must focus on the hypothetical inquiry of what the POSA would have done - not what the real inventor actually did do.", "\"The inventor's own path itself never leads to a conclusion of obviousness; that is hindsight.

By 1996, nonaromatic compounds (like 31) were generally disfavored, as the bulk of the literature on FAAs showed that aromatic FAAs demonstrated better anticonvulsant activity.", "Defendants make this argument in one sentence of one footnote.

Apotex, Inc., 550 F.3d 1075, 1084 (Fed.

While other prior art did disclose such a preference, anticipation must be based on a single piece of prior art.", "To the extent Defendants' argument is actually one of obviousness, the Court has considered and rejected their obviousness defenses.", "Defendants refer the Court to a line of cases holding that a prior art disclosure of a small genus anticipates each member of that genus.", "(See OB at 18 (citing cases)) These cases do not help Defendants meet their burden to show anticipation here.", "Compound 107e is not a genus - it is a mixture containing two components. Lacosamide is not a \"species\" or instance of compound 107e.", "All that the LeGall Thesis discloses about compound 107e is that it \"may have\" good anticonvulsant activity, not that it does have good anticonvulsant activity.", "(See DTX-2019 at DEF_245; FF 112) This speculation - which is not supported by any actual data - is based on an analogy to compound 86b.", "(Roush Tr. at 602) LeGall tested compound 86b, and found that it was six times less active than furan, a heteroaromatic compound that was the most promising of the compounds disclosed by LeGall.", "In fact, as Defendants' expert, Dr. Pleasure, confirmed, LeGall disclosed no efficacy data, no toxicity data, and no pharmacological data of any kind for compound 107e.", "(Pleasure Tr. at 303) Nor, as Dr. Pleasure admitted, does LeGall even suggest that 107e may have good pharmacokinetic properties, good safety, or minimal drug interaction.", "(Pleasure Tr. at 304) Nor does the LeGall Thesis disclose the R enantiomer - and the characteristics of this enantiomer were unknown in March 1996.", "Further undermining Defendants' contentions is the fact that Lily was aware of compound 107e (see FF 169) and decided not to pursue it.", "Instead, consistent with the teaching of the LeGall Thesis, Lilly selected furan - a heteroaromatic, unlike 107e - as a lead compound to test.", "Accordingly, the Court concludes that claim 9 of the '551 patent is not invalid due to anticipation.", "Defendants contend that the claim term \"therapeutic composition\" is indefinite and, therefore, claim 10 of the '551 patent is invalid due to indefiniteness.", "\"[A] patent is invalid for indefiniteness if its claims, read in light of the specification . . . and the prosecution history, fail to inform, with reasonable certainty, those skilled in the art about the scope of the invention.\"", "During the claim construction process, the parties disputed the meaning of \"therapeutic composition.\"", "The Court adopted Plaintiffs' proposed construction, which was: \"A composition suitable for use as a treatment regimen over an extended period of time (chronic administration).\"", "(D.I. 240 at 5) In reaching this decision, the Court rejected Defendants' contention that Plaintiffs' construction would render claim 10 invalid for indefiniteness.", "Defendants' principal argument was that a POSA would not know \"exactly how long\" a period is required to constitute \"chronic administration.\"", "(Id. at 11) The Court held that \"Defendants ha[d] not presented clear and convincing evidence showing that claim 10 is indefinite.\"", "At trial, Defendants raised this issue again, now relying on the testimony of Dr. Pleasure.

The average cost for one party to participate in an IPR has been estimated at approximately $200,000.186 Indeed, the cost of challenging an issued patent from the USPTO is usually much greater than the cost of obtaining one in the first place.187 Further, the possible penalty of a loss—being barred from challenging the validity of the claims in the future—could prove consequential.188 Most petitioners may therefore be cautious and selective in choosing patents to challenge via an IPR.", "Commentators have also lauded the PTAB for its expertise and thoroughness. Each PTAB member is an experienced patent practitioner.189 Further, the USPTO attempts to have at least one Administrative Patent Judge on the panel with relevant technical expertise.", "In contrast, most federal district judges and jurors have not received a technical patent-related education and possess little, if any, experience in the patent law.", "As explained by one practitioner, if \"you read PTAB decisions in IPRs, you'll find that they're typically very thorough and well-reasoned, much better reasoned than district court opinions.\"190", "On the other hand, critics of IPRs assert that \"Congress erected a heavily slanted administrative regime that invalidates patents by design, even when those same patents would be upheld by district court.\"191", "These features reportedly include a more capacious claim construction, which renders patents more susceptible to a validity attack; a lower burden of proof upon the patent challenger than would be the case in district court litigation; and the absence of a jury and a \"disinterested, life-appointed judge.\"192", "They also note that the one-year deadline for completing an IPR may render patent proprietors \"ill-prepared for the speed of the fight,\" in contrast to the challenger who may \"methodically prepare a petition and set up a strategy for the proceedings\" in advance.193", "In addition, some patents have been subject to multiple, serial IPR petitions on different grounds of patent validity.194", "Some patent owners have been subject to dozens of IPR petitions since 2012.195 This possibility, which increases the cost and length of participation, may be exacerbated because current law permits one individual to file multiple IPR petitions against a single patent.196", "Statistics with respect to IPRs also suggest that most patents in these proceedings have been subject to contemporaneous litigation.", "In one recent study, three legal academics recently identified each of the 24,162 patent cases filed between September 16, 2011, and June 30, 2015.197 As they explain:", "During this time, a total of 14,218 patents were either challenged in an IPR or CBM petition, asserted in litigation, or both.", "A subset of 13,557 patents [was] involved in litigation alone; 298 patents were involved in a USPTO proceeding alone; and 1,968 patents were involved in both.", "Accordingly, about 12.7% of litigated patents are also being challenged in the PTAB, and about 86.8% of IPR- or CBM-challenged patents are also being litigated in the federal courts.198", "These statistics suggest that \"PTAB-only cases are relatively rare.... \"199 One could infer from this account that rather than serving as a low-cost litigation substitute, IPRs now form an additional, parallel track that potentially increases the expense and complexity of patent enforcement.200", "Other observers have discerned that the PTAB grants few motions to amend claims; indeed, some assert that despite \"the statutory approval of amending claims in IPRs, in reality, Patent Owners' ability to amend claims has been virtually nonexistent so far.\"201", "The relatively tight statutory deadlines to complete an IPR, as well as an unexpected demand for these proceedings, have been cited as contributing to the PTAB's reluctance to allow amended claims in view of newly cited prior art.202 Congress intended IPRs to improve patent quality.", "But, for some, IPRs appear to do so by invalidating individual patents altogether, rather than by allowing inventors to obtain appropriate claim scope in view of the prior art on a case-by-case basis.203", "Critics of IPRs further observe that, due to the absence of a standing requirement, anyone may file an IPR petition.", "According to some observers, experience \"from only the first few years of IPR proceedings shows that they are frequently utilized by larger competitors to weaken smaller, more innovative ones, as well as by vultures seeking to extract nuisance settlements.\"204", "In addition, the \"absence of a discrete set of potential petitioners\" reportedly \"makes it difficult for inventors and potential investors to adjust their behavior to avoid a potential IPR, as they might do to avoid litigation.\"205", "Some observers believe that the creation of IPRs has had a significant deleterious impact upon the innovation environment of the United States.", "For some, these proceedings can increase the cost and uncertainty associated with patent ownership, \"measurably diminishing their utility as a durable asset on which new businesses, new industries—and indeed, the entire American economy—all depend.", "\"206 Lack of predictability and stability of patent rights might also discourage the injection of venture capital into start-ups and high-technology products.207 IPRs may work especially to the detriment of individual inventors and small firms that lack the resources enjoyed by incumbents.208", "Critics and supporters of IPRs alike tend to agree that these proceedings have emerged as the most prominent component of the entire AIA.209 Detractors assert that IPRs have had a negative impact upon the U.S. patent system and innovation environment, while proponents believe that they have largely met the congressional goal of developing an effective mechanism for challenging suspect patents.", "As Congress potentially revisits IPR reform proposals, five years of experience with these proceedings may prove helpful to policymakers weighing these competing views.", "See N.

(Amgen) in December 2018, Entera initiated pre-clinical work on the first molecule covered by the collaboration.", "Under the collaboration, Entera is eligible to receive up to $270 million upon achievement of various clinical and commercial milestones, or Amgen’s exercise of options to select additional programs to include in the collaboration.", "In addition, Entera is entitled to tiered royalty payments ranging from the low- to mid- single digits based on Amgen’s net sales of any applicable products developed under the collaboration.", "“In 2019 we prioritized our development efforts to therapeutic indications that we believe will create the most value for Entera and our shareholders.", "We have been executing on our plan to complete enrollment in the Phase 2 clinical trial of EB613 in osteoporosis patients and the related regulatory filings with the FDA to support a potential global Phase 3 program, finalizing formulations for EB612 for Hypoparathyroidism, focusing on business development opportunities and enhancing our investor relations activities,” stated Mr. Gridley.", "“We had been tracking to achieve our previously communicated timelines for our ongoing Phase 2 clinical trial in EB613.", "However, based on COVID-19 directives implemented in March 2020 by the Israeli Ministry of Health and our medical institutions, we have temporarily suspended enrollment of new patients in the Phase 2 clinical trial.", "We are continuing to collect patient data from the currently enrolled patients in this trial through various monitoring methods established by the regulatory authorities and continue to plan at this point to report our three-month interim biomarker data in the second quarter of 2020.", "Completion of enrollment and the associated full biomarker and six-month BMD data may be impacted by approximately one quarter at this juncture.”", "- Complete enrollment of ongoing Phase 2 clinical trial of EB613 and report top-line data: Entera expects the

interim three-month top-line biomarker data for the first 50% of the patients enrolled in the trial in Q2:20, the full three-month biomarker data in Q4:20 and topline six-month data in Q1:21.", "Because of the long history of the use of injectable of PTH (1-34) to treat osteoporosis and the well-established correlation of the improvement in biomarkers of bone formation rate and BMD to treatment of the underlying disease, management believes that the biomarker and related BMD data from the trial will be indicative of the potential efficacy of EB613 and important in the finalization of the design of the Phase 3 trial and the ability to use the 505(b)(2) regulatory pathway for potential approval in the United States.", "- Position EB 613 for Phase 3 clinical trial in osteoporosis patients: Based on FDA guidance received at the Company’s pre-IND meeting and subject to the completion of the Phase 2 trial and receipt of positive Phase 2 data, management intends to conduct the additional development work, including filing an Investigation New Drug Application, or IND, with the FDA and preparing a global Phase 3 clinical trial protocol for FDA feedback.", "Management believes a non-inferiority trial of 600-700 osteoporosis patients comparing EB613 with FORTEO, the currently marketed injectable PTH (1-34) treatment for osteoporosis, over a 12-month treatment period evaluating the improvement in BMD and safety would be sufficient to support the regulatory filings required for marketing approvals in the United States and other territories.", "- Conduct additional development work for EB612 to enable initiation of an additional Phase 2b or Phase 3 clinical trial in 2021:", "Entera intends to conduct additional formulation and development activities to determine the final formulation for EB612 to prepare for an initiation in 2021 of an additional Phase 2b or Phase 3 clinical trial of EB612 for the treatment of hypoparathyroidism.", "- Continue development of technology platform and advance business development initiatives: In addition to the advancement of EB613 and EB612 and the ongoing support of the Amgen collaboration, Entera intends to build out its oral drug delivery technology platform through the identification of two new targets for future preclinical development.", "Entera has previously evaluated its technology in multiple large molecules and believes that there are numerous additional product candidates that can benefit from the application of its technology.", "These product candidates have the potential to generate funds, create value and provide further validation of the technology through additional partnerships, such as the collaboration with Amgen, and the Company is targeting additional alliances in 2020 or 2021.", "- Elevate investor awareness through increased investor outreach: Following the expansion of the company’s management and board of directors in the U.S. in 2019, Entera is focusing its efforts to engage with retail and institutional investors through targeted investor and public relations outreach activities.", "In anticipation of the various data readouts from the Phase 2 trial of EB613 and the other anticipated corporate milestones, the Company will be establishing a variety of strategies to enhance its investor awareness in 2020.", "Our corporate objectives for 2020 may be materially and negatively impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic.", "The extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic impacts us will depend on the duration and magnitude of such impact as well as on numerous factors that the company may not be able to accurately predict.", "Financial Results for the Year Ended December 31, 2019", "Revenue for the year ended December 31, 2019 was $0.2 million compared to $0.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2018.", "The decline was largely due to the recognition in 2018 of a majority of the up-front payment received from Amgen in accordance with current accounting guidance.", "The cost of revenues for the year ended December 31, 2019 was $0.2 million compared to $0.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2018.", "In 2019, the cost of revenue was attributable to the R&D

and conduct of the Phase 2 clinical trial of EB613. General and administrative expenses were $4.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to $2.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2018.", "The increase was primarily due to increases in compensation related expenses, director’s fees and insurance costs related to Entera’s public company status for the full year in 2019 relative to only half of the year ended December 31, 2018.", "Net comprehensive loss was $(10.8) million for the year ended December 31, 2019, or $(0.89) per ordinary share, compared to $(10.3) million, or $(1.30) per ordinary share – basic and $(1.31) per ordinary share – diluted, for the year ended December 31, 2018.", "The increase in net loss attributable to common stockholders is attributable to the increased operating loss in 2019 relative to 2018 which was partially offset by changes in the fair value of the warrants and other financial expenses in 2019 as compared to 2018.", "At December 31, 2019, Entera had cash and cash equivalents of $15.2 million, compared to $11.5 million at December 31, 2018.", "Cash at December 31, 2019 excludes approximately $0.8 million, net of expenses, received in February 2020 in connection with the final closing of the private placement that was completed in December 2019.", "Entera expects an operating loss of between $10 million and $12 million for the year ending December 31, 2020 subject to the impact of COVID-19 and believes its current cash position will be sufficient to fund its operations into the second quarter of 2021.", "Entera’s management will host a conference call on Thursday, March 26, 2020 at 8:30 a.m. EDT.

a possible suspension of the Phase 2 clinical trial of EB613; the potential disruption and delay of manufacturing supply chains, loss of available workforce resources, either by Entera or its collaboration and laboratory partners, due to travel restrictions, lay-offs or forced closures or repurposing of hospital facilities; impacts to research and development or clinical activities that Entera is contractually obligated to provide, such as pursuant to Entera’s agreement with Amgen; overall regulatory timelines, if the FDA or other authorities are closed for prolonged periods, choose to allocate resources to review of COVID-19 related drugs or believe that the amount of Phase 2 clinical data collected so far are insufficient to initiate a Phase 3 trial, or a meaningful deterioration of the current political, legal and regulatory situation in Israel or the United States; the availability, quality and timing of the data from the Phase 2 clinical trial of EB613 in osteoporosis patients; the ability find a dose that demonstrates the comparability of EB613 to FORTEO in the ongoing Phase 2 clinical trial of EB613; the size and growth of the potential market for EB613 and Entera’s other product candidates including any possible expansion of the market if an orally delivered option is available in addition to an injectable formulation; the scope, progress and costs of developing Entera’s product candidates; Entera’s reliance on third parties to conduct its clinical trials; Entera’s expectations regarding licensing, business transactions and strategic collaborations;

Herceptin's US patent is due to expire in mid-June and, while the FDA has approved three biosimilars - Ontruzant, Celltrion and Teva Pharmaceutical's Herzuma and Mylan's Ogivri - none have launched yet.", "The path to US approval also hasn't been smooth for all Herceptin biosimilars Pfizer’s Trazimera and Amgen and Allergan’s Kanjinti both received Complete Response Letters last year.", "Credit Suisse predicts a 21% erosion in Herceptin sales in 2019, with up to five approved biosimilars, and erosion of around 50% by 2022.", "On a recent earnings call, Daniel O'Day, then head of Roche's pharmaceuticals division, dismissed the idea that the sales erosion would be as much in the USA as in Europe, saying that he believed the heterogenous nature of the U.S. healthcare system would limit the uptake.", "Despite the company's confidence, however, a worst-case scenario on its top three biologics could leave a $10 billion revenue hole by 2022, according to Ms Elvidge.", "Aurinia Pharmaceuticals has been given a glimmer of hope to push on with voclosporin ophthalmic solution in dry eye disease, but Phase II data released today are far from conclusive about the project's promise, commented Jonathan Gardner writing on Vantage, the editorial arm of the Evaluate group.", "The data contained two surprises. One was that voclosporin was not more tolerable than Allergan's top-selling eyedrop Restasis, meaning that the trial missed its primary endpoint.", "Secondly, Aurinia's candidate showed signs of superior efficacy to Restasis. Allergan’s loss of market exclusivity means that the dry eye market will be tough to break into, and the mark to beat might not be set by Restasis, but rather by Shire’s Xiidra.", "Investors appeared to be confused about the meaning of the data, with a sell-off and recovery pre-market, only to sell again once the markets opened.", "Voclosporin already had mixed results in that setting; the earlier Aura-LV trial in lupus was troubled by an inconsistent dose response and an imbalance in deaths (Aurinia suffers a headache with Aura, August 15, 2016).", "In spite of that setback, the sell-side expects voclosporin sales of $649 million in 2024, according to EvaluatePharma’s consensus.", "Lupus has been a problematic disorder for drug developers. GlaxoSmithKline’s Benlysta was the first agent in 50 years to achieve approval in 2011, and nothing has emerged since.", "It might be just as well that Aurinia has the dry eye indication as a second shot on goal, even if investors are cool to it.", "Adding his voice, Terry Chrisomalis on Seeking Alpha says that Aurinia Pharmaceuticals didn't achieve what it wanted in terms of beating out Restasis as being more tolerable, but it more than made up for it in terms of efficacy.", "It obtained an edge in efficacy using voclosporin on two endpoints known as STT and FCS.", "The fact that voclosporin obtained both efficacy endpoint measures with a rapid onset of action over Restasis should be enough to prove that Aurinia has a good shot at obtaining market share in the dry eye disease space.", "The biggest risk is that a large Phase III study will still be needed in order to gain FDA approval. There is no guarantee that the Phase III study will meet on its primary endpoint with a larger patient population.", "In addition, there is no guarantee that Aurinia will be able to find a partner before it has to raise cash again.", "Other than these risks, Mr Chrisomalis believes that Aurinia is in great shape.", "UK’s foray into value-based pricing antibiotics could stimulate R&R and aid stewardship", "Following the UK government’s announcement (January 24) that the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) and NHS England will trial a value-based pricing model for antibiotics to help stimulate R&D and address growing antimicrobial resistance (AMR) concerns,", "Christopher Pace, director or infectious disease at data and analytics form GlobalData, offers his view on this procurement model:", "‘‘The UK government’s decision to explore value-based pricing for antibiotics represents an important step away from the traditional approach of directly linking payments to sales volume - a pricing strategy that does not work well for antibiotics as it conflicts with stewardship efforts and ultimately discourages the proper use of both new and well-established antibiotics.", "“From the commercial standpoint, a value-based pricing scheme could also help to stimulate antibiotic R&D as companies will be incentivized to position products for smaller groups of patients where high unmet medical need exists, without worrying about stymieing return on investment (ROI).", "“The rising prevalence of AMR represents a global public health crisis of monumental proportions. Governments and other public health stakeholders must acknowledge that in order to successfully combat AMR, stewardship efforts must be paired with a renewed push to discover and develop new antibiotics.", "Procurement models that move away from volume-based payment is an approach worth exploring, because unlike many other drugs, antibiotics arguably lose value the more they are used, pitting drug developers and public stakeholders against one another.", "“Alternative approaches to antibiotic procurement have received increasing attention over the past year, with the US FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb proposing a licensing-based reimbursement model for novel antibiotics.", "Under this proposal, institutions would purchase a license to have access to a predetermined number of doses of a novel antibiotic, rather than paying each time it is used.", "“While slightly different from the UK government’s value-based proposal, both of these ideas illustrate the growing sentiment that changes must be made to current procurement strategies in order to better align them with AMR concerns, while also helping to address R&D hurdles.", "The UK government’s proposal is a bold step in the right direction and merits close attention as it’s implemented in the coming year.”", "Along with presenting 2018 financial results on Friday, AbbVie's chief executive, Richard Gonzalez, has admitted that 2019 will be a “real test” of the group’s strategy to counter Humira sales erosion with new growth products, and the numbers quietly revealed today during the company’s fourth-quarter earnings call show why, observes Jonathan Gardner on Vantage.", "Mr Gonzalez estimated that in 2019 ex-US sales will fall $2 billion thanks to biosimilar entry in Europe and elsewhere, and the company’s guidance is for a 7% increase in US sales – roughly $1 billion.", "This $1 billion decline, on aggregate, comes to more than double the $389 million decrease foreseen by the EvaluatePharma consensus of sell-side forecasts – forecasts which will likely now be revised downwards.", "AbbVie shares tumbled 7% Friday morning. Adding to investor disappointment was Mr Gonzalez’s dismissal of any major M&A action, friendly or hostile; he hinted that the benchmark set by the $20.8 billion Pharmacyclics acquisition might be the upper limit of what AbbVie would consider.", "US Humira sales are expected to grow only $1 billion in 2019, below consensus expectations of +$1.4 billion, noted Leerink Research analyst Geoffrey Porges.", "This guidance contemplates growth of 7%, down from 10% achieved in 2018. Management stated that this is not due to a change in volume trends, but is due to a lighter price contribution for the year.", "AbbVie executed one-time 6.2% price increases for some of its portfolio products in January 2019, which is less than the 9.7% increase taken in January 2018 for Humira.", "Exacerbating the decline of Humira sales, AbbVie also expect $400mm headwind for AndroGel in 2019 due to generic competition which started in the fourth quarter.", "This generic launch has already reduced sequential sales for the product by 44% in fourth-quarter 2018.", "Based on the trends AbbVie expects in 2019, it appears unlikely that the company will meet its previously announced 2020 targets of Humira sales of $21 billion and an operating margin of >50%.", "Other prior guidance items that are questionable include Duodopa and Imbruvica.", "Commented on financials from the US healthcare giant, Blogger ‘The Value Investor’ on Seeking Alpha pointed out that Johnson & Johnson has seen some growth deceleration towards the end of 2018, a trend which the company expects to last into 2019, which should be concerning to investors.", "In the time frame of just a few months, J&J has gone from a strong solid organic growth play to a diversified operation showing less growth and having to deal with asbestos risks as well, as reports scared the financial community back In December.", "While the 3.3% operational growth number reported for the final quarter of 2018 marked a slowdown, investors should not see this as an isolated event.", "For 2019, J&J sees operational growth at 2%-3%, which, combined with two percent currency headwinds, results in flat to 1% reported sales growth in US dollar terms.", "Despite this slower pace of growth, J&J sees adjusted earnings increase from $8.18 per share in 2018 to $8.50-8.65 per share this year.", "The outlook is discomforting as J&J has long been a player with great diversification and international strength, almost guaranteeing growth.", "While consumer sales and medical devices have been growing at a slower pace for a while, the surprise is the slowdown in the core pharmaceutical segment."]}

After a huge dry spell in M&A, 2018 is shaping up to be a great year for deal making.", "And while predicting future match-ups is generally fool’s errand, I can’t help but be intrigued by the dance between multiple sclerosis powerhouse Biogen and drug delivery specialist Alkermes.", "In particular, I’m still wondering about a deal hatched last autumn that gave Biogen rights to ALKS8700—now named BIIB098—and what it might say about the future.", "This drug was being developed by Alkermes as an alternative form of the multiple sclerosis blockbuster Tecfidera.", "Specifically, it was being developed under the 505(b)(2) pathway, which means Alkermes was referencing much existing data on Tecfidera, arguing that their version used a familiar active ingredient.", "Tecfidera is dimethyl fumarate, while ALKS8700/BIIB098 is a prodrug of monomethyl fumarate (MMF). Both are quickly converted to MMF in the body, so what’s a methyl group, give or take?", "It looked, at least to the casual observer, like a clever strategy to make a generic Tecfidera while circumventing some IP issues.", "And the stakes are huge. Tecfidera is far and away Biogen’s top-selling drug, bringing in 2017 sales of $4.2 billion.", "Alkermes’ program looked like a quiet but potentially devastating threat to Biogen’s bread-and-butter MS franchise.", "So why, when it came down to it, did Alkermes give Biogen exclusive worldwide rights to the drug in exchange for mid-teen royalties, a maximum of $200 million in milestones, and some development reimbursement?", "But I think it came down to a few things. One is the argument over whether ALKS8700/BIIB098 is essentially generic Tecfidera, or whether it is really a new chemical entity.", "FDA has always been a little wishy washy about this determination when it comes to prodrugs, sometimes going one way or the other, sometimes reversing itself later.", "A 2014 study in the journal Neurology argued that dimethyl and monomethyl fumarate have very different pharmacodynamic behavior in the body, and that the latter “cannot be considered simply, or only as a prodrug of MMF, as it has distinct pharmacological properties.”", "But since this study was funded by Biogen and conducted by Biogen employees, it seemed more like a political argument against approving ALKS8700/BIIB098 through the 505(b)(2) pathway.", "Turns out, Biogen may have seen more going on here. The company is now excited about developing the drug as an alternative to Tecfidera—one that could have a better tolerability profile, particularly around GI effects.", "And if it turns out to also have even modestly improved efficacy, it will be a huge home run for Biogen.", "Biogen successfully defended a key patent on Tecfidera this past summer against a suit brought by lawyer-turned-drug-patent-warrior Kyle Bass, theoretically ensuring protection through 2028.", "But in truth, Tecfidera may still be vulnerable—potentially as soon as 2021, if other challengers can invalidate a single patent.", "Biogen has a serious interest in hedging its bets, and ALKS8700/BIIB098 has exclusivity through 2033.", "So how did it leverage such a strong deal with Alkermes? The company may have made the case that Alkermes was unlikely to get far on its own with a drug that Biogen could probably delay and then massively outmarket with its own sales force.", "Biogen could have potentially forced them to generic-like pricing and margins, making a mid-teens royalty look relatively attractive.", "Moreover, this may be a case of two companies being stronger together. Alkermes and Biogen have both become CNS companies.", "Beyond the overlap in multiple sclerosis, Alkermes’ focus on addiction, depression, and schizophrenia could broaden and de-risk Biogen’s own focus on Alzheimer’s (a highly speculative area) and other neurodegenerative diseases.", "It could also allow Biogen to follow in the footsteps of blue chip competitor Amgen by having an arm dedicated to lower-risk products—not biosimilars, in this case, but royalty-bearing versions of drugs with enhanced delivery properties.", "Perhaps most importantly, as we saw from last autumn’s deal on ALKS8700, Biogen has shown its very interested in extending patient life—the business on which Alkermes built itself.", "It certainly may not happen, but it could be one of the more intriguing biotech match-ups."]}

(“Amgen”), while engaged in a drug development partnership with Micromet, Inc. (“Micromet” or the “Company”), periodically made offers to buy Micromet.", "Micromet’s Board of Directors (the “Board”) rejected Amgen’s offers as being inadequate, and instead pursued a standalone strategy in which it would partner with established biopharmaceutical companies in developing drugs in its product pipeline.", "Beginning in late December 2011, Micromet was sufficiently piqued by Amgen’s then $10.75 per share potential proffer that it authorized Goldman, Sachs & Co. (“Goldman”), its financial advisor, to contact seven large pharmaceutical companies the Board determined might be interested in acquiring Micromet because of the potential strategic fit.", "Of the seven companies (all but one of which had already conducted due diligence on the Company in the context of the partnering process), only three expressed interest, and after conducting due diligence sessions none of them indicated that they were interested in acquiring Micromet.", "During the market check, Micromet began negotiations with Amgen. On January 25, Micromet entered into a Merger Agreement with Amgen providing for a tender offer to Micromet’s shareholders at $11 per share, followed by a second-step cash out merger.", "As part of the Merger Agreement, the Board agreed to various standard deal protection measures in favor of Amgen, including a no shop, a four-business-day match right and a break-up fee of $40 million, which was equal to approximately 3.4% of the equity value, and 4.9% of the enterprise value, of the transaction.", "On February 27, various shareholders of Micromet (“Plaintiffs”) brought a motion for a preliminary injunction in the Delaware Court of Chancery to enjoin the tender offer, asserting that the Board breached its fiduciary duties by favoring Amgen as a bidder, failing to do any meaningful market check until immediately before the announcement of the proposed transaction and putting in place deal protections that would make it impossible for a competing bidder to make a successful offer.", "Additionally, Plaintiffs asserted that the Board breached its fiduciary duty of disclosure by omitting material information from the disclosure statement that was disseminated to its shareholders.", "On February 29, 2012, Vice Chancellor Parsons denied Plaintiffs’ motion for a preliminary injunction.", "Vice Chancellor Parsons’ denial of a motion for a preliminary injunction in Micromet reaffirmed that (i) Revlon’s enhanced scrutiny is a reasonableness standard based on the particular circumstances of the target company and (ii) Delaware’s fiduciary duty of disclosure only requires that the information provided to shareholders for purposes of their vote on a transaction be sufficiently robust in its entirety so that the information omitted would not significantly alter the total mix of information available to shareholders.", "A. Reaffirmation of Revlon Duties and Adequate Pre-Signing Market Check", "Vice Chancellor Parsons held that the length and breadth of the pre-signing market check conducted by the Board was adequate to fulfill its Revlon duties because it was based on the Board’s understanding of Micromet’s market position – specifically that any company that would be interested in an acquisition of Micromet would be one that was interested in the development of its most important drug (MT103) and was large enough to undertake the transaction.", "As such, Vice Chancellor Parsons found it reasonable that the Board chose to limit its pre-signing market check to strategic buyers that could benefit from and further develop MT103, and had the technical expertise to realize its full potential.", "Vice Chancellor Parsons also was untroubled by the diligence period provided to the potential bidders during the pre- signing market check being limited to one week, in large part because six of the seven potential buyers had engaged in due diligence with Micromet focused on its most important potential product during a previous partnering process, and each of the three that performed due diligence informed Micromet before it signed the Merger Agreement with Amgen that it was not interested in making a competing offer.", "The Micromet court also was not persuaded that the omissions from the disclosure statement sent to shareholders was sufficient to show a reasonable probability of success on a breach of fiduciary duty of disclosure claim.", "Under Delaware law, in assessing whether a Board has breached its fiduciary duty of disclosure by failing to disclose material information to shareholders, the central question is whether “‘a reasonable shareholder would consider it important in a decision pertaining to his or her stock.’", "An omitted fact is not material ‘simply because [it] might be helpful.’ Instead, the inclusion of the missing fact must ‘significantly alter the total mix of information available to shareholders.’”", "[2] Furthermore, “[t]he duty to disclose ‘is not a mandate for prolixity’” [3] and “‘[b]alanced against the requirement of complete disclosure is the pragmatic consideration that creating a lenient standard for materiality poses the risk that the corporation will bury the shareholders in an avalanche of trivial information, a result that is hardly conducive to informed decisionmaking.’”", "[4] To this end, Vice Chancellor Parsons held that the following additional disclosures were unlikely to significantly alter the total mix of available information and, accordingly, their omission was not sufficient to lead to injunctive relief on the issue of a breach of duty of disclosure:", "- the specific fees Micromet paid Goldman over the previous two years, when it was generally disclosed that Micromet had paid Goldman fees in the past and Goldman’s contingent fee interest in the transaction was disclosed to shareholders;", "- Goldman’s $336 million specific interest in Amgen stock, representing .16% of its overall investment holdings on behalf of the firm and firm clients and 3.8% of its healthcare sector investments, when it was generally disclosed that Goldman may at any time hold positions in both Amgen and Micromet, the information was already available via publicly filed information (on Goldman’s Form 13F), there was no evidence that the size of its holdings would be likely to impede its ability “effectively and loyally” to perform its assignment for Micromet, and Goldman held an equal or greater interest in two of the bidders Goldman reached out to during the pre-signing market check;", "- the basis for the probability of success rates for the drugs in Micromet’s product pipeline, which was used by Goldman in its analysis, when such underlying information is highly technical, concerns assumptions made by the Board relating to the viability of specific and unique drugs being developed by Micromet and it would be hard to determine whether the rates applied were, as asserted by Plaintiffs, unusually low (Vice Chancellor Parsons noting that Delaware courts repeatedly have held that a board is not required to disclose details underlying a financial advisor’s opinion);", "- management’s projections regarding Micromet’s expected use of net operating loss carry-forwards, since the provisions of such information would involve a “level of granular disclosure not required under our law”;", "- Goldman’s “sum of the parts” discounted cash flow analysis because, even though it was prepared at the request of the Board, it was not relied on for Goldman’s fairness opinion and the valuation range was substantially similar to the valuation range of the discounted cash flow analysis disclosed; and", "- “upside case” projections prepared by management, where such projections were not relied on by the financial advisor and at least some of the directors found the projections to be unreliable and overly optimistic.", "Insofar as it reaffirms what is already known to be established law, Micromet is not particularly interesting.", "However, Micromet is useful to practitioners as a primer for the application of fiduciary duty of disclosure claims to the specifics of financial analyses, and as a reminder of the importance of disclosure with respect to significant conflicting interests of transaction participants.", "[1] In re Micromet, Inc., C.A. no. 7197-VCP, slip op. at 32 (Del.

determination of the invalidity and unenforceability of the `516 patent as a whole is at odds with the policy and purpose of the Act and is contrary to judicial economy, finality, and fairness to Amgen.", "According to Amgen, this is particularly true where, as here, litigation has been ongoing for an extended period of time and it has expended substantial time and resources to support its positions on these issues.", "Amgen points to the timing of the Covenant, on the day Markman briefs and motions for summary judgment were filed, as an eleventh-hour attempt by ARIAD to avoid the

designed to treat cancer and inflammatory diseases are allegedly enveloped by the `516 patent, and Amgen has four such drugs in Phase III trials, seven such drugs in Phase II trials, and five such drugs in Phase I trials. . . .", "It is reasonable to expect that ARIAD will continue to attempt to enforce the `516 patent against Amgen as new products and activities continue to roll out. . . .",

Amgen (and/or others) back into court to re-litigate the same issues as here with respect to other claims of the patent.", "ARIAD's insufficient partial covenant does not divest this Court of jurisdiction, and ARIAD's motion for partial dismissal on the basis of this covenant must be denied.", "Amgen also asks for attorneys' fees if the motion is granted, contending that due to the timing of the Covenant \"ARIAD has attempted to manipulate these proceedings and divest the court of authority to determine whether the claims of the `516 patent are invalid.", "There are 203 claims to the

Crystal Chemical Co. and the statement therein concerning how inequitable conduct during prosecution may be cured:", "Specifically, the narrow issue we now deal with is whether voluntary efforts during prosecution by or on behalf of an applicant, knowing that misrepresentations have been made to the examiner of his application, can ever alleviate its effect.", "Taking into account human frailty and all of the objectives of the patent system, we think it desirable to permit misdeeds to be overcome under certain limited circumstances. . . .", "[W]e also think it desirable to reserve the possibility of expiation of wrongdoing where an applicant chooses to take the necessary action on his own initiative and to take it openly.", "722 F.2d 1556, 1571-72 (Fed. Cir. 1983) (emphasis added).", "Amgen argues that there was nothing \"voluntary\" about ARIAD's disclosures to the PTO and that ARIAD made no effort to \"comply\" with its duty of candor until Amgen put forth its inequitable conduct contentions.", "The Rohm court set forth certain requirements in which a prior misdeed may be cured:", "The first requirement to be met by an applicant, aware of misrepresentation in the prosecution of his application and desiring to overcome it, is that he expressly advise the PTO of its existence, stating specifically wherein it resides.", "The second requirement is that, if the misrepresentation is of one or more facts, the PTO be advised what the actual facts are, the applicant making it clear that further examination in light thereof may be required if any PTO action has been based on the misrepresentation.", "Finally, on the basis of the new and factually accurate record, the applicant must establish patentability of the claimed subject matter.", "Considering the overall objectives of the patent system, we think it desirable that inventions meeting the statutory requirements for patentability be patented and, therefore, we also think it desirable to reserve the possibility of expiation of wrongdoing where an applicant chooses to take the necessary action on his own initiative and to take it openly.", "It does not suffice that one knowing of misrepresentations in an application or in its prosecution merely supplies the examiner with accurate facts without calling his attention to the untrue or misleading assertions sought to be overcome, leaving him to formulate his own conclusions.", "The Rohm court held that \"where intentional material misrepresentations have been made, as here, a complete `cure' must also be demonstrated by clear, unequivocal, and convincing evidence.\"", "Amgen also maintains that ARIAD has not cured its inequitable conduct because its disclosure to the PTO do not provide the \"clear, unequivocal, and convincing evidence\" required by Rohm and, instead, merely left the examiner \"to formulate his own conclusions.\"", "As such, Amgen urges the court to deny ARIAD's motion.", "ARIAD contends that the Federal Circuit's opinion in Young v. Lumenis, Inc., rather than Rohm Haas, provides the proper framework to consider its motion.", "In Young, the court considered \"whether there was a `failure to disclose' material information to the PTO sufficient to constitute inequitable conduct when that information was disclosed before the examiner's final Office Action, albeit only after the issue of disclosure was raised in a parallel district court action.\"", "There, Young brought an infringement action against Lumenis. During the pendency of that litigation, Lumenis requested a reexamination of the patent-in-suit by the PTO.", "The PTO issued a first office action in the reexamination rejecting certain claims as unpatentable over two references submitted by Lumenis.", "One of those references was a chapter in a veterinary textbook, edited by Fossum (the \"Fossum reference\").", "Approximately three weeks after that office action, Young submitted a response distinguishing the Fossum reference from the rejected claims.", "After further prosecution, the PTO issued a Reexamination Certificate which confirmed the patentability of all claims.", "During the reexamination proceeding, the trial court held a Markman hearing during which, Hedlund (author of the textbook containing the Fossum reference) testified concerning that reference.", "After Young filed its response to the first office action with the PTO, Lumenis filed a motion for summary judgement of unenforceability due to inequitable conduct during the reexamination in the district court action.", "Part of the basis for that motion was Young's failure to disclose the Hedlund deposition testimony to the PTO.", "Approximately three weeks later, Young submitted that testimony to the PTO. Citing Rohm Haas, the district court granted Lumenis' motion for summary judgment finding, inter alia, that Young did not provide the information to the PTO on his \"own initiative\" as that information was only filed after defendant's summary judgment motion.", "The Federal Circuit reversed that determination. The court concluded \"that there was no `failure to disclose material information' to the PTO because the alleged material information was disclosed to the PTO at a time when it could be considered by the examiner.\"", "The submission of the Hedlund deposition testimony:", "occurred after the examiner had issued its first Office Action in the reexamination, but more than five months before the examiner had issued a second Office Action.", "The examiner was therefore fully apprised of the Hedlund deposition testimony and was able to fully consider it and any potential effects it may have on the patentability of the claims before issuing his second Office Action.", "Thus, we cannot agree that there was inequitable conduct resulting from the \"failure to disclose material information\" when that information was disclosed to the PTO in time for the examiner to consider it.", "The court noted that \"[t]he essence of the duty of disclosure is to get relevant information before an examiner in time for him to act on it, and that did occur here.\"", "Significantly, the court also noted the district court's reliance on Rohm Haas but found it distinguishable \"particularly because in that case the issue related to an alleged false affidavit, where a cure hurdle may be higher than here.", "In this case, the issue related to an alleged omission, and that omission was cured by a timely submission.\"", "Id. at 1349-50 (citing Scripps Clinic Research Foundation v.

After Amgen received Kadesch's Roche testimony and sought leave to augment its inequitable conduct allegations to include ARIAD's failure to submit that testimony to the PTO, ARIAD submitted that testimony (along with the additional materials referenced above) at a time when the examiner \"was fully able to consider it and any potential effects it may have on the patentability of the claims.\"", "Consequently, with regard to the Kadesch submissions, ARIAD's motion for summary judgment is granted.", "Amgen's expert, Mossinghoff opined that \"it is my opinion that those substantively involved in the preparation and prosecution of the reexamination of the `516 patent . . .", "who submitted to the USPTO during the Reexamination of the `516 patent both the testimony and report of Dr. Kadesch from the . . .", "Lilly litigation and Dr. Kadesch's recantation of that testimony in the . . .

\"I do not believe it to be correct\"; \"[t]hat can't be true\"; \"[b]ased on my understanding and experience, the first statement to the [PTO] is not correct.", "The particular language of the Verma declaration (filed in response to the examiner's rejection of certain claims for anticipation and/or obviousness over prior art) referred to include Verma's disagreement with the examiner that the use of certain compounds in the prior art inherently anticipated the rejected claims.", "[T]here is considerable uncertainty relating to the potential mechanism of action of glucocorticoids in cells, including whether there are any potential effects on NF-B . . .", "The mechanisms by which glucocorticoids, including dexamethasone, mediate inflammatory responses are poorly understood . . .", "[T]he fact that dexamethasone (or any other glucocorticoid) is administered to cells does not indicate that the administration of that glucocorticoid necessarily reduced induced NF-B activity or NF-B mediated-intracellular signaling.", "Amgen contends that those affirmative representations are \"flatly contradicted\" by statements made in the Verma articles.", "For instance, one article states that previous studies showed that dexamethasone \"leads to repression of NF-B-activated transcription.\"", "In another article, Verma and his co-authors state that glucocorticoids \"also inhibit the action of several transcription factors that are essential for immunity, such as . . .", "Amgen also points to statements in the Verma declaration questioning inhibition of NF-B by components of red wine which are purportedly shown to be misstatements when compared to statements in one of the Verma articles.", "In the Verma declaration, \"red wine\" is said to be \"a generic term covering many different mixtures having in common the characteristic of being red in color,\" therefore, one would not know \"what, if anything, would have induced NF-B activity in cells, or what, if anything, would have acted to reduce NF-B activity in cells . . .\"", "One of the Verma articles, however, states that \"resveratrol, which is found in grapes and red wine, [has] been found to downregulate KIK and IKK/, resulting in inhibition of IKK activiation, decreased I-B-degradation, decreased p65 translocation, and a decrease in NF-B activity.\"", "Without deciding the question, because ARIAD avers that its motion asks a purely legal question as to whether its submissions to the PTO cured any potential inequitable conduct during the reexamination proceeding, the court determines that the evidence presented at least raises a question of fact as to whether the Verma declaration is a \"false affidavit, where a cure hurdle may be higher\" than under Young.", "ARIAD states that \"the expert reports submitted by ARIAD in this action provide an exhaustive explanation of Dr. Verma's submissions to the PTO.", "We do not repeat those here, since they are not germane to the present motion.\" The court agrees that those explanations are not germane to the issue presented here (whether the submission of the Verma articles, in and of itself, cures any inequitable conduct associated therewith).", "Those explanations, combined with the testimony of Amgen's experts that the Verma declaration contains false statements (as well as the text of the Verma declaration and that of the Verma articles) do raise a question of fact as to that question.", "ARIAD argues that even under a Rohm and Haas analysis its motion should be granted. Under that analysis, ARIAD contends that it \"has satisfied at least the first and third criteria identified therein.\"", "Without commenting on that contention, the court cannot find, as a matter of law, that ARIAD's submissions of the Verma articles was a \"voluntary effort\" taken on ARIAD's \"own initiative\" as the submissions were in response to Amgen's filings in this case.", "For that reason, at least, ARIAD's motion must be denied with respect to Amgen's inequitable conduct allegations related to the Verma submissions.", "Consequently, with regard to the Verma submissions, ARIAD's motion for summary judgment is denied.", "It is ORDERED AND ADJUDGED that: GRANTED.

We need to work with jurisdictions, governments, and payors to find a way to bring innovation that makes a difference to the people who need it.", "McKinsey: How do you respond to these trends in a way that differentiates you from the crowd?", "Esteban Santos: Amgen was founded on the belief that innovation brings value to society. We’ve done a good job in balancing the short-term cost pressures and the long-term need to innovate in order to succeed.", "We innovate through our “biology first” approach to research and development and also through the technologies we use to manufacture our products.", "By innovating, we can reduce the cost of medicines as well as improve their safety, efficacy, quality, and reliability.", "We believe in our mission to serve patients and that is reflected in every aspect of our culture.", "McKinsey: How do you see operations evolving to meet challenges like these?", "Esteban Santos: We see operations as a competitive advantage for Amgen. To retain that advantage and advance our capabilities, we focus on reliability, efficiency, agility, and differentiation.", "Reliable supply—getting medicines to patients in an ever more complex world—has long been a strength for Amgen.", "That was a differentiator in the early days of biotech; today it’s just the entry ticket.", "The next element is to keep finding ways to be more efficient and productive. How do we eliminate work that doesn’t add value and redeploy people and capital to fund the R&D machine and commercial expansion?", "Reliability and efficiency remain important, but they are no longer sufficient to ensure our success.", "We also have to become more agile in how we deliver our products and services. That’s nothing new for other industries, but it is for our industry", "and we need to get faster and nimbler. That’s a challenge in a heavily regulated sector. We can’t match the rapid product cycles you see in, say, electronics because we have to work with regulators in multiple jurisdictions around the world that sometimes have differing requirements.", "And regulators tend to be on the conservative side, which is only appropriate given the impact of what we do on people’s lives.", "If your app doesn’t work you can just get another one, but if the medicine you take to keep you alive doesn’t work, that’s a big deal.", "So we need to be thoughtful about balancing the desire to innovate with implications for the people we serve.", "Finally, differentiation could be in better processes with higher titers, new manufacturing technologies, and improved products with better formulations and delivery devices.", "McKinsey: How do you make those strategic shifts in operations to remain competitive?", "Esteban Santos: First, we need innovation from our R&D labs, and then the ability to commercialize it.", "Operations has traditionally earned its seat at the table in a support role, not as the main event. But in an uncertain environment, the way we launch a new product can make a real difference.", "Operations is the team that turns innovation into something real in the hands of a healthcare practitioner and ultimately in the body of a patient.", "And it’s up to us to supply reliably in a cost-efficient manner, but one that is faster to market and has differentiating product features.", "As we head into markets crowded with products, it gets harder to predict the demand for established products facing loss of exclusivity, or new products facing competition from day one.", "So we can’t be content to build to a forecast. The thing about forecasts is that they are by definition wrong—whether up, down, or sideways—but I don’t know by how much.", "Agility is a countermeasure to uncertainty. It can improve speed to market and speed in the market when things change.", "Agility can undermine the reliability that’s fundamental to our business, but at Amgen we believe agility can enhance reliability.", "If it usually takes months to ramp up production and get a product to market, then as we become more agile by reducing our cycle times, we can be more reliable because we can react to an uncertain environment with less risk to supply.", "We’ve been able to reduce the time to build and commission a new plant by two years. That allows us to wait longer before making a commitment, giving us time to have more certainty about the forecast before investing.", "To get it right, operations needs to be plugged in to what’s happening in the market, working hand in hand with the commercial team to get the right amount of medicines to patients.", "In addition to agility, we need to focus on differentiation in the areas of products, process, technology, and people.", "And our process-development team plays a big role in building that ecosystem for patients, particularly where combination products are concerned.", "That’s something we invested in and went from having one combination product to now having the capability to design and manufacture a suite of solutions for patients.", "That’s the culture we’re building: constantly innovating to make things better and faster. And the last element of differentiation is people.", "We have incredibly talented staff with expertise in manufacturing, quality, engineering, supply chain, and process development.", "Our job now is to see how we can move from having experts in individual areas to having leaders that integrate thinking across all of them.", "These things aren’t possible without the right people, so nurturing a culture of innovation focused on the mission to serve patients is important.", "Showing your team that you care about them and their development is key.", "Whoever cracks the code for doing these things will have a competitive advantage.", "McKinsey: What kind of building blocks does it take?", "Esteban Santos: For one thing, we’re looking at our supply chain end-to-end to help us react to changes in demand much faster, without having to start all the way back in drug substance.", "We’re isolating the long-cycle part of our business so that the short-cycle part can be closer to the patient, and then we’re segmenting that part into steady products, new launches, and medicines facing patent or market pressures.", "We’re going from a one-size-fits-all supply chain to one that’s fine-tuned to each market’s competitive landscape and needs.", "We’re also investing in our information systems to help us get a better view of what’s happening and to react more quickly to signal changes.", "If it takes us a month to detect a change and another month to analyze it, we’re two months too late.", "The challenge is to see what’s going on and adjust our decision making in close to real time.", "Biopharma Frontiers: What the future holds for the industry", "And we’re reducing our cycle times as much as we can. I’m not talking about lopping an hour off changeovers, that’s good continuous improvement, but I’m talking about the big picture.", "If I say “go” today, why does it take months to see the benefit? I want to turn months into weeks, and weeks into days.", "McKinsey: How is your view of manufacturing changing as you build new facilities?", "Esteban Santos: There’s more to differentiation than products and processes. We have made a bold investment in advancing manufacturing technologies.", "Other companies have chosen not to; in a regulated environment, it’s easier to stay with the known than move into the new.", "But our leadership believes in innovation and is willing to put money and resources behind it—and that’s a key differentiator for us.", "Take the disposable technologies we adopted to reduce our upfront capital investment on utilities, and our breakthrough in increasing the titers of our processes, which allowed us to create a smaller facility with the same output as a traditional one.", "All this started several years ago when a group of process-development and R&D leaders produced a white paper about what the future of biologics manufacturing could be.", "Fast forward to today and our engineers and scientists have made it into a reality.", "We worked closely with regulators around the world to make sure they understood what we were trying to do.", "We checked whether anything concerned them, and acted on their feedback without losing the essence of our concept.", "And we got approval in all major jurisdictions, which speaks for the regulators’ enthusiasm for the technology.", "We already have the first product approvals and we’re working on the second wave, so we’re confident this is the right technology for the future.", "McKinsey: Earlier you mentioned cross-functional leadership; what part did that play in getting your new facilities off the ground?", "Esteban Santos: The idea of what’s possible came from a technical team looking at the biology. How could we make cells more productive and get higher yields from our processes?", "Big ideas—but our leadership was behind us. Then our manufacturing, quality, engineering, and supplier-relationship teams made sure we could harness emerging technologies on the factory floor.", "Back in 2013, we didn’t have a single Amgen staff member in Singapore. Today, we have a new factory with approval to supply commercial products.", "From idea to reality, I think we set an industry record for speed. All that involved a very broad set of contributions from many people.", "McKinsey: How do you think regulation could change in the future to keep the industry safe while relaxing some constraints?", "Esteban Santos: We’ve learned that by engaging regulators early on, we can maintain continuity in our interactions.", "They tell us what they think and we make an honest effort to understand them and translate their feedback into practical applications.", "Maybe you need sweat equity to make the investment, and then constant contact to bring the regulators along with you as you evolve technologies.", "When concerns arise, you need further conversations to establish how fundamental they are; sometimes they can be mitigated by different but suitable means.", "I don’t think there’s a simple answer. It’s a lot of work. But if you don’t do it, either you’re not innovating and fall behind, or you risk your innovation being left on the shelf.", "McKinsey: Company leaders today have to work under high uncertainty across multiple functions while also pushing the boundaries of innovation—which is asking a lot of people who grew up in a very different environment 20 or 30 years ago.", "Esteban Santos: I’m feeling optimistic about what I’ve seen so far, and confident because I’ve got my team behind me.", "I’m also optimistic because of what we’ve demonstrated we can do. We expanded from being primarily in the United States and Europe to being a global company in about 100 countries.", "We’ve built capabilities in combination products that we didn’t have five years ago. We’ve brought forward innovative technologies like our next-generation plant in Singapore.", "I talk to leaders within and beyond ops about what we’re doing well and where the opportunities lie, and their feedback helps develop my thinking.", "So does my experience in other industries. I didn’t grow up in pharma; for the first part of my career I saw similar things happening elsewhere, which helps me understand some of the possibilities.", "Amgen has an incredible culture that helps people get it intellectually, and then get it done. We’re not a command-and-control organization; to make things happen, we have to win people’s hearts and minds."]}

In particular, concerns regarding pure red cell aplasia (PRCA) and increased cardiovascular-related adverse events have been of great interest to the nephrology community and are relevant to the development of new ESAs.", "The sudden appearance outside the US of patients presenting with antibody-mediated PRCA in the late 1990s, primarily associated with subcutaneous administration of Eprex, highlighted the potential consequence of manufacturing changes on product safety.[14]", "Furthermore, several cardiovascular (CV) outcome-related studies pointed to an increase in CV adverse events associated with higher hemoglobin targets and the increasing doses of ESAs required to achieve those targets.[15,16]", "As a consequence, the FDA (as well as other regulatory bodies around the world) stipulated a warning in 2007 for all ESAs prompting clinicians to use the lowest dose of drug in patients to maintain adequate hemoglobin levels.[17]", "A small number of case reports of an antibody-mediated form of PRCA associated with ESA therapy began to appear in the literature around the mid-1990s, but the complication did not receive much attention until an “epidemic” of ESA-associated PRCA occurred between 1998 and 2004.[18]", "In 1998, Johnson & Johnson, the manufacturer of Eprex, changed the stabilizing agent of the product from human serum albumin to polysorbate 80 and glycine, prompted by European concern about the potential for transmission of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease.[14] After much study, it was hypothesized that the polysorbate 80 may have increased the immunogenicity of Eprex by eliciting formation of epoetin-containing micelles or by interacting with leachates released by the uncoated rubber stoppers of prefilled syringes for subcutaneous administration.[19]", "Compared with the previous formulation, the polysorbate 80 formulation had a lower stability, making it more susceptible to stress conditions (e.g., insufficient attention to the cold chain).", "This situation may have facilitated protein denaturation or aggregate formation.[20]", "From 1999 to 2002, global reports of antibody-mediated PRCA increased with more than 60 cases of PRCA reported with Eprex per year.[18]", "In December 2002, health authorities in Europe formally contraindicated subcutaneous administration of Eprex for patients with chronic kidney disease.[19,21]", "The incidence of PRCA returned to historical low rates by 2003 after Johnson & Johnson replaced the uncoated rubber stoppers with Teflon stoppers in the prefilled syringes, supported intravenous administration of the product, and improved cold chain storage management.[14,20] The contraindication for subcutaneous administration of Eprex was later removed in 2006 after completion of the PRIMS study, which showed that rates of PRCA had returned to the expected background incidence.[19]", "As treatment with ESAs were rarely ‘switched’ during this time period, it is likely that identification of the source of immunogenicity in patients receiving Eprex was the result of a common treatment pattern by nephrologists.", "Although the dramatic spike in PRCA cases has decreased since the early 2000s, a small number of cases have continued to be reported worldwide—almost all associated with subcutaneous administration.", "Although intravenous administration of a protein is less likely to evoke an immune response than the subcutaneous route, PRCA with intravenous administration of epoetin has been reported in the literature, including a case in Japan where a patient received both epoetin alfa and darbepoetin alfa.[22] Two additional cases of PRCA with intravenous epoetin have been described, but follow-up did not preclude the subcutaneous route of administration.[23]", "Furthermore, several cases of PRCA have also been reported following the use of epoetin ‘copy’ biologics in regions where there are less rigorous regulations regarding product storage and manufacturing.[20]", "The use of blood transfusions and androgenic steroids for the treatment of anemia in patients with CKD was supplanted by ESAs, likely the result of improved quality of life in early studies involving erythropoietin and CKD.", "As the link between cardiovascular disease and CKD became more evident, it became clear that anemia was an independent risk factor for developing left ventricular hypertrophy and heart failure.", "However, in the absence of well-controlled studies, ESAs became the mainstay to treat anemia while the optimal level of hemoglobin to limit cardiovascular events remained unknown.", "Between 1991 and 2005, the mean ESA dose increased about four-fold in dialysis patients in the US.[24]", "Following reports of increased adverse events from outcomes studies, such as cardiovascular events and more frequent hypertensive episodes when using higher doses of ESAs to achieve higher hemoglobin targets, the FDA mandated a black box warning for all ESAs in 2007.[17]", "The decision was based on key data obtained from the Normal Hematocrit Cardiac Trial (NHCT),[25] the Correction of Hemoglobin and Outcomes in Renal Insufficiency (CHOIR) study, [15] and the Cardiovascular Risk Reduction by Early Anemia Treatment with Epoetin Beta (CREATE) study.[16]", "Briefly, the results of NHCT pointed to an increase in vascular access thrombosis and a trend towards death and heart attacks among dialysis patients in the higher hematocrit arm, while the CHOIR study confirmed an increased risk of a composite endpoint including death and cardiovascular events among predialysis patients targeted to higher hematocrit levels.", "The CREATE study did not demonstrate differences between patients assigned to either full or partial correction of anemia in terms of cardiovascular events, but a prespecified secondary analysis showed a higher risk of end-stage renal disease requiring dialysis among the patients with the higher target for hemoglobin concentration.", "More recent studies, including the Trial to Reduce Cardiovascular Events with Aranesp Therapy (TREAT) and the subanalysis of the Reduction of Events by Darbepoetin Alfa in Heart Failure (RED-HF) study, reinforce the aforementioned data and demonstrate the correction of anemia in CKD patients with ESAs does not confer a beneficial effect on mortality, or cardiovascular or renal outcomes.[26,27]", "As noted, biologics are genetically-engineered proteins derived from human, animal, or microorganism sources.", "They are a major area of growth in the medical community, accounting for one-third of new medicine approvals in the past decade.[28]", "As of 2013, the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America reported more than 900 biologics in development.[28] Biologics play an integral and often transformative role in many therapeutic settings, and guidelines from medical societies and payer groups have incorporated biologics into recommended treatment regimens, either as primary or supportive care.[4]", "Despite the immense therapeutic benefit conferred to patients, the growing use of biologics comes at a significant cost, representing one of the fastest growing segments of stretched healthcare budgets around the world.[29] Unlike small-molecule drugs, synthesized by chemically reproducible processes, biologics are genetically-engineered proteins that are produced by living systems and have inherent variability.", "Due to the large and structurally complex molecules that comprise biologics, as well as differences in cell lines and processes used during manufacturing, “identical” copies of biologics cannot be developed.", "Thus, a similar copy of a biologic drug, a “biosimilar”, is not to be regarded as a generic version of a currently approved biologic.", "Rather, a biosimilar is a biologic drug that is highly similar to an approved reference biologic drug.", "The high level of similarity to the reference product includes the same primary structure, mechanism of action, and drug target, among other physiochemical similarities, based on the results of an extensive comparability exercise which includes clinical confirmation of pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics outlined by regulatory authorities.[30,31] A product that does not meet these standards cannot be approved as a biosimilar.", "For biosimilars to achieve full acceptance in global markets, it is crucial that they be considered analytically, pharmacokinetically, and therapeutically equivalent with their reference product.", "Thus, biosimilars must go through a rigorous development process and comparability exercise, and demonstrate no clinically significant differences in safety, purity, and potency compared to the reference product.", "Given the inherent variability of a biologic compared with a small-drug molecules and acknowledging a biosimilar cannot be “identical” to a reference biologic product (which itself is structurally variable from batch to batch), regulatory authorities recognized the need for a unique approval pathway for biosimilars distinct from generics.", "The European Union (EU) was the first to establish a specific regulatory pathway for biosimilars. In 2001, Directive 2001/83/EC provided the legal basis for approval of biosimilars in the EU.", "The directive allowed the EMA to draft the first biosimilar guideline and publish in 2005, after resolution of the Eprex PRCA outbreak.", "The guideline outlined the basic principles of the EU biosimilar regulatory approach; specifically, demonstrating similarity of a biosimilar with its reference product in terms of quality, safety, and efficacy through analytical and clinical studies.[32]", "One year later, the EMA adopted biosimilar guidelines to address issues in analytical studies (e.g., selection of a reference product, methods, and product characterization, and demonstration of biological activity and purity) as well as nonclinical and clinical studies (e.g., pharmacotoxicological assessment, pharmacokinetics, efficacy, and safety).[33] An additional guideline tackled the need for post-approval safety monitoring and a risk-management plan that highlights immunogenicity.[34]", "The EMA has also developed class-specific guidelines for recombinant erythropoietins, interferon β, and, more recently, monoclonal antibodies.[34–36] Of note is the significant role that the outbreak of PRCA, after a manufacturing change with Eprex, played in development of the biosimilar guidelines for EPO.", "Interestingly, the definition of a biosimilar is not a consensus by regulatory authorities and each country adopts its own (Table 2).", "In 2009, the WHO published a guideline that presents globally acceptable principles to license biosimilars that can be adapted to meet the needs of regulatory authorities in countries with no published guidance.[37]", "The guideline is thought to be an initial step in the harmonization to evaluate and regulate biosimilars, and several countries have adopted its principles to elaborate their own guidelines, including Canada, South Korea, and Brazil to name a few.[38]", "Despite the existence of slight differences in the scope of available guidelines, the basic principles governing regulatory requirements for biosimilars are of a similar nature across different nations.[38,39] This generally includes preclinical and clinical comparability studies to demonstrate safety and efficacy as well as post-manufacturing assays to examine immunogenicity.", "| Europe | EMA | Biosimilar | A biological medicinal product that contains a version of the active substance of an already authorized original biological medicinal product (reference medicinal product).", "Similarity to the reference medicinal product in terms of quality characteristics, biological activity, safety and efficacy based on a comprehensive comparability exercise needs to be established.", "| Global | WHO | Similar biotherapeutic product | A biotherapeutic product similar to an already licensed reference biotherapeutic product in terms of quality, safety and efficacy.", "| United States | FDA | Follow-on biologic or biosimilar | A biological product that is highly similar to a US- licensed reference biological product notwithstanding minor differences in clinically inactive components, and for which there are no clinically meaningful differences between the biological product and the reference product in terms of the safety, purity, and potency of the product.", "| Canada | Health Canada | Subsequent-entry biologic | A biologic product that is similar to and would enter the market subsequent to an approved innovator biologic product.", "| Korea | MFDS | Biosimilar | Biological products which demonstrated its equivalence to an already approved reference product with regard to quality, safety, and efficacy.", "| Brazil | ANVISA | Biologic product | A biologic medicine with known biologic activity that contains no new molecules, already licensed in Brazil and that has gone through all the production steps (including formulation, vialing, freeze drying, labeling, packaging, storage, quality control and biologic product lot release.", "Abbreviations: ANVISA, Agencia de Vigilancia Sanitaria;

It’ll be a great way to continue or jump start your application process.", "We’ll have advisors on hand to answer questions, provide feedback on essay drafts, or talk about where to start.", "- 6 questions with…Justin Elkhechen ’15 (Amgen Scholars Program)", "1) How did you hear about the Amgen Scholars Program?", "My name is Justin N. Elkhechen and I participated in the Amgen Scholars Program at the Stanford University School of Medicine this past summer.", "The program provides undergraduate students from across the United States and Puerto Rico with opportunities to participate and engage in a summer research project under some of the world’s leading scientists.", "I initially heard about this program through a meeting with Kate Hanson, the Assistant Director of the Renée Crown University Honors Program.", "In addition, I also gained a first-person perspective on the program through the experiences of a fellow biochemistry major’s study at Columbia University.", "2) What was the most surprising aspect of your experience at Stanford University?", "During my time at Stanford University, one of the most surprising aspects was the size of the campus.", "Stanford University is, by acre, the largest college campus in the United States sitting on 8,183 acres.", "Moreover, it is the second largest in the world after Moscow State University. Thankfully, the program provided us with bicycles to get around, but even still biking from my house to the lab took about 10-15 minutes.", "In addition I was also fascinated by the architecture of the each building, including Hoover Tower, named after the 31st President, Herbert Hoover; this tower is the tallest building on campus.", "Founded in 1919, this building now serves as a library and archive to some of the world’s most important documents.", "Astonishingly, the archives contain more information on Italian fascism and Mussolini than Italy itself.", "3) Who was a particularly interesting person that you met?", "The Stanford University School of Medicine prospers in the presence of distinguished faculty members and Nobel laureates that have led, and continue to lead their respective fields of biomedicine.", "My research experience was under the mentorship of Dr. Marius Wernig and Dr. Sean Wu from both the Institute for Stem Cell Biology and Regenerative Medicine and the Cardiovascular Institute, respectively.", "As a result of this dual mentorship, I was able to regularly meet with Dr. Wernig, my primary Principal Investigator, in addition to Dr. Sean Wu, a current collaborator of Dr. Wernig.", "Dr. Wernig was the first to successfully convert fibroblasts directly to neurons, bypassing an induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) state.", "In addition, Dr. Sean Wu is one of the top leaders in his field, along with his colleague, Dr. Joseph Wu, and uses in-vitro culture of murine and human embryonic stem cells as a model to investigate cardiogenesis.", "I was very fortunate enough to be introduced and meet with all three of these professors this past summer.", "4) Tell us about your research there. What did your daily schedule look like?", "My research this summer was at the junction between neuroscience and cardiology. As a result of this collaboration between the two scientists, my time was spent in two laboratories.", "On average, I would spend about seven hours per day in the lab and go in five-to-six times per week. The goal of my study was to generate purkinje fiber-like cells in an effort to potentially provide regenerative therapies for patients suffering from cardiac arrhythmias, such as long-QT syndrome.", "Purkinje fibers are a group of specialized cardiomyocytes, or heart cells, that are responsible for the conduction system and are therefore needed to relay action potentials through the cardiovascular tissue.", "In a nutshell, we hypothesized that upon over-expression of a neurological transcription factor, Neurogenin 2 (Ngn2), in human iPSC-derived cardiomyocytes, we would be able to generate a hybrid cell that expresses proteins of both neuronal and cardiovascular cell types.", "As a preliminary result (as shown in the images below) we were able to see that these heart cells, upon over-expression of Ngn2, expressed both a major protein present in neurons, Tuj1 (stained red), and a major protein present in cardiac tissue, Cardiac Troponin T (cTnT – stained green).", "Whenever I was not in the lab, I made every effort to immerse myself in the vibrant California atmosphere.", "This immersion included many trips into San Francisco, which was only a train ride away. As an avid baseball fan, I was also able to watch the San Francisco Giants play against my hometown New York Yankees.", "Further, a major weekend trip that I took was to Calistoga, California, which is a small town present in the Napa Valley.", "Since I have some family in that area, they were able to take me around and show me the beautiful wine country.", "During this tour, we made a stop to the Old Faithful Geyser of California in Calistoga. After learning about how the geysers work, what I found extremely fascinating is that this geyser is currently being studied in order to investigate the connection between its eruptions and earthquakes.", "It has been seen that from two days to two weeks prior to an earthquake, the geyser provides “warning” by delaying its regular eruptions from the normal thirty-minute intervals to a longer interval.", "It has also been previously seen that during this prolonged interval, the geyser will not fully erupt, but send minor, small eruptions of 2-3 feet high per minute.", "In addition, the program also hosted all of the Amgen Scholars to a conference at the University of California, Los Angeles.", "At the conference, we were able to interact and discuss our research with all of the scholars across the country through small group meetings based on our field of study.", "Further, Amgen hosted all of the scholars to their headquarters in Thousand Oaks, CA. There we learned how the industry of biomedicine functions and listened to and participated in a multitude talks and workshops geared toward acclimating us to the life of a scientist.", "6) Any advice for SU students applying to the Amgen Scholars Program?", "One of the major aspects of the application process that I think must be make clear is to never self-select yourself out of a particular program, whether it be Amgen or any other scholarship, fellowship, or internship.", "I learned that the people reading your application look for many things other than GPA and quality research experience.", "After speaking to the other scholars, I learned that a few came from small schools that did not have the resources to carry out studies in the laboratory.", "However, if this may be the case, it is essential to elucidate your situation and the ways in which you will benefit from your experience.", "Further, it is also important to note that a major misconception about research is that you have to be in a laboratory; this is not always the case.", "Research is a broad term that can be carried out in a multitude of fashions; contributing to an unknown aspect of a field hallmarks the definition of research.", "A final piece of advice is to stay positive and work on your applications over the winter break. Putting together your application can be stressful, especially when trying to articulate under a word limit.", "That was what I found the most difficult, but by starting early this allowed for me to schedule enough meetings with advisors, the writing center, and peers to receive as much feedback as possible.", "7) Any ways that the program changed or influenced your future plans?", "Upon completion of the program, one of the major aspects of science research and medicine that I realized is that the degree, whether an M.D. or an M.D./Ph.", "D, does not make the individual; rather, the individual makes the degree. A struggle that I have dealt with is choosing whether to pursue an M.D./Ph.", "D or just an M.D. However, after my experience at Stanford, I realized that an M.D. can be just as multi-dimensional as a M.D./Ph.", "D. In fact, some principal investigators at the university just hold medical degrees. Furthermore, I was also able to speak to M.D.s at Amgen, who held positions solely within the industry, about how they dedicate their time strictly to medical research and how they transitioned from clinical careers into a research career.", "This program has opened my eyes to the versatility associated with both degrees and has tremendously lessened the stresses associated with making a decision on which programs to apply to."]}

Chief among them is Avastin, a cancer treatment that analysts project will eventually reach sales of $2 billion a year.", "A fourth drug, Tarceva, also for cancer, is expected to win approval by next year.", "Amgen, meanwhile, has relied for its runaway success mainly on two multibillion-dollar products introduced around 1990.", "One is Epogen, a red blood cell booster to treat anemia. The other is Neupogen, a white blood cell booster to treat a side effect of chemotherapy.", "Newer versions of those drugs are now propelling sales growth, and Amgen added a third billion-dollar product, the rheumatoid arthritis drug Enbrel, by acquiring its maker, Immunex, for $10 billion in 2002.", "But some analysts say that Amgen has not come up with significant, truly new products in a long time and they predict that its rapid growth will slow over the next few years.", "Amgen's stock, which traded over $70 briefly last summer, closed yesterday at $53.98.", "\"There's clearly a very stark contrast between the earnings multiples of the two companies,\" said Eric Schmidt, a biotechnology analyst at SG Cowen.", "\"I think there's no question that Genentech is going to grow at a much faster pace than Amgen in the next, three, five, six years.\"", "Of course investor sentiment can be fickle. Genentech's stock, which closed yesterday at $51.37, has come down from a recent peak of $68.25 in late April.", "The stock fell last week even after Genentech reported selling $133 million of Avastin in the second quarter, higher than analysts' expectations.", "Genentech last week also announced a setback in clinical trials for another cancer drug.", "The comparison of the two companies can be a bit unfair. It is easier for Genentech to grow faster because it is far smaller.", "Moreover, Genentech has been majority-owned by Roche since 1990. Amgen, by contrast, has become an independent, multinational company, on par with some of the more conventional pharmaceutical companies.", "But that achievement is hurting Amgen's stock because investors now sometimes lump it with the older pharmaceutical companies, which are growing more slowly than they once did.", "\"One of the criticisms I hear of Amgen is it's become a Big Pharma company,\" said Michael G. King Jr., an analyst with Banc of America Securities.", "He said he did not think that this was true, noting that Amgen was growing faster than the more traditional drug makers.", "The boundary between biotechnology and big pharmaceutical companies is fuzzy. Generally, though, biotechnology companies have concentrated on using genetic engineering to make proteins that can be used as drugs.", "The pharmaceutical companies tend to rely more on drugs made from chemicals.", "By almost any measure, both Amgen and Genentech remain remarkably successful. Combined, they account for about a third of the market capitalization of the publicly traded biotechnology industry, consisting of more than 300 companies.", "The next most valuable company, Biogen Idec, has a market capitalization of $21 billion.", "Executives at Amgen, based in Thousand Oaks, Calif., and Genentech of South San Francisco say they do not view each other as big rivals because their drugs rarely compete in the market.", "\"I think we have with Genentech, I hope we have, a mutual admiration society,\" Mr. Sharer said.", "Dr. Levinson said he did not see his company as Avis to Amgen's Hertz. Being No. 1, he said, is not his goal unless it reflects fundamental business success.", "\"If Pfizer bought Amgen we would be the biggest in biotech,\" he said. \"Would that make us feel good? No.\"", "Despite their protestations, the companies are now becoming direct rivals. Amgen's rheumatoid arthritis drug, Enbrel, was approved in April to also treat psoriasis, putting it in competition with Raptiva from Genentech.", "In turn, the cancer drug Rituxan from Genentech is being tested to treat rheumatoid arthritis. Both companies are making big pushes into new cancer drugs also, and they are increasingly competing to license promising drugs from smaller companies.", "Asked about Genentech's recent successes, Dr. Levinson said, \"There's an element of luck.\" But he added, \"We have an unusually rigorous process to assess the science of all our projects from the get-go.\"", "Genentech has patterned its research organization in part after academic institutions. It has its own postdoctoral program and observes campus traditions like parties on Friday afternoons.", "(On May 7, to celebrate its extraordinary year, it held a superparty in a parking lot, featuring performances by Elton John, Mary J. Blige and Matchbox Twenty.)", "The company's head of research, Richard H. Scheller, and his deputy, Marc Tessier-Lavigne, were Stanford professors with no real corporate experience until joining Genentech in 2001 and 2003, respectively.", "\"Our mantra is: Let the science direct us,\" Dr. Tessier-Lavigne said.", "Genentech's scientists are given discretionary time to work on projects of their own interest.

The predawn hours at Juncos were punctuated by minor emergencies, recalls Kerry Ingalls, vice president of site operations for Amgen Manufacturing, who runs the site.", "Like every big company, Amgen has a detailed business continuity plan meant to provide guidance for the minutiae of every disaster.", "But, as Ingalls puts it plainly, “Crises don’t follow the script. Weird things happen.”", "Like, for example, when fire alarms start ringing simultaneously in three separate buildings. It happened at 6 AM, at the height of the storm, and Ingalls was able to quickly assess that two were false alarms.", "But the third, in AML1, the oldest building on-site, appeared real. Using cameras to search around the building, the team could see that the roof had partially collapsed, triggering a water-flow alarm in the process.", "The lack of a fire was a relief, but nothing could be done about the damage.", "Meanwhile, the waterproof seal protecting the administrative building where most staff had congregated began to leak, so even those huddled in a conference room on the third floor had to slosh around.", "Between that and flooding elsewhere in the building, employees scrambled to divert water to the cafeteria, sacrificing it to preserve offices and other essentials on the first floor.", "By 2 PM, Ingalls felt confident enough to go out in a security truck and get a first assessment of the damage.", "Maria was by then making an exit at the northern border of the island. Debris was everywhere, some trees were flattened, and water had seeped into buildings across the campus, but Ingalls was pleased to find that, aside from the one roof, buildings had held up well.", "In the distance, El Yunque was almost unrecognizable. The storm had denuded the trees, turning the typically verdant landscape into a splotch of brown.", "As Maria made its way toward the mainland U.S., Puerto Rico was coming to terms with the magnitude of the disaster.", "Flooding, mudslides, and flying debris had destroyed tens of thousands of houses and blocked roads across the island.", "The challenges were magnified by the double-whammy loss of power and loss of communication systems. People were cut off from help at the time they needed it most.", "Beyond the lives lost as a direct cause of the hurricane’s force, recent assessments conclude that thousands more perished in the days and months after the storm.", "As crisis management teams at Amgen and other pharma sites across the island began to take stock of the damage, they balanced a number of priorities: making sure all their employees were safe and assessing their needs while coming up with a plan that would allow sites to get back up and running as quickly as possible.", "Among their first tasks was to track down employees—thousands of them. Some lived in areas made impassable by downed trees and light posts or a fallen bridge.", "The gravity of the situation was difficult for those outside Puerto Rico to grasp. Ingalls would phone into headquarters by satellite phone and mention that he was working hard to account for all his employees, “and they’d say, ‘Well, why don’t you just post something to Facebook?’ ”", "he recalls with equal measures of amusement and exasperation.", "It took Amgen nearly a month to find everyone. Many companies, like Johnson & Johnson, which took 23 days to account for its roughly 3,700 people who work at six plants across five municipalities on the island, began going door to door to find the last employees on its list.", "Some were easy to find; they showed up at the gates a few days after the storm, ready to work. Amgen, like every other pharma firm, had broadcast messages on multiple radio stations to let employees know that only essential staff would be needed.", "But on Monday morning, when José Vidal, at the time the vice president of drug substance operations at Amgen, made his way to Juncos, he found hundreds of employees lined up, ready to work.", "Similar scenes were unfolding at drug sites across the island.", "The lines of workers also drove home the desperation to return to normal life. Although the Juncos site had enough backup power to be fully operational—and one microbial production line continued running for several days after the storm—it was nowhere near ready to spring back into the everyday routine.", "“That’s when it got really emotionally bad for us,” Vidal recalls. “Seeing your colleagues—your friends, right?—who are day in and out with you, and they had no food or gas, and you had to tell them, ‘You have to go back home.’", "Home to some 50 pharmaceutical manufacturing sites, Puerto Rico is a key component of the global pharmaceutical manufacturing chain.", "1 Juncos: Amgen's Juncos site is the largest in its manufacturing network, with roughly 2,700 people working across its five plants to produce 13 of the company's drugs.", "2 Las Piedras: Merck & Co., which employs roughly 600 people on the island, shipped over a 1,500-kW generator from its West Point, Pa., site to support operations in Las Piedras.", "3 Jayuya: Many employees living near Abbvie's site in Jayuya were still without power 11 months after the hurricane.", "4 Barceloneta: Abbvie's Barceloneta site benefited from a cogeneration plant, which allowed it to power another company and the local bakery after the storm.", "5 Vega Baja Pfizer's Vega Baja site, one of three that collectively employ about 1,900 people plus contractors, packed its first batch of medicines on Nov. 2nd, about six weeks after the storm.", "6 Guaynabo J&J's Guaynabo site, home to corporate and commercial functions, is part of a broad network on the island, with some 3,700 employees working across six manufacturing sites.", "7 Carolina Eli Lilly & Co. is one of six companies to manufacture biologic products, like the insulin made at its Carolina site.", "One of the big lessons that pharma site leaders learned in the aftermath of Maria was that “aside from the buildings and products, the first thing we needed to manage was establishing society,” Vidal says.", "“Everything was chaos, so we needed to establish order within the confines of Juncos. There was a bubble where you should feel normal, you should follow some rules, you have shelter.”", "Carlos Martis, site leader at AbbVie’s Jayuya site, recalls everyone’s shock when, just days after the storm, an employee who had lost her dad in a landslide appeared at the gate.", "The funeral home wasn’t open yet, and until then, she told Martis, “I just need to work. I need to reestablish my world,” he recalls.", "The first step of reestablishing order was to mitigate, as much as possible, the humanitarian crisis unfolding across the island.", "Site leaders, coordinating with crisis teams at headquarters on the mainland, worked to quickly assess and, where possible, address the needs of their staff.", "But with relief personnel and aid rightfully taking priority at the airport and ports, getting supplies in—and, later, pharmaceutical products out—was a logistical nightmare.", "Before the storm, J&J had set aside supplies at a warehouse in Jacksonville, Fla., just in case. The company managed to pack them onto a flight that reached San Juan two days after the storm.", "When the truck carrying pallets of water and other relief items pulled into the loading dock of the company’s Guaynabo site at 3 AM on Friday, executives—and their families, who had been hunkered down with them—were reinvigorated.", "“The level of satisfaction when we saw that truck—that made a whole difference in the world,” Ernesto Lugo, global senior director for risk and crisis management at J&J, says with a wide smile.", "That shipment would be the first of 27 flights and 20 ocean containers carrying emergency supplies sent by J&J.", "By the third week, Amgen had set up “Camp Phoenix,” an ad hoc assembly of temporary shelters and tents to distribute aid.", "The amenities offered went far beyond just the basics of potable water and food. Dozens of washers and dryers were set up, and employees could drop off two bags of clothes per week.", "Staff could take a hot shower—a true luxury—or eat a hot meal. Amgen also brought in ice makers, and employees took home bag after bag to help keep food, and more critically, medicines, from going bad.", "A gas station set up on the north end of the site saved employees from queuing for hours to fill up their tanks to get to and from work.", "“We decided we were going to make this site an oasis for the staff where we help give them the tools to not only take care of their families but to help us get the site back.", "To enable both, really,” Ingalls says. He jokes that the site had everything but a barbershop, an amenity the former Navy captain continues to be perplexed was left out, “because I love getting haircuts.”", "That concept was repeated at pharma sites across the island. As more employees began returning to work, childcare was set up to account for the many schools and day-care facilities that were knocked out of commission.", "Collectively, companies shipped thousands of generators and gas stoves for employees from the mainland at a time when it was otherwise impossible to track one down on the island.", "They provided such basic services for months. While some people got power back within six weeks, many more living in the communities surrounding these big drug manufacturing sites went without for months.", "In early August, nearly a year after Maria, a substantial number of workers at AbbVie’s site in Jayuya, a small town that sits at the highest point on the island, still had no electricity.", "“Many people talked about how being here at work was not the reality—it was a luxury at the time,” says David Thompson, general manager at AbbVie’s Barceloneta site.", "“We had air-conditioning, we had communication, we had running water, hot food. And you can work. When people left to go back home, it was a different life.”", "Creating a safe space for employees was a crucial element to restoring drug manufacturing to normal levels, pharma site leaders readily admit.", "Executives were keenly aware of the need to get operations back up and running as quickly and with as much stability as possible, for the benefit of global drug supplies as well as Puerto Rico.", "Of the top 20 medicines sold worldwide, components of 11 are manufactured on the island. The drug supply chain has some flexibility—companies can shift manufacturing to sites in other countries, for example—but the portion of the pipeline potentially affected by Maria risked bottom lines as well as the overall pharmaceutical supply chain.", "The stakes were high for Puerto Rico itself too: As of 2016, the drug and devices industry represented nearly 30% of its overall gross domestic product, and some 38,000 people worked in the biosciences.", "As media began to report the outages at plants on the island, and U.S. Food & Drug Administration Commissioner Scott Gottlieb issued statements on the issue, worries over drug shortages heightened.", "Even as sites began to feel more stable than the outside world, executives knew that order was fragile.", "Site leaders took extreme measures to keep things on track. For example, Amgen’s four senior vice presidents, which included Vidal and Ingalls, took on 24-to-48-hour shifts to ensure that someone would always be at the site in case of an emergency.", "“It proved to be a very helpful and wise decision because every night after the hurricane, for the next four or five weeks, something happened,” inevitably at 2 or 3 AM, Vidal notes wryly.", "That routine lasted about 40 days. Vidal was a lucky one: His office carpeting had remained dry even at the height of the storm, so he had a reasonable place to sleep.", "Ingalls took to crashing on the large U-shaped table in the main conference room. At first, he was avoiding the wet floor, but colleagues say he stuck to that spot even after the carpeting had aired out—the former Navy officer’s time on submarines must have conditioned him for uncomfortable situations.", "During that frenetic period, site managers had to close gaps in companies’ seemingly meticulous business continuity plans.", "Among the issues laid bare by the storm was the widespread assumption that communications and operations would continue so long as power was on.", "Everyone planned for plants to run according to paper versions of the standard operating procedures.", "Amgen’s Juncos site, however, didn’t have printed versions on hand, and flooding of the site’s main computer control room severed its connection to servers in California.", "The makeshift solution was for a team at the company’s headquarters in Thousand Oaks, Calif., to print out the paperwork and fly it over to the island.", "“These guys spent 48 hours in rotations continuously printing documents,” says Vidal, who happened to be in Thousand Oaks when Maria hit.", "When he and colleagues from Juncos returned to San Juan four days after the storm on Amgen’s corporate jet, they took along a half-dozen boxes of documents.", "Lack of internet access also meant that inventory couldn’t be tracked. “Not having that connectivity to systems kind of prevented operations from starting up,” J&J’s Lugo says.", "Perhaps the most critical situation in Juncos and for several other biologics manufacturing sites across the island was a shortage of high-purity gases.", "Site leaders found themselves in a real bind. Those delicate cell lines need oxygen and nitrogen to survive.", "“Without oxygen, you’re dead in the water—no product, and millions of dollars in waste,” Vidal says. The storm put companies’ suppliers out of commission, and any oxygen that made its way to the port was diverted to hospitals.", "The situation reportedly became so dire that according to sources, one company risked losing $200 million in material as it got down to its last two days of oxygen.", "In that moment, the island’s size—just 160 by 56 km, as everyone is quick to tell visitors—began to work in its favor.", "The life sciences community is exceptionally tight, and soon, Amgen executives found themselves working with their counterparts at AbbVie and Becton, Dickinson & Co. to share their dwindling supplies and source gases.", "“We ended up having to work externally to bring material in from Europe and the U.S.,” AbbVie’s Thompson says.", "He adds that although they were competitors, “work between companies was tremendous and, I think, unique to Puerto Rico.”", "The first thing any drug company executive sitting down to discuss Maria and its aftermath will say is, “This was a 100-year event.”", "The last time the island witnessed a storm anywhere close to this magnitude was Hurricane Georges, a Category 3 storm that struck in 1998.", "Although well versed in the statistics, the executives concede that a changing climate could bring more Marias more often.", "The question is whether drug companies can ever prepare enough to mitigate the next big storm—and avoid potentially disastrous drug shortages.", "The question is fair, but it should be broadened beyond Puerto Rico or even hurricanes more generally, says James Bruno, president of the consulting firm Chemical & Pharmaceutical Solutions.", "“You can’t really schedule” a natural disaster, and they come in all shapes and forms, he says. For example, when Eyjafjallajökull erupted in Iceland in 2010, the weeks-long disruption to air travel reverberated across the pharmaceutical industry.", "Companies had to scramble to ship drugs from Ireland, one of the other critical manufacturing hubs, to ports in France and the Mediterranean for global distribution.", "“The cost of eliminating the risk is going to be so astronomical, none of us could afford it,” he says.", "“We’d have to put up superstructures that can defy anything—volcanoes, earthquakes.”", "Moreover, no two disasters unfold in the same way, making it impossible to fully predict and prepare for every possible scenario.", "Even for Puerto Rico, “If a hurricane were to come through again, I can’t tell you that the island or the site would be exactly the same, you know, two hours after the storm’s gone,” Ingalls says.", "That’s not to say that in the wake of Maria, drug companies have maintained the status quo. Manufacturers identified several key areas where improvements have already been made or are being planned.", "The two biggest changes to big pharma firms’ planning for this and future disasters are in developing more robust communications and power systems.", "No one expected communications to be down at all, let alone for months. “We had some satellite phones that sometimes worked, that sometimes didn’t, depending on if it was too cloudy or if there were interruptions or blockages,” J&J’s Lugo says.", "J&J has since revised its basic telecommunications requirements for each facility and is creating backups for the backups.", "In addition to satellite phones, sites now have high-frequency radios, microwave technology, and satellite dishes.", "“In case something like this ever happens again, at least we have some better tools to communicate,” Lugo says.", "Other companies are responding similarly. “The majority of the changes we have made to business-continuity plans for readiness, during an event, and recovery were based on ‘What if we don’t have communication channels?’ ” says Lourdes Colón, vice president of operations at Eli Lilly & Co.’s manufacturing site in Carolina, P.R.", "AbbVie’s communications upgrades mirror those at J&J, and the company is also working on developing a concept it calls “plant in a box.”", "“We either have local servers or images on our local servers of everything that is necessary to be able to run our quality systems, our maintenance system, our production system within the plant without connectivity” beyond the site, Thompson says.", "Sites have additionally bolstered backup power systems. Everyone had backup generators, but no one anticipated the strain put on them.", "When Hurricane Irma arrived two weeks before Maria, Amgen’s Juncos site ran on diesel generators for nearly a week.", "“It set a new site record—six straight days,” Ingalls says. “And then comes Maria, and we were on diesels for over 120 days straight with no interruptions in site operations due to power.”", "“I’m not talking about just keeping the warehouse cold,” Ingalls emphasizes. “I’m talking about everybody at work, all factories operating at full production on diesel power.”", "Amgen has since invested $40 million in a cogeneration (cogen) plant, an efficient system that provides both heat and power, that is expected to be operational later this year.", "Pfizer has also added more generators and is investing in a cogeneration unit at its Vega Baja site. The additions will give it full redundancy, says Sigfrido García, the facility’s director of competitiveness, technology, and business development.", "AbbVie’s Barceloneta site was one of the few that already had a cogen unit, which allowed it after the storm to power not just its own operations but also an adjacent manufacturer and a local bakery.", "But AbbVie is now installing two more cogen units plus other backup generators at its sites. “We have the redundancy of the redundancy,” Martis says with a grin.", "Companies are also working with the Puerto Rican government in hopes of improving the coordination of relief efforts during future events.", "Executives note that, unlike during Maria, the government has now established a central location, a Sheraton hotel in San Juan, to house agencies like the Federal Emergency Management Agency and the Department of Homeland Security.", "That will give companies an immediate one-stop shop for help.", "Meanwhile, they are also pushing the government to have a better plan for bringing in aid as well as the supplies needed for businesses to run as usual.", "After Maria, “the backlog of containers at the port was huge and lasted weeks, if not months,” says Rafael Castro, vice president of operations for the Pharmaceutical Industry Association of Puerto Rico.", "That traffic jam “really hindered both the emergency rescue operations and the recovery operations.” One possible solution under discussion is to maintain regular goods at the port in San Juan and shift emergency supplies to another port, possibly in Ponce or Mayagüez.", "Another area that companies are addressing is contingency plans for external suppliers. Big companies themselves might have managed to create an oasis after the storm, but the situation for critical suppliers—the medical gas companies, for example—was more dire.", "“We’ve looked hard into changing some of our business-continuity approaches to take into account the fact that we are on an island,” Amgen’s Ingalls says.", "“Maybe the backup needs to come from off the island, not somewhere else on the island.” After all, “it doesn’t matter how many backups you have if everyone’s affected by the same crisis.”", "Bruno of Chemical & Pharmaceutical Solutions agrees that companies should be taking a closer look across their entire supply chain and adjusting their business contingency plans.", "The smaller cogs in the elaborate pharmaceutical manufacturing machinery could mean the difference between supply continuity or shortage.", "“I don’t think people realize how vulnerable we are in the United States for drug shortages,” Bruno says.", "Even as pharmaceutical site managers who led their teams through Maria and its aftermath acknowledge planning weaknesses, they fiercely defend their sector’s strengths.", "The pharmaceutical supply chain did not grind to a halt. They point out that aside from one manufacturer that had preexisting issues, the global flow of drugs or devices was steady.", "Companies were back to running some or all parts of their facilities on average within two weeks, a statistic everyone is quick to cite.", "That was due in part to strict manufacturing requirements by FDA. “We complain every year about all these inspections and how tough they are, but it paid back for us,” Amgen’s Vidal says, adding that companies “were in such a state of compliance” that the right procedures were in place to bounce back after the hurricane.", "Nearly a year out and fully immersed in yet another hurricane season, employees are still emotional when talking about the events and lessons of Maria.", "They say they are personally better prepared this time around—everyone has their generator tucked away and plenty of supplies on hand just in case.", "At least while the memory is fresh, no one is going to underestimate another storm.", "And at Amgen, employees are hoping for a more formal memorial. The roof that collapsed and set off a fire alarm at the height of the storm had sheltered one of the site’s original buildings.", "That exposed area has been razed, leaving the concrete foundation as a large, bare rectangle that employees call Maria Plaza.", "They hope it will be turned into a lasting tribute to what they endured, together."]}

It allows for these four states to be incorporated into the EU’s single market.", "As Switzerland is not also a member of the EEA (the Swiss rejected the idea in 1992), it has its own bilateral agreements with the EU, which took two years to finalise and cover all areas from trade to transport.", "The complexities of applying a similar model to the UK would therefore engender momentous negotiations.", "‘Switzerland may guard its political and cultural independence fiercely, but its scientific sector has a strongly international flavour’", "Switzerland is a rich country and that is partly thanks to its pharmaceutical industry, which is geared towards high value exports and supported by expert research.", "Switzerland is home to some of the world’s most successful pharmaceutical companies, such as Novartis and Roche, and noted for its scientific and academic institutions.", "Despite not being an EU member state, Switzerland has also benefitted from EU FPs, such as Horizon 2020, which offer grants for research.", "The UK also has a strong reputation in the areas of science and research, and has received proportionately high funds through these programme (£67 billion alone through Horizon 2020).", "In fact, the UK receives more funding from the European Research Council than any other EU country and has priority access to scientific facilities across Europe, putting it at risk of losing a predicted £8.5 billion over the next four years [54].", "Industry similarities and Switzerland’s economic success outside of the EU makes it unsurprising that many leave campaigners are championing a Swiss-inspired model as Brexit negotiations take shape.", "However, it seems highly unlikely that the EU will facilitate furthering these aspirations; in 2010, it was already referring to a relationship with Switzerland “which has become complex and unwieldy to manage and has clearly reached its limits”", "In addition, leave campaigners are motivated by what they view as Switzerland’s privileged position in terms of its unique relationship with the EU, yet many of them overlook the fact that the Swiss model aligns with many EU structures, laws and values.", "For example, in 1999, Switzerland accepted free movement of persons. Recently, Switzerland did indeed act to reinstate quotas on foreign workers.", "However, it was effectively punished by the EU which froze its Horizon 2020 grants and stalled its Erasmus + student mobility scheme [56].", "This is a strong indication of the likelihood of failure if the UK attempts to negotiate entirely on its own terms.", "Debate on this subject points to a third solution for the UK post-Brexit, that of the WTO, which is in fact the model that the UK will automatically revert to on exiting the EU [52].", "This would be the most drastic option whereby the UK would abandon its European premise and use the established trade rules and norms of the WTO to forge bilateral trade agreements with the EU, resulting in a model similar to the rest of the world (that includes tariffs on trade with the EU, customs taxes etc.)", "This option could potentially offer the UK flexibility and the clean slate that leave campaigners rooted for, but it is the most ambiguous at this stage and would likely take many years to implement.", "For example, the UK could theoretically follow Canada which, after seven years of negotiations, signed the EU-Canada Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement (CETA) in 2013 and now profits from 98% tariff-free trade with the EU.", "Vicky Ford (Conservative MEP and Chair of the European Parliament Committee for the Internal Market and Consumer Protection) has stated that it is “much more important to look at the so called ‘non-tariff barriers’ which reflect the bureaucratic red tape faced by companies exporting into other markets and to recognise that the level of ease British companies currently have when selling into other EU markets is much, much greater than that which is now offered to Canada in CETA”", "It should also be asked: is it really appropriate to compare the UK to Norway and Switzerland when demographically and economically these are very different nations?", "The former has a population of 5.1 million, the latter’s is 8.2 million.

Lederman, 355 F.3d 1343 (Fed.", "Cir. 2004), had claims drawn to human CD40CR antibodies and mammalian CD40CR antibodies, but the original disclosure only described and claimed mouse CD40CR antibodies.", "Here, the court applied the standard set in Lilly and ruled that patent applicant’s specific, narrow disclosure of mouse antigen was not sufficient to support a patent claim for a more generic scope of coverage for CD40CR antibodies (especially when it comes to other species).", "The court held that antibody claims must be fully characterized for there to be proper written description, noting that “as long as applicant has disclosed a fully characterized antigen, either by its structure, formula, chemical name, or physical properties, or by deposit of the antibody in a public depository, the applicant can then claim an antibody by its binding affinity to that described antigen” (15).", "RECENT DEVELOPMENTS IN THE LAW OF OBVIOUSNESS THAT COULD IMPACT PATENTING IN THE FIELD OF VETERINARY MEDICINE", "Background on the Development of the Law Pertaining to Obviousness", "In the U.S., the law pertaining to obviousness is codified in 35 U.S.C. § 103, which provides in pertinent part:", "A patent may not be obtained… if the differences between the subject matter sought to be patented and the prior art are such that the subject matter as a whole would have been obvious at the time the invention was made to a person having ordinary skill in the art…", "In the case of Graham v John Deere, 383 U.S. 1 (1966), the U.S. Supreme Court set out the following three steps for assessing whether the subject matter of a patent claim is obvious:", "Ascertain the differences between the prior art and claims at issue, and", "Assess the level of ordinary skill in the pertinent art.", "Beyond this basic three-step test, the Supreme Court also noted that, where relevant, secondary considerations such as the following could also be used:", "Long felt but unsolved need for the present invention, and", "Graham v Deere remained the seminal case on obviousness throughout the four decades since its issuance.", "In recent years, however, criticism grew that the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit (the main appeals court in patent cases) was interpreting the Graham v Deere test in a way that unfairly raised the bar for parties trying to invalidate patents.", "In particular, the Federal Circuit Court was criticized for rigidly requiring parties to demonstrate a specific “teaching, suggestion, or motivation” to combine references when alleging obviousness (a test often referred to as the “TSM” test).", "The issue of the TSM test was finally argued at the Supreme Court on November 28, 2006, in the much-anticipated case of KSR International v. Teleflex (16).", "In KSR, the question before the Supreme Court was whether a claimed invention can be obvious, and therefore unpatentable under 35 U.S.C. 103(a), without proof of some “teaching, suggestion, or motivation” to modify or combine the prior art in the manner claimed.", "KSR (the accused infringer) argued that the claimed invention of the patent in suit (the combination of a known adjustable gas pedal with a known electronic throttle control) merely represented an obvious combination of existing devices.", "In response, the party asserting the patent (Teleflex) argued that the Federal Circuit case law pertaining to obviousness required a party to demonstrate a specific teaching, suggestion or motivation to combine reference teachings, and in this case there was no evidence of a specific teaching, suggestion or motivation to combine the known gas pedal with the known electronic control.", "On April 30, 2007, the Supreme Court issued its decision reversing the Federal Circuit’s “rigid” approach and finding that the claimed combination was obvious.", "Noting that courts should be free to take account of the “inferences and creative steps that a person of ordinary skill in the art would employ,” the Supreme Court held that the analysis of obviousness “need not seek out precise teachings directed to the specific subject matter of the challenged claim” (17).", "In reaching its decision, the Supreme Court pointed out that courts do not have to ignore common sense, observing that “familiar items may have obvious uses beyond their primary purposes, and in many cases a person of ordinary skill will be able to fit the teachings of multiple patents together like pieces of a puzzle” (18).", "At the same time, the Court was cognizant that patent examiners and other parties asserting obviousness of a claimed invention should not be allowed to use hindsight to link two distant references together without any reasonable basis to do so.", "Accordingly, the Court cautioned that assertions of obviousness “cannot be sustained by mere conclusory statements; instead, there must be some articulated reasoning with some rational underpinning to support the legal conclusion of obviousness”.", "See KSR International Co. v.

Ct. 1727, 1741 (2007) (quoting In re Kahn, 441 F. 3d 977, 988 (Fed.", "On May 3, 2007, three days after the KSR decision, the Deputy Commissioner for Patent Operations at the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) issued an interim statement noting, inter alia, that:", "“The Supreme Court in KSR did not totally reject the use of ‘teaching, suggestion, or motivation’ as a factor in the obviousness analysis.", "Rather, the Court recognized that a showing of ‘teaching, suggestion, or motivation’ to combine the prior art to meet the claimed subject matter could provide a helpful insight in determining whether the claimed subject matter is obvious” (19).", "“The Court rejected a rigid application of the ‘teaching, suggestion, or motivation’ (TSM) test” (19).", "“The Court noted that the analysis supporting a rejection under 35 U.S.C. §103(a) should be made explicit, and that it was ‘important to identify a reason that would have prompted a person of ordinary skill in the relevant field to combine the (prior art) elements’ in the manner claimed” (19).", "In view of this last point, the Deputy Commissioner’s interim statement concluded that:", "“in formulating a rejection under 35 U.S.C. §103(a) based upon a combination of prior art elements, it remains necessary for patent examiners to identify the reason why a person of ordinary skill in the art would have combined the prior art elements in the manner claimed” (19).", "Although the technology at issue in the KSR case related to the design of auto parts, the Supreme Court’s ruling on the issue of obviousness is expected to shape the future of patenting in the life sciences.", "In particular, one can anticipate that it will be now become easier to argue that a patent claim is obvious.", "Furthermore, to rebut a “prima facie” case of obviousness, patent applicants in the future will likely have to meet a higher standard of proof and likely need to rely on strong evidence, such as:", "Test data or other tangible evidence showing unexpectedly improved properties;", "Test data or other tangible evidence showing that the claimed invention has unforeseeable properties not found in the prior art;", "Arguments or evidence that the prior art shows a bias against trying the newly claimed combination.", "In Europe, where “obviousness” is known as “lack of inventive step” under the European Patent Convention (EPC), the case law has undergone its own unique evolution with respect to how the issue is analyzed.", "In general, the evaluation of “inventive step” in Europe starts with the identification of the “closest prior art” and the “technical problem to be solved”.", "This is then followed by an analysis of whether the technical solution to the problem represents an unexpected or “non-obvious” advance over the “closest prior art” (when combined with either a second prior art reference or common general knowledge in the relevant art).", "A thorough review of the European case law on inventive step can be found in Case Law of the Boards of Appeal of the European Patent Office, pp.", "120–168 (5th Ed. 2006) (20). With particular regard to the life sciences, it is worth noting cases such as Modifying Plant Cells/MYCOGEN (T 694/92; OJ EPO 1997, 408), Vaccines/GENENTECH (T 187/93; 1997), and Triazole/ AGREVO (T 939/92 OJ EPO 1996/309), where there is an interesting interplay between the “inventive step” requirement of Article 56 EPC and the “sufficiency of disclosure” requirement of Article 83 EPC.", "In particular, these cases show that it has been the practice of the European Patent Office, under the so-called “problem and solution” approach, to evaluate whether or not the problem in a given case has been solved across the full scope of the claims, and then to limit a patent proprietor’s claims to a scope commensurate with the proprietor’s actual contribution to the art.", "Examples of Special Situations in the Field of Veterinary Medicine Where the Issue of Obviousness Could Come Into Play", "When evaluating obviousness under the patent laws, some of the more interesting situations that could arise in the veterinary field are ones involving “cross-species” scenarios.", "These are situations where the therapeutic use of a given active ingredient or class of active ingredients is already known in one animal species, and the new invention will use the same active ingredient (or a member of the known class of active ingredients) in a second animal species (e.g., a situation where it is known to use Drug X in a dog and the claimed invention is to use the same Drug X in a cat; or a situation where it is known to use a specific class of drugs in humans and the claimed invention is to use a particular member of this class of drugs in an animal).", "In situations such as these, the most favorable scenario for the patent applicant is where the prior art publications teach, or at least suggest, an actual bias against using the therapeutic in the newly claimed species of animal.", "A hypothetical example of this scenario would be as follows:", "The prior art shows that a certain class of compounds can be used successfully in dogs, but several compounds within this class have previously been shown not to work in cats (or better yet for the patent applicant, were toxic in cats), and", "The new invention is the paradoxical finding that a novel compound within the known class of compounds turns out to be perfectly safe and effective in cats.", "This type of favorable prior art landscape is sometimes referred to among patent practitioners as a “teaching away” or a “prejudice” in the art and will usually be the easiest argument to make if a patent applicant is fortunate enough to have such a favorable prior art landscape as the backdrop for the newly claimed invention (in this case, a novel compound with surprising properties).", "The more difficult situation is where the prior art shows use of a compound or class of compounds in multiple species of animals and the new invention is in a species of animal where the drug or class of drugs has not yet been tried.", "In situations such as these, the patent applicant should attempt to identify a reason why there might be a bias not to use the drug in the new species.", "To support such an argument, the applicant should show (preferably through the use of strong data) that the claimed invention yields surprising or unexpectedly superior results such that one of ordinary skill in the art at the time would not have had a reasonable expectation of such success in the new animal species.", "For examples of “cross-species” scenarios, reference can be made to U.S. Patent No. 6,716,423 and U.S. Patent No. 5,750,112.", "U.S. Patent 6,716,423 relates to methods of vaccinating a cow against a particular pathogen, Neospora, which was first isolated and identified in dogs, while U.S. Patent 5,750,112 relates to a canine coronavirus vaccine employing a feline enteric coronavirus.", "In the case of U.S. Patent 5,750,112, there was prior art showing that cross-protective studies with feline enteric coronavirus offered little protection in certain heterologous species (e.g., in pigs), thus providing a bias in the prior art against cross-species efficacy.", "Among other things, the patent applicant argued that the art of developing vaccines to prevent canine corona virus infections in dogs was unpredictable based on the antigenical relationship of the coronaviradae viruses.", "POTENTIAL ISSUES RELATED TO PATENTS COVERING ASSAYS", "An interesting issue with potential application to the veterinary medicine field concerns the question of patents in the area of assays for analyzing the effects of drugs.", "In the U.S. and many other countries in the world, it is well established that assays and methods of carrying out assays can properly be the subject matter of patents (provided all the standard criteria of patentability are met).", "Thus, in a situation where a patentee has been granted claims covering an assay which is required by a regulatory agency to be used in connection with the administration of a given therapy, a question could arise as to what kind of remedies—such as lost profits, reasonable royalties, injunctive relief, etc.—the patentee could be entitled to receive if the claimed assay is indeed carried out by other parties in order to comply with regulatory requirements.", "With regard to clinical testing during the drug approval process, there is often a valid exception to infringement under Section 271(e)(1) of the U.S. Patent Statute (21).", "Section 271(e)(1) provides a “safe harbor” exemption from patent infringement for “uses reasonably related to the development and submission of information under a Federal law which regulates...drugs or veterinary biological products,” and this special exemption has been given a fairly broad interpretation under recent case law.(22)", "However, once a party commercializes a therapeutic, that party can no longer use the Section 271(e)(1) exemption as a defense.", "It also would not be a defense simply to say that it is the clinician or veterinarian who is the infringer and not the company that supplies the therapeutic product.", "This is because the company selling the product commercially could be accused of inducing infringement under 35 U.S.C. § 271(b) or contributing to infringement under 35 U.S.C. § 271(c).", "Although it is beyond the scope of this article to speculate on how all this might be played out in court and what remedies might or might not be available, there are some court cases that may be of interest in this analysis.", "See, e.g., Hybritech Inc. v. Abbott Laboratories, 849 F. 2d. 1446 (Fed. Cir. 1988), where the defendant’s infringing cancer and hepatitis test kits were not included in the preliminary injunction order against the defendant since the patentee did not offer such kits and there were no other suppliers at the time.", "Moreover, the U.S. Supreme Court has recently issued a landmark decision on remedies in patent infringement cases, ruling there is no longer a “general rule” in patent cases that courts will almost always issue permanent injunctions against infringement.", "Specifically, in eBay, Inc. v. MercExchange, L.L.C, 547 U.S. __, 126 S. Ct. 1837 (2006), the Supreme Court held that in patent cases, like all other types of cases, permanent injunctions can only be issued where the remedy is appropriate in light of equitable principles.", "This means that the remedy must be assessed under the well-established four-factor test used in all other cases, whereby a plaintiff/patentee seeking a permanent injunction is required to show that:", "Standard legal remedies such as monetary damages are inadequate to compensate for the injury,", "A permanent injunction is warranted in view of the balance of hardships (between patentee and infringer), and", "A permanent injunction would not be against the public interest.", "Thus, with particular regard to the fourth factor, the more an accused infringer can argue that injunctive relief is against the public interest (e.g., the accused product is a lifesaving cure that is not available from any other source), the greater chance there is under the new case law that a judge might refuse to order an injunction (despite infringement of a valid patent).", "Within the field of veterinary pharmaceuticals, this issue has a unique twist. When a drug is approved for use in food-producing animals, residue limits and withdrawal times are established to ensure the safety of the animal-derived food (e.g., eggs, milk, and meat) for human consumption.", "The component of the application that establishes human food safety must contain an analytical method that has been properly validated.", "The performance characteristics of that method are then integrated into the establishment of a withdrawal time (i.e., the time between the last dose and when the animal-derived food product is considered to be safe for human consumption).", "Interestingly, although the analytical method would be considered as part of the product dossier, the analytical method becomes an integral component of the drug monitoring program and must be the method used by any laboratory involved in the monitoring of food for “violative residues”.", "Furthermore, in legal proceedings in the U.S. associated with prosecuting parties for marketing drug-tainted food, data generated using the FDA-approved analytical method are relied upon to support the prosecutions (23,24).", "SITUATIONS WHERE THERE ARE ACTUAL DIFFERENCES IN THE LAW IN THE CASE OF VETERINARY MEDICINE", "In research compiled for this article, very few examples have been uncovered where there are actual differences in the law per se when it comes to the veterinary field.", "Perhaps the most interesting examples can be found in the area of U.S. law pertaining to patent term restoration and the interplay of this area of patent law with U.S. regulatory law as embodied in the so-called “Hatch–Waxman Act” (in the field of human medicine) and the Generic Animal Drug and Patent Term Restoration Act (in the field of veterinary medicine).", "Overview of the Hatch–Waxman Act and the Generic Animal Drug and Patent Term Restoration Act (GADPTR)", "The original Hatch–Waxman legislation was passed in 1984 as a compromise between pioneer pharmaceutical companies and generic companies.", "The pioneer companies were concerned that they were spending enormous sums of money to develop each new drug, yet the duration of time from drug discovery to commercialization was often more than 10 years—thereby eroding valuable patent term.", "The generic companies, on the other hand, argued that they could not get on the market until years after the patent expiration.", "This was because of the famous 1984 case, Roche v. Bolar, 733 F.2d 858 (Fed. Cir. 1984), which held that testing and development in pursuit of regulatory approval constituted infringement even though the generic company was willing to wait for the patent to expire before commercializing the product.", "These developments provided the foundation for the Hatch–Waxman legislation, whereby generic companies were given the benefit of earlier entry possibilities in exchange for pioneer companies being able to retrieve, to a limited extent, some of the lost years of valuable patent life that were unused due to the regulatory approval process.", "In 1988, the Hatch–Waxman legal framework was, for the most part, extended to the field of veterinary medicine through enactment of the Generic Animal Drug and Patent Term Restoration Act (GADPTR) (25).", "Like Hatch–Waxman on the human side, the GADPTR gave generic companies the benefit of earlier entry possibilities in exchange for pioneer companies being able to retrieve some of the lost years of valuable patent life that were unused due to the regulatory approval process.", "However, there are a few significant differences between the statutory provisions on the human side and the statutory provisions on the veterinary side (as discussed below):", "Statutory Differences Under the Generic Animal Drug and Patent Term Restoration Act", "The Option for a Patentee in the Animal Health Field to Take its Patent Term Extension for a Food-Producing Animal Indication Even if a Companion Animal Indication is Approved First", "The patent term restoration statute makes clear that a patent can only be extended once—and, generally, only for the first approved use (26).", "However, this would present a potential dilemma for an animal health company seeking regulatory approval in both companion animals and food–producing animals in cases where the company obtains its first approval for a companion animal indication while a much more lucrative indication for food-producing animals is still pending (e.g., a company’s new antibiotic is approved for dogs before it is approved for cows).", "To remove this potential dilemma, there is a unique provision in the patent term restoration statute that provides a patentee in the animal health area the important option of actually deferring its one-time opportunity for patent term extension until its approval for the food-producing animal indication comes through.", "This represents a very unusual statutory exception to the general rule that a patent can only be extended for the first approval.", "Genetically Engineered Animal Drugs are Expressly Excluded from Patent Term Restoration under GADPTR", "Unlike the relatively broader opportunities for patent term restoration in the case of human therapeutics, the law in the animal health area expressly excludes patentees from obtaining patent term restoration for genetically engineered animal drugs (i.e., drugs that were “primarily manufactured using recombinant DNA, recombinant RNA, hybridoma technology, or other processes involving site-specific genetic manipulation techniques”) (25).", "There is no such exclusion in the case of human therapeutics.", "Genetically Engineered Animal Drugs are Expressly Excluded from the “Safe Harbor” Provisions in 35 U.S.C. § 271(e)(1)", "The “safe harbor” exemptions from patent infringement provided in 35 U.S.C. § 271(e)(1) for “uses reasonably related to the development and submission of information under a Federal law which regulates...drugs or veterinary biological products” applies for both human and animal drugs.", "However, unlike human drugs, animal drugs or veterinary biologics are expressly excluded from the safe harbor if they were “primarily manufactured using recombinant DNA, recombinant RNA, hybridoma technology, or other processes involving site-specific genetic manipulation techniques”.", "Obtaining One Patent Extension for an Active Ingredient in a Human Indication and then Obtaining a Second Patent Extension for the Same Active Ingredient in an Animal Indication", "A question sometimes arises as to whether a “second patent term restoration” is possible for an animal health approval when the same active ingredient has already been extended for a human therapeutic product.", "In general, the patent term restoration statute contains strong prohibitions against obtaining a second patent term restoration for the same active ingredient (26).", "However, if one reads carefully through all the statutory prohibitions, the possibility for the following special scenario can be seen: Assume that a company has two patents: Patent A covering the use of Compound X in a human indication (as approved under Section 505 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (“FDCA”)) and Patent B covering use of the same Compound X in an animal indication (as approved under Section 512 of the FDCA).", "Then, in this particular situation (assuming all the other conditions are met), the company can obtain one extension—on Patent A—based on the human indication, plus an additional extension—on Patent B—based on the veterinary indication.", "Key to this scenario, of course, is the assumption that Patent A does not extend in scope to cover the veterinary use and Patent B does not extend in scope to cover the human use.", "Other Statutory Differences Between Laws Applying to Human Products and Laws Applying to Veterinary Products", "In the U.S., human drugs meeting certain specified requirements involving additional testing for pediatric use can qualify for an extra six months exclusivity (in addition to all other applicable exclusivity periods) (27), but there is no corresponding “pediatric exclusivity” for animal drugs.", "Orphan Drug Status for Human Drugs vs. “MUMS” Status for Animal Drugs", "In the U.S., human drugs meeting all the requisite conditions (e.g., rare diseases affecting fewer then 200,000 patients) can obtain a so-called “Orphan Drug” designation” under the Orphan Drug Act (28), whereby the holder is entitled to several specified benefits such as the possibility for tax credits and seven years of exclusivity with respect to the specified orphan indication.", "The Orphan Drug Act does not extend to animal drugs. However, animal drugs meeting certain criteria have the possibility to obtain a so-called Minor Use/Minor Species (MUMS) designation for qualified “minor species” (e.g., goats, sheep, fish, etc.) or for uncommon “minor uses” in the major animal groups (cattle, cats, dogs, swine, poultry, etc.).", "The MUMS designation also provides seven years of marketing exclusivity for that indication (29), but does not provide the basis for patent extensions or tax credits.", "Pharmaceutical Patent “Springboarding” in Australia", "Australian law provides a special “springboarding” safe harbor exemption from patent infringement whereby clinical testing of a human pharmaceutical product by an unlicensed party is permitted—during the term of the relevant patent—for the purpose of obtaining regulatory approval of a generic version of the patented product.", "However, unlike the provisions for clinical trials in the U.S. and Europe where most veterinary products enjoy safe harbors relatively similar to those enjoyed by human products, this particular “springboarding” safe harbor in Australia does not apply to pharmaceuticals in the veterinary field and thus represents a stark example of where the law for veterinary pharmaceuticals differs from the law for human pharmaceuticals.", "The author continues to search for examples where provisions in a nation’s patent laws might have unique application in the case of veterinary medicine and would welcome learning of further examples that readers may have encountered.", "Readers may also want to take a closer look at the areas of law where the human and veterinary fields diverge and consider whether the divergence is justified in each case.", "The views expressed herein are solely the views of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Schering-Plough Corporation.", "- 2.Guidelines for Examination of Applications for Compliance With the Utility Requirement, 66 Fed.

Our \"first generation\" of such matters involved agreements through which a", "brand-name drug manufacturer allegedly paid a generic drug manufacturer not to enter and", "compete. One aspect of a recent major settlement with Bristol-Myers Squibb (\"BMS\"),", "involved allegations of this type of conduct.(13) The FTC's complaint charged that BMS", "engaged in a series of anticompetitive acts over the past decade to obstruct entry of low-price generic competition for three of BMS's widely-used pharmaceutical products: two", "anti-cancer drugs, Taxol and Platinol, and the anti-anxiety agent BuSpar. The conduct", "included a $72.5 million payment to a would-be generic rival to abandon its legal challenge", "to the validity of a BMS patent and to stay out of the market until the patent expired.", "The Commission has settled three additional cases of this type, including an April 2002", "settlement resolving charges that American Home Products entered into an agreement with", "Schering-Plough Corporation to delay introduction of a generic potassium chloride", "supplement in exchange for millions of dollars.(14) An action against Schering-Plough and", "Upsher-Smith, which remains in administrative litigation, raises similar issues.", "the Hatch-Waxman Act, a branded drug manufacturer must list any patent claiming", "list of approved drugs and their related patents.

Our \"second generation\" of enforcement", "activities has involved allegations that individual brand-name manufacturers", "have delayed generic competition through the use of improper Orange Book listings", "FDA's automatic 30-month stay of approval of a generic drug.", "One facet of the FTC's BMS settlement involved allegedly", "improper Orange Book listings. The complaint stated that BMS misled the FDA", "enforceability of patents to secure listing in the FDA's \"Orange Book\"; breached", "its duty of good faith and candor with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office,", "patents claiming these drugs; and filed baseless patent infringement suits against", "drug firms that sought FDA approval to market lower-priced drugs.(15) Because of BMS's", "alleged pattern of anticompetitive conduct and the extensive resulting consumer harm, the", "Commission's proposed order necessarily contains strong - and in some respects", "Another recent FTC success in this area is an October 2002 settlement with Biovail", "Corporation, which resolved charges that Biovail illegally acquired a license to a patent and", "improperly listed the patent in the FDA's Orange Book as claiming Biovail's high blood", "(3) Agreements Between Generic Manufacturers. In a case against Biovail and Elan", "Corporation, plc (Elan), the Commission alleged that the companies entered into an", "agreement that provided substantial incentives for the two firms not to compete in the", "market for the 30 mg and 60 mg dosage strengths of generic Adalat CC, an anti-hypertension drug. The Commission approved a consent order in August 2002 requiring", "the firms to terminate their agreement and prohibiting them from entering similar agreements", "b.

In June 2002, the", "Commission authorized the staff to seek a preliminary injunction blocking Cytyc Corporation's", "proposed acquisition of Digene Corporation, involving the merger of two manufacturers of", "complementary cervical cancer screening tests.(19) The complaint alleged that the combined firm would", "have an incentive to use its market power in one product to stifle increased competition in the", "complementary product's market. Thus, if the merger had been consummated, rivals would have been", "substantially impeded from competing. Following the Commission's decision, the parties abandoned", "c. Law Enforcement Involving Health Care Providers. For decades, the FTC has", "worked to facilitate innovative and efficient arrangements for the delivery and financing of health care", "services by challenging artificial barriers to competition among health care providers. These efforts", "continue. In the past three months alone, the FTC has settled with seven groups of physicians for", "allegedly colluding to raise consumers' costs(20) and issued an administrative complaint against another.(21)", "Many of these cases involve significant numbers of doctors -- more than three-quarters of all doctors in", "the Carlsbad, New Mexico area in one matter, over 1,000 physicians in Dallas, Texas in another, and", "an organization consisting of more than 1,500 San Francisco physicians in the case in administrative", "litigation.

In January 2002, the FTC filed an amicus brief in pivotal", "private litigation involving allegations of improper Orange Book listing practices.(22) In re", "Buspirone involves allegations that BMS violated the antitrust laws by wrongfully listing a", "patent on its branded drug, BuSpar, in the FDA's Orange Book, thereby foreclosing", "generic competition. BMS argued that the conduct in question was covered by the Noerr-Pennington doctrine", "- a legal rule providing antitrust immunity for conduct that constitutes \"petitioning\" of", "a governmental authority. In its amicus brief opposing Noerr immunity,", "the Commission argued that submitting patent information for listing in the Orange", "constitute \"petitioning\" the FDA and that, even if it did, various exceptions", "immunity applied. The district court subsequently issued an order denying Noerr immunity", "and adopting much of the Commission's reasoning.(23) The Court's ruling does not mean", "that all improper Orange Book filings will give rise to antitrust liability. An antitrust plaintiff", "still must prove an underlying antitrust claim. The Buspirone decision merely establishes", "that Orange Book filings are not automatically immune from antitrust scrutiny.", "the FTC issued a report entitled \"Generic Drug Entry", "Prior to Patent Expiration: An FTC Study,\" which evaluated whether Hatch-Waxman", "is susceptible to strategies to delay or deter consumer access to generic alternatives", "to brand-name drug products.(24) The report recommended changes in the law to ensure that generic", "entry is not delayed unreasonably, including through anticompetitive activity. In October", "2002, President Bush directed the FDA to implement one of the key findings identified in", "the FTC study.(25) Last month, the FDA approved a new rule to curb one of the abuses", "uncovered by the FTC study - pharmaceutical firms' alleged misuse of the Hatch-Waxman", "patent listing provisions - to speed consumer access to lower-cost generic drugs.(26) In", "addition, both the Senate and House of Representatives recently passed bills that", "incorporate the FTC study's two major legislative recommendations.(27)", "- Hearings on Health Care and Competition Law and Policy.", "To explore developments in the dynamic health care market, the FTC, working", "commenced a series of hearings on \"Health Care and Competition Law and Policy\" on", "February 26, 2003.(28) Over a seven-month period, the FTC and DOJ are spending almost", "30 days of hearings in a comprehensive examination of a wide range of health care issues,", "involving hospitals, physicians, insurers, pharmaceuticals, long-term care, Medicare, and", "consumer information, among others. To date, the hearings have focused on the specific", "challenges and complications involved in applying competition law and policy to health care;", "issues involved in hospital merger cases and other joint arrangements, including geographic", "and product market definition; horizontal hospital networks and vertical arrangements with", "other health care providers; the competitive effects of mergers of health insurance", "providers; and consumer information and quality of care issues.(29) A public report that", "incorporates the results of the hearings will be prepared after the hearings.", "- Hospital Merger Retrospectives. In addition, the Bureaus of Economics and", "Competition are evaluating the effects of consummated hospital mergers in several cities.", "The agency will announce the results of these retrospective studies whether the mergers in", "question may have been beneficial or harmful to consumers. If the analysis reveals that one", "or more of the mergers considered were anticompetitive, then the Commission will carefully", "consider whether an administrative enforcement action would be warranted. The", "availability of an appropriate remedy will obviously influence the FTC's decision(s). In any", "event, the agency will obtain useful real-world information about the consequences of", "particular transactions and the nature of competitive forces in health care, which will be", "enormously helpful in analyzing and possibly challenging future hospital mergers.", "Energy is vital to the entire economy and represents a significant portion of total U.S. economic", "output. The FTC has focused considerable resources on energy issues, including conducting in-depth", "studies of evolving energy markets and investigating numerous oil company mergers.", "As a complement to the analysis based on OPIS data, the FTC staff also regularly reviews", "reports from the Department of Energy's Consumer Gasoline Price Hotline, searching for", "prices significantly above the levels indicated by the FTC's econometric model or other", "indications of potential problems. Throughout most of the past two years, gasoline prices in", "U.S. markets have been within their predicted normal bounds. Of course, the major factor", "affecting U.S. gasoline prices is the substantial fluctuation in crude oil prices. Prices outside", "the normal bounds trigger further staff inquiry to determine what factors might be causing", "price anomalies in a given area. These factors could include supply disruptions such as", "refinery or pipeline outages, changes in taxes or fuel specifications, unusual changes in", "demand due to weather conditions and the like, and possible anticompetitive activity.", "To enhance the Gasoline Price Monitoring Project, the FTC has recently asked each state", "Attorney General to forward to the FTC's attention consumer complaints they receive", "about gasoline prices. The staff will incorporate these complaints into its ongoing analysis of", "gasoline prices around the country, using the complaints to help locate price anomalies", "outside of the 360 cities for which the staff already receives daily pricing data.", "The goal of the Monitoring Project is to alert the FTC to unusual changes in gasoline prices", "so that further inquiry can be undertaken expeditiously. When price increases do not", "appear to have market-driven causes, the FTC staff will consult with the Energy", "Information Agency of the Department of Energy. The FTC staff also will contact the", "offices of the appropriate state Attorneys General to discuss the anomaly and the", "appropriate course for any further inquiry, including the possible opening of a law", "The continuing development of \"high-tech\" industries", "and the significance of intellectual property rights influence our antitrust", "agenda. The U.S. economy is more knowledge-based than ever. While", "the fundamental principles of antitrust do not differ when applied to high-tech", "industries, or other industries in which patents or other intellectual property", "complex, take more time to resolve, and require different kinds of expertise.", "To address these needs, we now have patent lawyers on staff, and we sometimes", "As technology advances, there will be increased efforts to establish industry standards for the", "development and manufacture of new products. While the adoption of standards is often", "procompetitive, the standards setting process, which involves competitors' meeting to set product", "specifications, can be an area for antitrust concern. In a complaint issued in June 2002, the", "Commission has charged that Rambus, Inc., a participant in an electronics industry standards-setting", "organization, failed to disclose - in violation of the organization's rules - that it had a patent and several", "pending patent applications on technologies that eventually were adopted as part of the industry", "standard.(35) The standard at issue involved a common form of computer memory used in a wide variety", "of popular consumer electronic products, such as personal computers, fax machines, video games, and", "personal digital assistants. The Commission's complaint, which is currently being litigated before an", "Administrative Law Judge, alleges that once the standard was adopted, Rambus was in a position to", "reap millions in royalty fees each year, and potentially more than a billion dollars over the life of the", "patents.(36) Because standard-setting abuses can harm robust and efficiency-enhancing competition in", "high tech products and innovation, the Commission will continue to pursue investigations in this", "ground-breaking hearings on \"Competition and Intellectual Property Law and Policy", "Knowledge-Based Economy.\"(38) These hearings, which took place throughout 2002 and", "were held in Washington and Northern California, involved testimony from academics,", "industry leaders, technologists and others about the increasing need to manage the issues at", "the intersection of competition and intellectual property law and policy. The FTC", "anticipates releasing a report on its findings later this year.", "heralded by many as the next industrial revolution, has immense potential", "enormous freedom. Contrary to the perception of the Internet as a virtually", "unfettered free market, however, extension of pre-existing state regulations", "anticompetitive business practices may be limiting the cost savings or convenience", "that the Internet affords, without offsetting benefits. The FTC's Internet", "analyzing state regulations that may have pro-consumer or pro-competition rationales,", "but that nevertheless may restrict the entry of new Internet competitors.", "It also is examining barriers that arise when private parties employ potentially", "as when suppliers or dealers apply collective pressure to limit online sales.", "- Internet Competition Workshop. In October 2002, the Commission hosted a three-day", "public workshop examining potential barriers to e-commerce in ten different industries.(39)", "The purpose of the workshop was to (1) enhance the Commission's understanding of the", "nature of competition in e-commerce; (2) help educate policymakers about the effects of", "overly restrictive state regulations; and (3) help educate private entities about the types of", "business practices that may or may not be viewed as problematic. The workshop included", "panel discussions addressing specific industries that have grown via the Internet, but where", "competition may be constrained by state regulations or business practices.", "- E-commerce Advocacy. The Internet Task Force has taken the lead in drafting a number", "of competition advocacy pieces. Two have had a clear impact in helping decision-makers", "take consumers' interests into account: (1) the Connecticut Board of Examiners for", "Opticians decided in June 2003, in accordance with our advice, that out-of-state sellers", "who ship contact lenses to Connecticut residents need not have a Connecticut optician's", "license, provided that the lenses are sold pursuant to a lawful prescription;(40) and (2) on", "January 24, 2003, the North Carolina State Bar released two opinions eliminating the", "requirement that an attorney be physically present at real estate closings, and allowing non-attorneys to obtain signatures and receive and disburse funds, as we had recommended in", "- Report on Internet Wine Sales. Earlier this month, the Commission released a staff", "report concluding that e-commerce offers consumers lower prices and more choices in the", "wine market, and that states could expand e-commerce by permitting direct shipping of", "wine to consumers.(42) The empirical study found that state bans on direct shipping prevent", "consumers from saving as much as 21 percent on some wines and from conveniently", "purchasing many popular wines from suppliers around the country. The report also", "concluded that states may be able to limit sales to minors through less restrictive means than", "an outright ban on direct shipping, such as by requiring that a supplier verify the recipient's", "age and obtain an adult's signature before delivering the wine.", "As a general matter, immunity from the antitrust laws is exceptional and disfavored.(43) The", "antitrust laws, \"a comprehensive charter of economic liberty aimed at preserving free and unfettered", "competition,\" rest on the premise that \"the unrestrained interaction of competitive", "forces will yield the best allocation of our economic resources, the lowest prices,", "material progress, while at the same time providing an environment conducive", "democratic political and social institutions.\"(44) Accordingly, few industries or competitive situations are", "not subject to the antitrust laws. In fact, there has been a trend to deregulate industries and remove", "antitrust immunities rather than to create more of them.(45)", "Proponents of antitrust immunity frequently claim a need for special treatment because firms", "engaged in a particular industry or activity need to collaborate on matters that have special value or", "importance to our economy, national security, or other societal interests. They assert that the antitrust", "laws will impose burdensome compliance obligations or chill beneficial activity. They also frequently", "claim that an exemption would only clarify that the conduct, which is already permissible, does not", "violate the antitrust laws. They therefore assert that the situation warrants special treatment.", "We do not believe these reasons provide a sound basis for an antitrust exemption. Antitrust", "analysis today is highly capable of distinguishing harmful and unreasonable conduct from conduct that", "has a legitimate justification, and can therefore accommodate any legitimate needs for competitor", "collaboration. Further, case precedents, interpretive Guidelines, and advisory opinions from the FTC", "and the DOJ, along with advice from antitrust counsel, can enable firms to make well-informed", "judgments about whether a proposed activity will present antitrust risks. Therefore, antitrust", "Moreover, unnecessary antitrust exemptions have significant potential to be harmful. First, an", "exemption for conduct that does not violate the antitrust laws inevitably will encourage more demands", "for similar treatment, gradually eroding the fundamental principle that antitrust constitutes the", "cornerstone of a competitive market economy. Second, an unnecessary exemption can create", "confusion or uncertainty whether the relevant conduct would otherwise violate the antitrust laws. Third,", "unnecessary, imprecise, or excessively broad antitrust immunities may harm consumers by providing a", "pretextual reason for parties inappropriately to discuss and collaborate on matters that are not, or", "should not be, exempt.(46) Such conduct is difficult to detect and prosecute and can hinder, rather than", "facilitate, the important economic and security contributions that it was hoped the particular industry", "would make. Therefore, we believe that selective antitrust exemptions generally are unwise as well as", "B. The State Action and Noerr-Pennington Doctrines", "The state action doctrine - first articulated in Parker v. Brown(48) - provides a defense to", "certain antitrust claims involving the regulatory conduct of state governments. Similarly, the Noerr-Pennington doctrine - first articulated in Eastern R.R. Presidents Conf. v. Noerr Motor Freight(49)", "and United Mine Workers of America v. Pennington(50) -", "efforts to \"petition\" the government. When properly applied, both doctrines", "serve important Constitutional interests. The state action defense is grounded", "to prevent antitrust enforcement from interfering with legitimate state regulatory", "immunity, on the other hand, is grounded in First Amendment principles and is intended to protect a", "citizen's right to petition the government for the redress of grievances.", "While the core principles underlying these doctrines have validity, some lower court decisions", "have expanded the reach of both doctrines beyond the precepts originally articulated by the Supreme", "Court. Moreover, when the governing standard is unclear, enforcement (and deterrence) can be", "problematic. Thus, for example, the American Bar Association Antitrust Section's 2001 report on", "antitrust policy recommended a reexamination of the scope of the state action doctrine.(51)", "The scope of these doctrines has important consequences for consumers. Through study and", "analysis, and by bringing carefully-selected enforcement actions, the FTC can help to clarify the limits of", "the state action and Noerr-Pennington doctrines. To that end, we established FTC Task Forces to", "examine state action and Noerr issues. The work of both Task Forces has resulted in a variety of", "actions, including antitrust enforcement, amicus briefs, and competition advocacy.", "careful analysis of existing case law on the scope of the state action defense.", "The Task Force has observed that some courts have applied the", "doctrine too broadly, thereby protecting anticompetitive conduct of parties acting", "rather than the interest of \"the state itself.\" An overbroad application can be especially problematic", "when the party purportedly acting pursuant to a delegation of state authority is a private market", "participant with strong incentives to restrain trade. The Task Force's work has resulted in investigations", "that we hope will clarify the two key elements of the state action defense - \"clear articulation\" of the", "state's intent to displace competition, and \"active supervision\" of any anticompetitive", "private agreements. In the Analysis to Aid Public Comment in the Commission's", "recent Indiana Movers consent order, for example, we described three", "factors relevant to showing that the state has \"actively", "supervised\" the conduct for which the state action defense is asserted: (1)", "the development of an adequate factual record, including notice and opportunity", "merits that would provide analysis and reasoning, and supporting evidence, that", "the private conduct furthers the legislature's objectives; and (3) a specific", "of how the private action comports with the substantive standards established", "by the state legislature, particularly when the standards include competition", "Commission issued administrative complaints in three similar cases involving associations of household", "goods movers in three states.(53) The complaints allege that the associations have violated the FTC Act", "by engaging in collective action in the form of filing tariffs containing collective rates on behalf of their", "members. One or more of these cases may eventually present an opportunity for further clarification of", "The Noerr-Pennington Task Force is conducting a similar analysis of existing case law", "regarding Noerr-Pennington immunity. As in the state action context,", "the Task Force has observed that some courts have applied the doctrine too broadly.", "immunity in spite of the fact that the anticompetitive conduct at issue had no \"petitioning\" component", "whatsoever. In other instances courts have immunized abusive tactics, such as", "repetitive lawsuits and misrepresentations, that clearly were intended to delay", "than legitimately to petition the government. The Task Force has worked to identify", "be inconsistent with the underlying rationale for Noerr immunity even when petitioning of the", "government may be involved. For example, members of the Task Force played a key role in", "preparation of the Commission's amicus brief in In re Buspirone, discussed above.", "Several recent FTC enforcement actions also involve Noerr issues. For example, in the", "Commission's BMS settlement, discussed above, most of the acts challenged involved use of", "governmental processes.(54) Thus, the complaint affirmatively pled that Noerr did not immunize BMS's", "actions. Among other reasons cited, the complaint indicated that BMS's alleged knowing and material", "misrepresentations to the FDA fell outside of Noerr protection. The Commission's Unocal case, also", "discussed above, raises a similar issue.(55) If proven, the allegation that Unocal urged the California", "air-quality board to adopt a standard for clean-burning gasoline, while misrepresenting its intentions", "regarding any intellectual property rights in the standard may present the Commission with an", "opportunity to evaluate more fully the significance of misrepresentations to a government entity for a", "BMS also raised the question whether Noerr protects conduct that merely triggers ministerial", "government action rather than seeking a discretionary decision.(56) Noting the court's observation in In", "re Buspirone Antitrust Litigation,(57) the Commission stated that Orange Book filings are not entitled to", "Noerr protection because they involve no petitioning; the FDA merely accepts the NDA holder's", "representations and exercises no intervening judgment.(58)", "In addition, the Commission noted in BMS that a clear and systematic pattern of anticompetitive", "misuse of governmental processes - such as BMS's alleged inequitable conduct at the PTO, wrongful", "Orange Book listings, sham litigation, and payments for generics not to enter is inconsistent with Noerr", "protection - caused the challenged conduct to fall outside the scope of Noerr protection. In the", "Commission's view, the logic and policy underlying the Supreme Court's California Motor", "Transport(59) decision, which held a pattern of filings undertaken without regard to their merits to be", "outside the protections of Noerr, supported the application of a pattern exception for BMS's alleged", "As part of an overall movement to make government more accessible electronically, the FTC,", "working with the DOJ, is conducting final refinement and testing of an electronic system for filing HSR", "premerger notifications. The system, along with rules changes necessary to allow filing electronically,", "should be complete and ready for use this fall.

The Federal Circuit also found that substantial evidence supported the jury’s conclusion that the fourteen batches at issue were not manufactured “solely for uses reasonably related to the development and submission of information” to the FDA.", "The jury had limited the protected batches to two that were used for qualifying Hospira’s manufacturing process and equipment, and five that were used for a mandatory pre-approval inspection by the FDA.", "Both documentary evidence and expert testimony demonstrated that the manufacturing of the remaining batches was not required for FDA pre-approval, and was instead intended to serve as the commercial inventory of a future launch.", "The court focused on the differences between manufacturing required by the FDA for an approval, and drug batches made for commercial use (e.g., continued process verification) or post-approval commitments (e.g., stability testing), where only the former are protected by the Safe Harbor provision.", "The court further rejected Hospira’s argument that simply submitting information about a drug substance lot to the FDA brings the manufacture of that lot within the protections of the Safe Harbor, noting that “routine record retention requirements associated with testing and other aspects of the commercial production process” are not protected by the Safe Harbor.", "Momenta Pharms., Inc. v.

Several PTMs, such as glycosylation, can have a direct impact on the clinical properties of therapeutic proteins, potentially influencing their biologic activity (potency), pharmacokinetics (PK), pharmacodynamics (PD) or immunogenicity [38].", "Glycosylation can be considered the most complex PTM, and its potential for clinically relevant impact and its susceptibility to change based on process conditions make it extremely challenging to control [39].", "For example, the degree of fucosylation and mannosylation can have a significant impact on the effector function of a mAb [namely FcRIIIa receptor binding and antibody-dependent cell cytotoxicity (ADCC)], which plays a key role in triggering the killing of disease cells bound by the therapeutic antibody by natural killer cells [38, 40].", "Likewise, the extent of terminal mannose or sialic acids can significantly alter the circulating PK half-life of an antibody or a fusion protein, and the presence of an α-Galactose epitope or N-glycolylneuraminic sialic acid can elicit an immunogenic response [38, 41].", "Importantly, PTMs can result from naturally occurring processes or can be introduced by the manufacturing process used to produce biologic drugs [38].", "For example, the temperature in the bioreactor or the pH of the final formulation can induce protein aggregation if not properly controlled [35], which can be associated with the immunogenicity of a biologic therapy", "[42, 43]. This potential for process variations to influence the immunogenicity of a compound poses some relevant clinical concerns because there are no uniform standards for the type, quantity and quality of evidence, and for guidance on experimental design for immunogenicity assays or criteria to compare the immunogenicity of biologic drugs [44].", "Furthermore, the sensitivity and specificity of assays for testing immunogenic responses may still be insufficient to predict rare cases of immunogenicity [43].", "Other than glycosylation and aggregation, advanced biologics can have dozens of additional CQAs, which are defined as physical, chemical or biological properties that should be within an appropriate limit, range or distribution to ensure the desired product quality (i.e. CQA ranges that ensure adequate efficacy and safety)", "[6, 45–47]. As these attributes are influenced not only by the cell-mediated PTMs, but also by the manufacturing process [48, 49], it is important to understand how the cell culture, purification, storage and other phases of the manufacturing process can lead to further modifications and can alter the distribution of product-related species in the final product [42].", "During the cell culture phase, individual parameters, such as the temperature, pH and glucose concentration of the cell culture medium, the cell culture duration and even the type of reactor used, have the potential to alter the CQAs of the protein [37, 50].", "Different steps of the purification phases can also alter the oxidation, deamidation, fragmentation and aggregation of the biological molecules [50].", "As each step of the manufacturing process has multiple process parameters that can alter the quality of the product, the manufacturing process for biologics is highly challenging, with batch-to-batch variability being the norm.", "For example, a recent study found significant variation in the level of glycosylation in several batches of common originator biologic therapies, such as infliximab, trastuzumab and bevacizumab; a phenomenon that can also be expected in biosimilars [39].", "As such, when developing a biosimilar, the variability associated with the reference product must be well understood, and the manufacturing process for the biosimilar must be carefully controlled, as even minor process alterations may have a potential irreparable impact on the qualities of the biosimilar and its comparability with the reference product", "Biologic product quality changes resulting from process variation may be unintended or intended. Unintended process variation may occur owing to the impact of uncontrolled variables and can result in gradual changes over time or in a sudden shift in a quality attribute, a process called manufacturing drift [51–53].", "The source of the change may not be well understood and may be an unintended result of changes outside of the manufacturer’s control, such as variability in raw material.", "Lack of control or understanding of the process may result in an unusable product. If the biosimilar does not meet the release or similarity criteria, it creates the potential for a supply disruption or drug recall; if several batches are affected, the potential for a drug shortage increases [54].", "In addition to normal batch-to-batch variability and drift, additional changes in product quality may be the result of intentional changes made by the manufacturers of biological medicines to the manufacturing process and can range from changes in manufacturing sites to changes in suppliers or cell culture media.", "In addition, changes to a manufacturing process are sometimes made to introduce new technologies that can improve productivity.", "This type of manufacturing evolution has been observed in most, if not all, approved anti-rheumatic biologics on the market in the European Union (EU) today since their initial approval, with some having had more than 50 approved changes [35, 51, 53, 55–57].", "In some cases, these changes have modified the quality of the molecule, but the majority of post-approval manufacturing changes have been considered to be non-critical because they are unlikely to have impacted the CQAs of the product", "Preclinical analytical comparability as the foundation", "The development of new biologics emphasizes the role of clinical trials because the goal of the development process is to demonstrate de novo the risk–benefit profile of the drug candidate.", "However, in biosimilar development the reverse is true, because the aim of the manufacturer is to demonstrate that the biosimilar is highly similar to the reference product by demonstrating that physicochemical and biological CQAs of the biosmiliar closely match those of the originator, to be able to leverage the risk–benefit profile that has previously been established by the manufacturer of the originator product", "[6, 45, 46].

Physicochemical and biological analytical tools required for accurately mapping CQAs and demonstrating comparability of the biosimilar with the reference biologic (Fig. 3) have vastly improved over the past few years [45, 59].", "These tools have much greater sensitivity, resolution and throughput compared with those accessible to the developers of the first generation of biologicals [42, 45, 59].", "For example, the resolution potential of mass spectrometry has improved by a factor of more than 1 million in the past three decades, implying that we are now able to quantify differences in molecules at the parts-per-trillion level [60].", "As a consequence, the preclinical phase, including the analytical comparability exercise, is where the most effort is concentrated because this is where most of the uncertainty regarding the similarity of two molecules is addressed and reduced (Fig.", "The originator fingerprint: a framework for biosimilar development", "Demonstrating similarity first begins at the level of the building block, or molecular attribute. Given that advanced biologics can have many CQAs and that originator biologics have a high degree of inherent variability attributable to PTMs or to the manufacturing process, the development of a biosimilar must begin by thoroughly characterizing as many of the quality attributes of the originator as possible and establishing the range of variation for each attribute that is deemed to be critical (i.e. CQAs)", "[61]. The analytical characterization typically includes the assessment of physicochemical attributes (which can include primary and higher-order structure, purity and glycosylation) and functional attributes [which shed light on the molecule’s mechanism of action (MOA) and intended biological activity]", "[6].

Amgen, Inc., 582 U.S. __, Nos. 15-1039, 15-1195, Slip. Op. (June 12, 2017).", "On June 12, 2017, the Supreme Court decided the highly anticipated first case involving the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act (BPCIA).1 The Supreme Court addressed two related questions: (1) whether the statutory language instructing a biosimilar applicant to provide its application and manufacturing information to the reference biologic sponsor after FDA acceptance of the application is enforceable by injunction; and (2) whether the biosimilar applicant must give notice of intended commercial marketing to the reference biologic sponsor only after obtaining an approved license from FDA.2 Upholding the decision of the Federal Circuit on the first question (albeit using different reasoning) and reversing the Federal Circuit on the second question, the Court also introduced some uncertainty for the future.", "As background, the BPCIA introduced an abbreviated route to market for biosimilar and interchangeable biologic products.", "Congress sought to create a streamlined approval process for biologics modeled in part on the Hatch-Waxman Act of 1984 that established the abbreviated new drug application.3 That legislation resulted in significant cost savings by incentivizing generic drug development based on bioequivalence to an FDA approved drug.", "Public patent disclosure4 and patent certification procedures5 built into the Hatch-Waxman Act were crafted as litigation-forcing mechanisms to challenge weak or invalid patents.", "In addition to the provisions regarding clinical development and regulatory review, the BPCIA likewise addresses disclosure and patent issues.", "However, the BPCIA differs sharply from the generic drug provisions on these aspects. Specifically, the amended Public Health Service Act §351, or 42 U.S.C. §262, states:", "Not later than 20 days after the Secretary notifies the…applicant that the application has been accepted for review, the…applicant— (A) shall provide to the reference product sponsor a copy of the application submitted to the Secretary…, and such other information that describes the process or processes used to manufacture the biological product that is the subject of such application.6", "The statute subsequently provides for a private, informational back-and-forth between the biosimilar applicant and the reference biologic sponsor following such disclosure.7", "The statute contemplates good faith negotiations between the two parties and, if the parties cannot come to agreement, the filing of a patent infringement action against the biosimilar applicant.8 These provisions have come to be known as the “patent dance.”", "Additionally, the statute requires that the biosimilar applicant “shall provide notice to the reference product sponsor not later than 180 days before the date of the first commercial marketing of the biological product licensed under subsection (k).”9 Once notice is received, the reference biologic sponsor may seek a preliminary injunction preventing the biosimilar applicant from manufacturing or selling the biosimilar product until specific patent disputes are resolved.10", "The provisions were swiftly criticized by industry and practitioners as unclear. Relevant to the Supreme Court’s recent decision, Amgen and Sandoz disputed various portions of the statute as they related to the development of Sandoz’s product Zarxio, the biosimilar version of Amgen’s Neupogen (filgrastim).11 FDA had accepted Sandoz’s biosimilar application July 7, 2014; the following day Sandoz notified Amgen that it had submitted the application and that it intended to commercially market the product immediately upon FDA approval.12 Sandoz subsequently informed Amgen that it would not disclose the application or manufacturing information and advised Amgen of the statutory option to sue for patent infringement.13", "On October 24, 2014, Amgen filed suit against Sandoz in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California, alleging both unfair competition under California law and patent infringement.14 Amgen’s complaint requested injunctive relief to prevent Sandoz from profiting from its deliberate non-compliance with the BPCIA, citing the refusal to provide the application and manufacturing information within 20 days following FDA’s acceptance of the application.", "Sandoz argued that the patent was invalid and thus not infringed, and that they did not violate the BPCIA.", "A November 2013 decision involving the two parties from the same court was on appeal to the Federal Circuit on the technical question of when the 180-day notice of commercial marketing requirement is triggered.15 The two issues were ultimately addressed together by the Federal Circuit, which affirmed the dismissal of the state law claims and held that declaratory judgment remedies (rather than injunction) were the only available remedies for a failure to provide the application and manufacturing information.16 The Federal Circuit also held that the applicant’s biosimilar must be licensed at the time the applicant gives the reference sponsor 180-day notice.17", "Petitions for certiorari were granted and consolidated by the Supreme Court in January 201718 and oral arguments were held April 26, 2017.", "As a recap, two questions faced the Court: (1) whether the statutory language instructing a biosimilar applicant to provide its application and manufacturing information to the reference biologic sponsor after FDA acceptance of the application is enforceable by injunction; and (2) whether the biosimilar applicant must give notice of intended commercial marketing to the reference biologic sponsor only after obtaining an approved license from FDA.19", "On the first question, the Supreme Court affirmed the Federal Circuit, though clarified the basis for that outcome.", "The Court held that 42 U.S.C. §262(l)(2)(A) was not enforceable by injunction under federal law because the exclusive remedy provided in the statute was an action for declaratory judgment brought by the reference biologic sponsor under 42 U.S.C. §262(l)(9)(C).20 Disagreeing with the Federal Circuit’s reasoning, the Court specifically noted that because there had been no application and manufacturing information disclosed to Amgen, there was no “artificial infringement” triggering 35 U.S.C. §271(e)(4) remedies.21 Signaling fodder for future litigation, the Court remanded to the Federal Circuit the issue of whether California unfair competition law provides a separate remedy.22 The Court also instructed the Federal Circuit to consider whether the BCPIA preempts state law remedies and whether Sandoz forfeited a preemption defense.23 As to the remand on the California state law question, subsequent analysis of the breadth of state unfair competition law will pose challenges for the lower courts as there are significant differences from state to state on available remedies.", "Uncertainty may stir an increase in state law claims in cases involving the BPCIA where allegations of noncompliance with the federal statute are asserted.", "This issue also implicates a recent Supreme Court decision regarding personal jurisdiction in California litigation.24", "On the second question, the Court reversed the Federal Circuit. The Court held that 42 U.S.C. §262(l)(8)(A) allows a biosimilar applicant to provide notice of commercial marketing to the reference biologic sponsor prior to obtaining a license from FDA.25", "In other words, the 180-day notice may be provided either before or after receiving FDA approval. The Court arrived at this conclusion relying both on a plain language statutory interpretation and on a structural analysis of other timing provisions in the statute.26 This holding provides a significant advantage to biosimilar applicants.", "Requiring notice at any point 180 days before approval (after submission of the application) ultimately gives the reference sponsor less time as the only product on the market, while requiring 180-day notification only after FDA approval would benefit the reference sponsor.", "The decision leaves biosimilar applicants with a few choices and some uncertainty. If an applicant declines to provide the application and manufacturing information to the reference product sponsor, it faces a potentially wide-ranging patent infringement challenge controlled by the sponsor.", "Conforming to the BPCIA “patent dance” procedures provides more predictability over the scope of patent litigation, yet forces disclosure of confidential product information.", "The Federal Circuit will also be revisiting the state law question, meaning that there may be possible injunctive or other relief available at the state level.", "Intertwined with this issue is whether the BPCIA preempts state law in this area. Lastly, FDA may step in and engage in rulemaking to interpret the timing of notice as it relates to the license given the agency’s broad rulemaking powers.", "Justice Breyer penned a short, yet intriguing, concurrence channeling Brand X,27 emphasizing that the Court’s interpretation of the statute was “reasonable” and that FDA had the authority to “depart from, or modify” that interpretation in the future.28 Stay tuned.", "- Pub.

TREATMENT OF NEW MATTERIf new subject matter is added to the disclosure, whether it be in the abstract, the specification, or the drawings, the examiner should object to the introduction of new matter under 35 U.S.C. 132 or 251 as appropriate, and require applicant to cancel the new matter.", "If new matter is added to the claims, the examiner should reject the claims under 35 U.S.C. 112(a) or pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 112, first paragraph - written description requirement.", "In re Rasmussen, 650 F.2d 1212, 211 USPQ 323 (CCPA 1981). The examiner should still consider the subject matter added to the claim in making rejections based on prior art since the new matter rejection may be overcome by applicant.", "When the claims have not been amended, per se, but the specification has been amended to add new matter, a rejection of the claims under 35 U.S.C. 112(a) or pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 112, first paragraph, should be made whenever any of the claim limitations are affected by the added material.", "When an amendment is filed in reply to an objection or rejection based on 35 U.S.C. 112(a) or pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 112, first paragraph, a study of the entire application is often necessary to determine whether or not “new matter” is involved.", "Applicant should therefore specifically point out the support for any amendments made to the disclosure.", "II. REVIEW OF NEW MATTER OBJECTIONS AND/OR REJECTIONSWhile ordinarily an objection is petitionable, and a rejection is appealable, when the objection is \"determinative of the rejection\", such as the case where the examiner has indicated that the disclosure contains new matter, the matter may be addressed by the Patent Trial and Appeal Board.", "See MPEP § 1201. For instance, if the claims and specification or drawings contain new matter either directly or indirectly, and there has been both a rejection and objection by the examiner, the issue becomes appealable and should not be decided by petition.", "III. CLAIMED SUBJECT MATTER NOT DISCLOSED IN REMAINDER OF SPECIFICATIONThe claims as filed in the original specification are part of the disclosure and therefore, if an application as originally filed contains a claim disclosing material not disclosed in the remainder of the specification, the applicant may amend the specification to include the claimed subject matter.", "In reBenno, 768 F.2d 1340, 226 USPQ 683 (Fed. Cir. 1985).

OBVIOUS ERRORSAn amendment to correct an obvious error does not constitute new matter where one skilled in the art would not only recognize the existence of error in the specification, but also the appropriate correction.", "Where a foreign priority document under 35 U.S.C. 119 is of record in the U.S. application file, applicant may not rely on the disclosure of that document to support correction of an error in the pending U.S. application.", "Ex parteBondiou, 132 USPQ 356 (Bd. Pat. App. & Int. 1961). This prohibition applies regardless of the language of the foreign priority documents because a claim for priority is simply a claim for the benefit of an earlier filing date for subject matter that is common to two or more applications, and does not serve to incorporate the content of the priority document in the application in which the claim for priority is made.", "This prohibition does not apply where the U.S. application explicitly incorporates the foreign priority document by reference.", "For applications filed on or after September 21, 2004, where all or a portion of the specification or drawing(s) is inadvertently omitted from the U.S. application, a claim under 37 CFR 1.55 for priority of a prior-filed foreign application that is present on the filing date of the application is considered an incorporation by reference of the prior-filed foreign application as to the inadvertently omitted portion of the specification or drawing(s), subject to the conditions and requirements of 37 CFR 1.57(a).", "Where a U.S. application as originally filed was in a non-English language and an English translation thereof was subsequently submitted pursuant to 37 CFR 1.52(d), if there is an error in the English translation, applicant may rely on the disclosure of the originally filed non-English language U.S. application to support correction of an error in the English translation document.", "2163.07(a) Inherent Function, Theory, or Advantage [R-07.2022]", "By disclosing in a patent application a device that inherently performs a function or has a property, operates according to a theory or has an advantage, a patent application necessarily discloses that function, theory or advantage, even though it says nothing explicit concerning it.", "The application may later be amended to recite the function, theory or advantage without introducing prohibited new matter.", "In reReynolds, 443 F.2d 384, 170 USPQ 94 (CCPA 1971); In reSmythe, 480 F. 2d 1376, 178 USPQ 279 (CCPA 1973); Yeda Research and Dev.

First, he helped build Morgan Stanley’s European healthcare group, then did the same at Moelis & Co and now he heads Novo Holdings, the majority shareholder of Danish household biotech names NovoZymes and Novo Nordisk.", "I asked him about the company’s healthcare investment strategy and his CEO experience.", "Kasim Kutay started life as an investment banker at Morgan Stanley in 1989. Five years later, he joined its healthcare group, when it was just two people — him and Robert Bradway, who is now the CEO of Amgen.", "But unlike Bradway, Kutay is not a scientist by education. “I wish I was,” he told me over the phone.", "“You’ll never be as good as the scientists in certain areas, but you’ll certainly develop a reasonable amount of expertise when you work with healthcare companies for 25 years-plus.”", "Though biotech CEOs increasingly seem to have PhDs in their field, Kutay has significant business experience.", "After graduating from LSE with an MSc in 1987, he spent 18 years at Morgan Stanley, eventually rising to become Managing Director and Chairman of the European Healthcare Group.", "Prior to joining Novo Holdings, Kutay was a Partner and member of the Management Committee of Moelis & Co.", "Kutay became CEO of Novo Holdings in 2016: he now manages its assets worth over €50B and sits on the boards of NovoZymes and Novo Nordisk.", "I caught up with him to see what pearls of wisdom he had for other CEOs and what the investment strategy is for one of Europe’s healthcare giants.", "So in biotech, we’ve all heard of Novo Nordisk and NovoZymes, but what is Novo Holdings exactly?", "Novo Holdings is more than just biotech and venture investments since it is the controlling shareholder in Novo Nordisk and in NovoZymes; we refer to that as the Holdings side of the business.", "And then we have the investment side of the business, which is life sciences-focused with three distinct teams including Novo Seeds, Novo Ventures and Principal Investments.", "The latter is focused on larger revenue-generating or well-established companies like ConvaTec Plc, a UK-listed medical device company of where we acquired 19% earlier this year for $1.5B. Our investment strategy has generated good returns for our shareholder, the Novo Nordisk Foundation — our 5-year IRR for Life Science Investments stands at 21%.", "Another investment we made this year in Principal Investments is the 10% we acquired in Germany-based Evotec, which, fortunately for us, has risen threefold since our investment.", "As far as skillsets go, absolutely, understanding the basics of science and the healthcare lexicon is critical; but what is also critical is a business skill set that allows you to manage, on a day-to-day basis, large holding and investment companies and meaningfully contribute to the boards of very sizable enterprises.", "It’s that skillset, frankly, which certainly in the position of CEO, I would regard as important as life science knowledge.", "Could you be more specific about which business skills are important?", "I could go on and on, but in sum, there are leadership, operational, managerial and strategic elements — it’s really a multi-faceted skill set.", "What is also important is adaptability or an international mindset, that allows you to work outside of an Anglo-Saxon framework and environment.", "Each market has its own very specific approach, and here in Denmark, there’s a particular ethos, a particular style, and a particular thinking behind business.", "It helps significantly if one has had the opportunity to have been exposed to a particular country’s business ethos.", "In my case, I have been fortunate to have worked with many Danish companies including Novo Holdings.", "Another important skill set for any CEO, of any business, is what I would call the operational skill set: how a company functions, how you recruit, how you grow, how you develop your people, how you promote them, how you compensate them, the decision-making processes, the leadership decisions you make…there’s a lot of operational stuff.", "Critically important as well is, of course, strategy. An effective CEO has not just a mission but a very clear and inspiring strategy for where a company is going.", "Our strategy is very clear. We want to build on and enhance our position as a leading international life science investor.", "That means allocating an even greater proportion of our investments toward life sciences. It also means moving into white space that we think we can capitalize on, such as a more systematic approach to growth equity.", "Another example would be our desire to establish a US presence for our Principal Investments team. We have an important US presence in Novo Ventures, with offices in Boston and San Francisco and we now need to replicate that for Principal Investments.", "Of course investing in Europe and the US are not mutually exclusive… So, we’re not taking anything away from Europe to invest in the US.", "But if you aspire to be a leading life science investor, you need to be investing in the US because that’s where a large part of the deal flow is.", "We’re already investing in the US in Principal Investments, and in fact, one of the biggest deals the group has done, the acquisition of the healthcare IT company ERT, was in the US.", "But as we grow that presence, there’s a limit to how much and how well we can effectively manage out of Copenhagen.", "You need to go beyond the virtual presence to manage the portfolio by having a presence on the ground, and we hope that we will be able to see more deal flow and capitalize on it a lot quicker.", "The venture team continues to demonstrate and deliver very good returns, and with the increasing amount of money — between $1.5B and $2B annually across all our life science teams– that we have to invest, we have to think creatively when it comes to venture about how we can deploy capital beyond just classic biotech ventures – because there’s a limit, right?", "If you’re already investing $350M a year, that’s a lot. But there’s not always necessarily enough quality deal flow, so one of the things we’ve been doing is broadening our horizons, and going into areas like digital health for the first time and getting more active in defined exit investments.", "I’d like to go back to the international mindset you mentioned… doing business in Denmark might seem challenging to foreigners not just from the usual intercultural perspective but also because of the strong presence of foundations.", "One of the unique features in Denmark is that many of the major corporates have a foundation as an important or majority shareholder.", "In some cases, there’s a family alongside the foundation, or family members are active in a foundation, though in the cases of Novo Holdings and Lundbeckfonden, there are no families.", "Even beyond pharma — Lego and Carlsberg, for instance — there’s a foundation.", "You can say it’s old-school, but it’s interesting – actually, we’re beginning to see other countries slowly adopt the foundation structure, rather than leaving all the inheritance to a family in which case it can be divided and subdivided.", "I think having a foundation ownership with a public listing creates a fantastic positive tension, particularly in healthcare.", "When you have a foundation, you can take long-term decisions and there’s a great arbitrage for creating value by thinking long-term when the rest of the world is thinking short-term.", "But, of course, being publicly-listed and having a share price — and having an element of management compensation tied to that share price — also means that you have to consider the short- and medium-term.", "So, I think publically listed foundation-backed companies actually create a very interesting dynamic that is arguably healthier than being either wholly foundation-controlled or wholly publicly-held.", "Major thanks to Kasim for making the time to speak with me! What questions would you have asked him?", "Images via Novo Nordisk, wara1982, Fat Jackey, Kavun Halya, tomtsya, S-F / shutterstock.com"]}

It is one of the first medicines developed based on the discovery of real-life mutants: people with variations in a gene called PCSK9 who have extremely low cholesterol levels and heart attack risk.", "Before Repatha was introduced, CVS Caremark, one of the largest managers of drug benefits for U.S. employers, warned that drugs like it could cost the U.S. healthcare system $200 billion.", "Yet Repatha sales last year were only $140 million globally. Praluent, a similar drug made by drug firms Sanofi and Regeneron, had sales of just $116 million.", "The hope among investors and cardiologists was be that this 27,564-patient study, presented this morning at the annual meeting of the American College of Cardiology in Washington, D.C., and published in the New England Journal of Medicine, would blow the barriers that keep patients from getting PCSK9 drugs.", "Now doctors, patients and insurance companies still struggle with the question: is Repatha worth the money?", "It wasn’t just genetics that got expectations for PCSK9 drugs hot. Reducing LDL as much as Repatha did should have resulted in a 31% reduction in heart attacks and strokes, says Sekar Kathiresan, a cardiologist and geneticist at Massachusetts General Hospital.", "So why was the result only 15%? One reason is the measure of success Amgen chose. In order to get more statistical power in clinical trials, drug companies and cardiologists often lump “hard” measures like heart attacks, strokes and deaths together with less important but more common problems like being hospitalized for chest pain or needing a stent to open a clogged artery.", "Repatha reduced the rate of heart attacks 27%, from 4.6 in 100 patients to 3.4 in 100 patients. It reduced stroke 21%, from 1.9 in 100 patients to 1.5 in 100.", "It reduced stents and heart bypass procedures 22%, from 7 in 100 to 5.5. But on hospitalizations for chest pain, it did nothing–1.7 of 100 people in both groups were hospitalized for chest pain.", "It may be that chest pain is no longer a good measure for clinical trials, says Marc Sabatine, the Brigham & Women’s Hospital cardiologist who led the study for Amgen.", "Blood tests can now detect whether people with chest pain are having heart attacks or need stents. Those hospitalized for chest pain may actually have other problems, like acid reflux.", "“You’re not going to intervene on heartburn,” says Sean Harper, Amgen’s head of research and development.", "But Repatha also didn’t impact a more important measure: whether patients lived longer. On Repatha, 1.8 of 100 patients died of cardiovascular causes; for placebo, that figure was 1.7.", "For the most part, these “cardiovascular causes” were not heart attacks and strokes, but sudden cardiac deaths, when a patient dies suddenly for unknown reasons.", "It could be that a cholesterol drug had no effect on sudden cardiac death. But only 0.4% of patients died from either a heart attack or stroke; the rates of fatal heart attacks and fatal strokes were actually better in the Repatha group, but were too small to draw conclusions.", "Doctors may just be better at preventing death compared to 20 years ago, when the first statin studies were run.", "It could be that Amgen rushed too fast, choosing to run a gigantic-but-short study to get quicker results.", "Trials in which statin drugs prevented deaths lasted five years. Patients were followed, on average, for a little more than two years in this study.", "For both statins and the PCSK9 drugs, it appears that effectiveness takes time to appear, and is half what it would be expected to be in later years, says Rory Collins, an Oxford epidemiologist who is one of the world’s top experts on cholesterol medicines.", "A shorter trial means a much lower effect as a result. What’s more, it may take time to prevent deaths by preventing buildup in the arteries.", "“The underestimation could be a duration effect,” Collins says. “And it could be really quite substantial.”", "That leads to the possibility that a longer trial might show better results. Sanofi and Regeneron are running a study of their PCSK9 drug, Praluent, in which all patients will take drug for at least two years.", "“My belief is whatever Amgen shows I hope we’ll have a better or higher result,” said Elias Zerhouni, the head of R&D at Sanofi, before seeing the Amgen results.", "A logjam in drug benefit plans has kept PCSK9 medicines from being used, even for patients who obviously need them.", "Take Cameron Credle, 30, a woodworker in Chapel Hill, N.C. At age three, he had a total cholesterol of 430 milligrams per deciliter, almost quadruple normal levels.", "(He has a genetic disease called familial hypercholesterolemia.) He’s spent his whole life trying to get his LDL down.", "Statins brought it down to about 250 mg/dL. It took him four months to get approval to try Praluent, the Sanofi/Regeneron drug.", "It gave him diarrhea. He spent another eight months getting approval for Repatha, instead taking samples of the drug his doctor obtained.", "He says his doctor’s office logged 15 hours of work to get him the medicine.", "Craig Davis, 57, the former chief information officer of the Veterans Affairs Medical Center in Orlando, Florida, also has familial hypercholesterolemia.", "He went on federal disability after his second coronary bypass surgery. Three decades ago, he learned his total cholesterol was 840 mg/dL and his LDL 420 mg/dL.", "He’s been on statins since they were introduced, and got five stents between when he was 35 and 40. His next option would be a heart transplant, his doctors tell him.", "He wanted to switch to Repatha from Juxtapid, a $300,000-a-year drug that was damaging his liver. Getting approval took weeks.", "Then, he changed insurers–and was denied again. “It was a bureaucratic nightmare, and that’s coming from a career bureaucrat,” Davis says.", "Both Credle and Davis were identified by the Global Healthy Living Foundation, a nonprofit that gets some funding from drug companies including Amgen.", "Both say they receive no compensation. Their stories show that there are people who would benefit from PCSK9 drugs who are clearly having trouble getting them.", "But the vast majority of patients are not at nearly as much risk.", "Answering the question of who should get Repatha is largely being left to the giant companies that manage drug benefit programs for insurers and employers, including CVS Caremark, Express Scripts and some units of UnitedHealthcare.", "Representatives of CVS and Express Scripts say they expect the results are good enough to drive increased use of the medicines.", "“If we sense the consensus is that this demonstrates there’s a substantial decrease in cardiac outcomes, it will increase the number of people increasing PCSK9 inhibitors,” says Troyen Brennan, the chief medical officer at CVS Caremark.", "Steven Miller, the chief medical officer at Express Scripts, says that part of the reason the drugs weren’t being prescribed is that doctors weren’t pushing very hard for them, even for the sickest patients.", "He thinks that will change. “Getting the patients approved had been difficult, and because there was no endpoint data many practitioners didn’t push very hard,” Miller says.", "“Now that there is endpoint data they are going to be pushing a lot harder to write these scripts.”", "Miller says Express Scripts has been working to make sure that patients who really need the PCSK9 drugs can get them.", "Half the denials of Repatha or Praluent at Express Scripts were because the company was asking doctors to send not just a lab value, but also an actual copy of a lab report.", "For a $14,000 drug, it seemed fair. But for doctors’ offices, this turned out to be difficult, because the lab report itself was not always in the medical record.", "Express Scripts has changed its requirements as a result, he says. Still, Miller says, companies like his are also \"stewards\" of their clients' cash.", "The question for many drugs is not whether Repatha prevents heart attacks–it clearly does–but whether that is worth the money.", "Sanjay Kaul, a cardiologist at Cedars Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles, calculates that it costs $2 million to prevent a heart problem (cardiologist jargon: an event) at Repatha’s list price.", "“Even with 50% price discount, $1 million per event prevented is too steep a price to justify!” he says.", "David Rind, chief medical officer of the Institute for Clinical and Economic Review, says it would be “surprising” if the new results make economic analyses of Repatha look better.", "“People care about more than just surviving,” counters James Stein, of the University of Wisconsin School of Medicine and Public Health.", "Adds Nissen, the Cleveland Clinic cardiologist: “We give very expensive cancer drugs that extend life for six weeks.", "I just want to be able to offer patients the best therapies that are available. I look after many patients after [heart attack], they go out and they try to do things and their exercise tolerance is never the same.", "I follow patients who have had a stroke and now walk with a cane. They’re alive, but their quality of life is never the same.", "Do I wish these drugs cost $4,000 a year instead for $14,000? I do.\"", "Says Yale’s Krumholz: “The drug has been priced on speculation, in my mind. What do you get from a 60 mg/dL reduction in cholesterol?", "People thought you’d eliminate heart disease. But that’s not what happened here. But you’re in the range of what happens with statins.", "If you’re giving me a new statin, we should be paying pretty much what we paid when the statins were introduced.", "Amgen, for its part, says that even at $14,000, Repatha is cost-effective. And it actually gets much less than that.", "Drugmakers pay rebates to pharmacy benefit managers; for a drug like Repatha, those rebates could be 30% or more.", "Many doctors say one of their main takeaways from the trial will just be that lower levels are better, no matter how low a heart patient’s LDL is.", "Ethan Weiss at UCSF says he will start reaching for generic Zetia, a generic Merck drug, before he ever goes for the PCSK9 shots.", "What that means for sales, which Wall Street analysts hope will pass $2 billion for both Repatha and Praluent, is not clear.", "Another factor for investors to consider: there is ongoing patent litigation between the two companies that almost led Praluent to be removed from the market.", "The debate over these amazing, potent and (still) potentially life-saving drugs is a snapshot of medicine in 2017.", "Science is great.

CCHCS appeals from that order.", "While this appeal was pending, the trial court sustained CCHCS’s demurrer to the mandamus cause of action with leave to amend.", "On appeal, CCHCS argues the trial court abused its discretion when it found, among other things, that Amgen had made a sufficient showing that its price increase notice met the definition of a trade secret despite its disclosure to more than 170 registered purchasers and an unknown number of customers of pharmacy benefit managers.", "CCHCS further contends the trial court erred in finding that the balance of hardships favored Amgen. Amgen argues the appeal is moot following its dismissal of the underlying mandamus action, and that the trial court correctly ruled that limited disclosure of the price increase notice to noncompetitors did not deprive the information included in the price increase notice of its trade secret status.", "We exercise our discretion to decide this otherwise moot appeal. The issues this appeal raises are capable of repetition because there will be future price increase notices.", "In addition, the issues are likely to evade review because a pharmaceutical manufacturer has little reason to continue to prosecute a mandamus action after obtaining a preliminary injunction for the 60-day period before a price increase becomes public.", "On the merits, we agree with CCHCS. Amgen has failed to demonstrate that once it disclosed its price increase information pursuant to Senate Bill No. 17, that information retained whatever status it may previously have had as a trade secret.", "First, Amgen has failed to show that its disclosure was limited. Senate Bill No. 17 and Health and Safety Code section 127677 place no limitation on the registered purchasers’ further dissemination of Amgen’s price increases during the 60-day period, including to Amgen’s competitors.", "Amgen provides no evidence that the registered purchasers have, or would, maintain the confidentiality of the price increase notice.", "Second, Amgen has failed to explain why, even if the price increase information were not disseminated to competitors, the registered purchasers, who sit opposite Amgen at the bargaining table, are not themselves capable of taking economic advantage of that information, thus inflicting the very harm Amgen claims a preliminary injunction would prevent.", "Indeed, as detailed below, the purpose of Health and Safety Code section 127677 was to allow the registered purchasers actively to prepare for upcoming price increases by, inter alia, finding cheaper alternatives to the drugs subject to the notices.", "Given Amgen’s failure to show its price increase information was still a trade secret after disclosure to the registered purchasers, we further conclude that the trial court abused its discretion in finding that the balance of harms favored Amgen.", "Accordingly, we reverse the trial court’s order granting the preliminary injunction.", "The Legislature passed Senate Bill No. 17 in 2017 to increase transparency into pharmaceutical pricing.", "The bill’s author stated, \"Expensive drugs and steady price increases are becoming commonplace with little transparency for astounding prices,\" and explained that Senate Bill No. 17 would \"shin[e] a light on drugs that are having the greatest impact on our health care dollar.\"", "(Sen.

As Amgen has made clear, its goal in this litigation was to prevent disclosure of its proposed price increases for the 60-day period before Amgen implemented the new prices.", "Once Amgen implemented the price increases, it could (and did) dismiss its reverse-CPRA action without jeopardizing its purported trade secrets.", "Nothing prevents Amgen from taking a similar approach to future price increase notices, in which case the trial and appellate courts would never reach the merits of the case.", "Amgen represents that it dismissed the underlying case not to avoid a ruling on the merits, but out of concern that changes in the content of its future notices might render any declaratory relief based on its current notice of limited use.", "We do not question Amgen’s motives. We merely note that a pharmaceutical manufacturer has little incentive to continue prosecuting an action to protect its price increase notice once it has implemented the price increases publicly.", "We further conclude that the interrelation of trade secret protections and Health and Safety Code section 127677 is an issue of substantial and continuing public interest, given the multiple legal actions taken by drug manufacturers to prevent disclosure of their price increase notices, the filing of three briefs by amici curiae in this case, and the fact that the disclosure in the case was sought by a prominent news organization.", "Amgen argues that CCHCS \"cannot invoke the discretionary exception to mootness because it voluntarily chose not to preserve the status quo pending this appeal\" when it opposed Amgen’s request to stay the trial court proceedings.", "Amgen cites Fair v. United States E.P.A. (9th Cir. 1986) 795 F.2d 851 ( Fair ), which declined to consider a moot appeal when it was \"unlikely that this controversy will arise again between these parties,\" and \"[t]he sole reason this case ‘evaded review’ is the appellants’ failure to take requisite action,\" such as posting a bond along with their request for a preliminary injunction or seeking a stay of the trial court’s judgment pending appeal.", "Fair is inapposite. As set forth above, the controversy at issue in this case is likely to arise again between these parties, and the appeal was rendered moot not through CCHCS’s inaction, but by Amgen’s decision to dismiss the underlying case, something CCHCS could not have prevented even had it agreed to stay the proceedings in the trial court.", "Amgen’s other cited cases do not support the proposition that application of the mootness exception depends on the appellant taking action to preserve the status quo.", "Instead, the courts in those cases declined to apply the exception because they were not persuaded the issues in the cases were likely to recur.", "(See Building a Better Redondo, Inc. v.

As the authorities cited above indicate, disclosure to others, who have no obligation to maintain confidentiality, will destroy a trade secret.", "As the party asserting the trade secret privilege, it was Amgen’s burden to establish that its price increase notice remained confidential despite disclosure to the registered purchasers and \"large\" customers of pharmacy benefit managers.", "At a minimum, this would have required some evidence that the purchasers did not, and would not, disclose the information to the general public or to those \"who can obtain economic value from its disclosure or use.\"", "( Civ. Code, § 3426.1, subd. (d)(1).) Amgen presented no evidence on this issue. The trial court instead relied on a purported lack of evidence of further disclosure, thus improperly shifting the burden of proof to CCHCS.", "Amgen argues that at the preliminary injunction stage, it need only show \" ‘a reasonable probability’ that it would prevail on the merits.\"", "This is so, but in the absence of any evidence whatsoever that Amgen’s price increase notice maintained its confidentiality after disclosure to the registered purchasers and others, the trial court had no basis to find Amgen had a probability of prevailing on that critical issue, much less a reasonable one.", "The trial court’s finding that Amgen’s disclosure was \"compelled\" does not affect our conclusion. The question here is not why Amgen disclosed its price increase notice, but whether that disclosure rendered the notice no longer confidential.", "Even assuming arguendo that the registered purchasers did not disseminate the price increase notice further, we would conclude that Amgen has failed to show that the notice maintained its purported trade secret status.", "Amgen has not explained why the registered purchasers, who directly or indirectly sit on the opposite side of the negotiating table from Amgen, are not themselves \"persons who can obtain economic value\" from advance knowledge of Amgen’s prospective pricing information.", "( Civ. Code, § 3426.1, subd. (d)(1).)

Thus, despite the disclosure, the trade secret holder could prevent another environmental organization from obtaining the information through a public records request.", "Masonite claimed trade secret status under statutes specific to air emissions information submitted to regulators, none of which is applicable to this case.", "(See Gov.

Amgen did so in compliance with a statutory regime that, far from protecting Amgen’s price information, required that it be disclosed to a long list of potentially adverse recipients with no limitations on those recipients’ use or further dissemination of the information.", "Amgen cannot claim to have been unaware of the possible consequences of its disclosure, including the loss of trade secret protections; trade groups opposed Senate Bill No. 17 precisely because it \"requires the disclosure of commercially sensitive pricing information\" \"without confidentiality protections.\"", "(Assem.

DVD Copy does not in fact apply this principle, concluding instead that the evidence indicated the Internet disclosure in that case likely reached millions of people.", "( Id. at p. 252, 10 Cal.

To enable survival in challenging financial times, reduce defects in their products, and to gain a competitive advantage, leading companies in the semi-conductor, consumer electronics, and automotive industries have effectively implemented simple, robust and sustainable quality systems.", "The rationale for quality systems in these cases are applicable to our industry, too, but beyond them, quality is crucially needed to ensure regulatory compliance and provide the patients we serve with high quality medicines.", "This is best achieved by creating a culture of quality that promotes its benefits, works cross-functionally, drives operational excellence, and implements new techniques and technologies.", "We need to continue get it right the first time, building quality processes from the start.", "At Amgen, we have invested considerably in quality processes and pioneering technologies to help ensure the continuous supply of our quality biologic therapies.", "Between 2005 and 2016, we project this investment will reach approximately $1.5 billion. Our strategy is clear and we have identified four key elements to help meet this commitment: prevention, which includes ensuring regulatory compliance, robust quality management processes, operational excellence, supply chain security, infrastructure investments, and business continuity planning; technology, to enhance product quality and purity and the robustness of the manufacturing process; inventory management, to ensure we have the right quantities of the product housed in diverse locations; and diversification of manufacturing capacity and implementation of second-sourcing within Amgen's network.", "Working with regulatory bodies is central to approaching the drug shortages challenge successfully. The formation of the FDA's Drug Shortages Task Force, to meet the requirements of the Safety and Innovation Act (FDASIA ), is a great example of how pooling new ideas can encourage high quality, and facilitate the expansion of manufacturing capacity.", "Amgen has contributed to the Task Force by sharing its own best practices, including the way we measure and monitor production time and the importance of applying the same high standards of quality management systems to contract manufacturing partners.", "We also believe that information about all companies' manufacturing quality should be made available and shared with purchasers, prescribers and consumers, to make informed choices that will help ensure a continuous and reliable supply of quality medicines to patients.", "The FDA can also help by assisting with faster and more streamlined product and technology approvals, facilitating greater transparency of compliance status of manufacturing sites with the public, reducing certain regulatory oversights and extending the interval between routine GMP inspections.", "4.

She had founded a start-up called Science Exchange, which uses a large network of contract labs to provide research support to scientists—and in some cases, check their work.", "She contacted the COS, and together, they launched the Reproducibility Project: Cancer Biology—an initiative that used the Science Exchange labs to replicate key results from the 50 most cited papers in cancer biology, published between 2010 and 2012.", "(The COS recently used the same model for psychology studies to good effect.)", "The results from the first five of these replication attempts were published today—and they offer no clean answers.", "Two of them largely (but not entirely) confirmed the conclusions of the original studies.

That is, for each targeted paper, they wrote up their experimental plans in full, ran them past the original authors, and submitted them to the journal eLife for peer review.", "Only then did they start the experiments. Once the results were in, they were reviewed a second time, before being published.", "The hardest part, by far, was figuring out exactly what the original labs actually did.

They’d just guess.", "If you asked 20 different labs to replicate a paper, you’d end up with 10 different methodologies that aren’t really comparable.”", "So, in every case, he had to ask the scientists behind the original experiments for the details of their work.", "Oftentimes, the person who actually did the experiments had left the lab, so an existing team member had to rummage through old notebooks or data files.", "The project ended up being hugely time-consuming for everyone concerned. “We spent a boatload of time trying to get back to ground zero,” says Errington.", "And for what? The results of the first five papers show just how hard it is to interpret a replication attempt in this field.", "For example, in 2012, Levi Garraway at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute found that melanoma skin cancers frequently carry mutations in a gene called PREX2.", "His team then showed that these mutations accelerate the growth of human melanoma cells that were transplanted onto mice.", "But replicating team couldn’t confirm the latter result; in their experiment, the PREX2 mutations made no difference.", "Does that mean that Garraway’s study was wrong? Not quite. Even though the replication team got their melanoma cells and mice from the same source as Garraway’s group, in their hands, the transplanted tumours grew much faster than had been reported.", "The PREX2 mutations made no difference because all the cells were already zooming along in sixth gear.", "Small differences in the ways the cells were grown or the mice were housed could have contributed to the differences between these studies, writes Roger Davis, a cell biologist at the University of Masschussetts Medical School, reviewed the PREX2 replication paper.", "In another case, Irving Weissman from Stanford Medicine showed that cancer cells carry high levels of a protein called CD47, and antibodies that target this protein can slow the growth of human tumor cells that had been transplanted into mice.", "In this case, the replication experiment was inconclusive because all the transplanted tumors would spontaneously regress, antibodies or no.", "Some might argue that these differences arise because the project relied on contractors, who lack the experience and artisanal skills of the scientists in the original teams.", "Iorns disagrees. “The teams were all selected for their technical expertise in the experiments being conducted,” she says.", "“They routinely run these types of experiments all the time.”", "Instead, she and Errington argue that the differences stem from the inherent and underappreciated variability of the cells and animals being used in these studies.", "In psychology, researchers who replicate a study have no choice but to recruit different volunteers, who might differ from the original sample in critical ways.", "But in theory, cancer biologists should be able to use the exact same lineage of cells or breed of rodents—genetically identical and sourced from the same suppliers—which should behave in the same way.", "“But some of these models kind of fell apart, and you can’t dismiss that,” says Errington. He hopes that these results will spur other scientists to better explore those variations, and include more quality control steps in their work.", "And perhaps the most important result from the project so far, as Daniel Engber wrote in Slate, is that it has been “a hopeless slog.”", "“If people had deposited raw data and full protocols at the time of publication, we wouldn’t have to go back to the original authors,” says Iorns.", "That would make it much easier for scientists to truly check each other’s work.", "The National Institutes of Health seem to agree. In recently released guidelines, meant to improve the reproducibility of research, they recommend that journals ask for more thorough methods sections and more sharing of data.", "And in this, the Reproducibility Project have modelled the change they want to see, documenting every step of their project on a wiki.", "“We want to applaud replication efforts like this,” says Atul Butte from the University of California, San Francisco, whose study was among the two that were successfully reproduced.", "“It is important for the public to have trust in scientists, and belief in the veracity of our published findings.”", "But he suggests that the team chooses their targeted studies in a “more impactful manner”—not by citations, but by those that are most likely to lead to new treatments.", "In the meantime, the team still needs to finish its first wave of replications.

It was discovered accidentally, by biotech scientists looking for drugs that would tamp down the immune response in patients with autoimmune disease, and would stimulate, not block, PD1.", "Even after a potent PD1 inhibitor was identified and recognized as a potential cancer drug, the research program had to fight for funding through two mergers and acquisitions.", "After the program finally wound up at Merck, in 2009, it was considered such a low priority that it was shut down and placed on the out-license list.", "A term sheet (valuing the program at next to nothing) was reportedly in place, but pulled at the last minute, as promising results from competitor Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMS) motivated a reconsideration of the mechanism.", "A remarkably rapid drug development program ensued, initiated under Peter Kim and in close partnership with the FDA, ultimately under the brand-new breakthrough designation program.", "Merck–in effort to close what it perceived as a four- or five-year gap with BMS–opted to pursue a companion diagnostic program for the use of pembro in lung cancer patients, a decision intensely questioned not only by investors, but also by the new Merck research leadership when they joined in 2013.", "In the end, the companion diagnostic program was retained, and while critiqued by the Wall Street Journal as recently as March 2016, it ultimately proved to be vital, catapulting Merck ahead of BMS when the BMS drug failed in first-line therapy for lung cancer among less stringently selected patients, while Merck succeeded brilliantly by focusing on the 30% of patients deemed most likely to respond.", "While drug development is often viewed as a simple linear exercise of progressing science from laboratory to clinic, the reality is generally far more circuitous, involving more uncertainty and luck than is typically appreciated.", "But it’s not just luck; as pembro demonstrates, success is ultimately dependent upon people--in particular the internal champions who urge a program forward and the senior executives who are willing to get fully behind a program, own the difficult decisions and stake their careers on the molecule’s success.", "When Greg Carven was a chemistry graduate student at MIT in the late 1990s, his first project was to crystallize a cell surface structure involved in immune recognition–the class II MHC molecule HLA-DR1.", "After several years of intensive work, however, he found himself abruptly scooped by a lab in Slovenia.", "It had elegantly solved the structure, and Carven was left to cast about for a new project. Ultimately, he decided to focus his dissertation on the examination of HLA-DR1 using exquisitely specific antibodies as elegant probes, enabling him to detect subtle differences in the molecule's conformation.", "After graduation, Carven started working at an oncology startup in Waltham, Massachusetts–but the company “failed miserably” according to Carven, and after a year, he was out looking for another job.", "He found one at a biotech company in Cambridge called Organon, a 20-person outpost of a larger, 20,000-person Dutch pharmaceutical company headquartered in Oss, Netherlands.", "Organon itself was the health products division of a much larger, Amsterdam-based conglomerate, Akzo Nobel, that was focused primarily on paints.", "Organon sold products related to women’s health, neurology and anesthesia; their R&D operations were led by David Nicholson (now chief R&D officer at Allergan), who told me the Cambridge operation represented an effort to leverage the company’s expertise in antibodies–previously used by the company for target validation–to develop novel therapeutics.", "When Carven joined the company, he focused on raising antibodies against the cell surface protein PD1, hoping to find agonists–molecules that activate the receptor and thus turn T-cells off, suppressing overly exuberant responses in patients with autoimmune disease.", "This project was originally initiated in Oss in the lab of Andrea van Elsas, who explained to me:", "Organon’s PD1 antibody program was conceived in 2003 as part of an antibody portfolio we were setting up to support Organon's core objectives which included autoimmune disease (rheumatoid arthritis and other) but not oncology.", "The antibody portfolio was initiated in the Netherlands in my group in preparation of moving to Cambridge, MA (mid-2005).", "The PD1 program ultimately yielded no good agonists but exceptional antagonists.", "When Carven and team recognized they had identified promising PD1 antagonists, they were not immediately sure what to do.", "There was much skepticism in the world around immuno-oncology, yet also strong protagonists, including the legendary researcher Jim Allison, an immunologist who believed strongly in targeting immune molecules such as CTLA4, the target of ipilimumab (Yervoy), which was developed initially by Medarex (later acquired by BMS) and ultimately approved in 2011 for the treatment of refractory melanoma.", "While the response rates were fairly low, the responses that were seen were often unusually durable.", "But these encouraging data were still several years in the future, and the Organon team considered a range of potential uses for the PD1 antagonist, including as an antiviral agent and as a vaccine enhancer.", "Ultimately, however, the team coalesced around the oncology indication and persuaded Organon management to go along–presumably an easy sell, since according to Nicholson, Organon leadership was interested in using antibodies as cancer therapeutics.", "As van Elsas (who was just appointed Chief Scientific Officer of Aduro Biotech) put it:", "With my academic history in anti-CTLA4 (even though, clinically, cancer immunotherapy was still highly controversial at the time), and with a growing appreciation for the portfolio's potential in oncology, we had enough reasons to pivot to oncology.", "The team set to work on a validation package for the most promising asset in this program, a humanized version of a highly potent and selective antibody, which would come to be known as pembro, in anticipation of new drug filing (known as an investigation new drug, or IND, application).", "Unfortunately, as work was continuing, Organon was acquired by Schering Plough in 2007, reportedly to plug a gap in Schering’s phase 2 pipeline.", "While “no one had given much thought to the preclinical programs in either company,” as one researcher put it, the acquisition inevitably led to an integration process associated with a re-prioritization of all the combined assets.", "The PD1 program reportedly emerged with a very low ranking among all the oncology activities–“low if not dead last” one scientist said, “because nothing in tumor immunology ever worked.”", "Nevertheless, the program retained its champions–most prominently, van Elsas–and was permitted to continue and prove its value to skeptical but convincible Schering executives.", "As encouraging results began to come in, the team collaborated with the oncology group at Schering to again work on the IND application, the prerequisite for clinical studies.", "Just when it seemed like the team was starting to gain momentum, Schering itself was acquired by Merck in 2009, initiating, of course, a new reprioritization process for the integrated companies.", "This time, the PD1 program was less fortunate, and the team was told to stop work. Yet, they persisted–in skunkworks fashion, variously pitching their work as an oncology project, an antiviral project and a vaccine enhancement project.", "Eventually, however, management caught on and formally shut down their work. The molecule was placed on the out-license list, and ultimately a term sheet was drafted setting the terms for a specific interested party to obtain rights to the molecule at what was said to be a negligible cost.", "Everything changed, however, by the middle of 2010. First, BMS published in the New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM) a successful Phase III study in refractory metastatic melanoma involving ipilimumab (Yervoy), a drug targeting the different but related T-cell inhibitor molecule CTLA4, pointing to the potential efficacy of the so-called “checkpoint inhibitor” approach.", "Second, word began to filter through to Merck that nivolumab, or nivo (brand name: Opdivo), an earlier-stage molecule targeting PD1 that BMS also acquired though its recent acquisition of Medarex, was showing signs of promise.", "From what was literally a standing stop, Merck urgently reactivated IND development in mid-2010, targeting a filing by the end of the year and achieving it in December.", "Enrollment in the first study began in early 2011. Eric Rubin–who, in an interesting twist of fate, did his oncology training at Dana Farber with Thomas Lynch, who now leads R&D at BMS–was the head of clinical oncology at the time and would eventually become the clinical lead for the program.", "Development of pembro was unlike any program in Merck’s history. For starters, the team realized they were years behind BMS; one researcher told me they calculated that BMS must have filed their IND for nivo in 2006.", "But Merck had an aggressive plan, and benefited from unusually good timing.", "The pembro phase 1 program began like any other; the first-in-human study was a simple dose escalation, designed primarily to understand the safety and tolerability of the new medicine in patients with a range of advanced cancers.", "Efficacy was also examined in a preliminary fashion, typical for phase 1 studies. When early results suggested some melanoma patients–already suspected to be good fit for PD1 mechanism–seemed to be responding to the drug, an expansion cohort, focused entirely on advanced melanoma patients, was added.", "The results from the melanoma cohort were striking. According to UCLA’s Antoni Ribas, a key investigator in this advanced melanoma study:", "Among the first 7 patients we enrolled, 6 patients had objective responses. I realized I was probably lucky and this high rate of responses would not hold up forever, but also realized that [pembro] was different from all the other cancer immunotherapy we had tested to date, all of which had response rates in the 10-15% range.", "Ribas then started sending before and after scans to the Merck team running the study, urging them to share with upper management.", "He worried Merck was “going too slow in recognizing how important this was.”", "Merck scientists involved in the program tell me they needed little prodding from Ribas, saying they were acutely aware of the both the potential clinical utility of their drug and the commercial need to close the gap with a competitor who seemed to be years ahead.", "Ribas emphasizes his “main concern was that the study as designed had very few additional patients to enter, and I could not go to sleep if the trial closed and I would have suitable patients who could respond like the others and no slots for them.”", "His pleading apparently dovetailed with the strategy on which Merck had embarked. As Ribas notes, the study “eventually grew to include 655 patients with metastatic melanoma and a similar number of patients with lung cancer, becoming the largest phase 1 trial ever done in oncology.”", "(Note: This extraordinary Phase 1 study was recently summarized by Eric Rubin and colleagues in the Annals of Oncology.)", "Merck’s decision to focus on melanoma seems to reflect both scientific and commercial considerations.", "Melanomas had already demonstrated responsiveness to ipilimumab (Yervoy)–recall that this targets CTLA4, a different but related T cell off switch–so there was reason to believe pembro would work in this cancer as well.", "Commercially, Merck was terribly concerned by how far they were behind BMS’ nivo, and thought–from the time it filed its original IND in 2010–that its best chance to get to market rapidly was by focusing on refractory melanoma patients; in particular, it thought that if it could demonstrate its drug was effective in patients failed by all known treatments–including ipilimumab–it might be able to develop the drug in a single-arm trial–without a comparator arm.", "While normally drugs need to demonstrate superiority to placebo or to standard of care, patients who have been failed by all existing options by definition have no viable alternative.", "A new medicine that demonstrates compelling success in such a population might garner rapid approval.", "Merck had another ace up its sleeve as well. At a safety conference in Japan in 2012, the head of non-clinical safety, Joseph DeGeorge–who earlier in his career had spent 13 years at the FDA–learned from FDA colleagues how they intended to apply and implement a pathway called breakthrough designation (BTD), designed to accelerate and rationalize the approval of new drugs for unmet needs.", "While BTD does not mandate any specific schedule acceleration for molecules accepted into this category, it fundamentally changes the relationship between the FDA and the company developing the drug.", "Meetings can occur with greater frequency, and–most significantly–the FDA works in much closer partnership with the company to identify the most efficient path to approval (while not changing the specific approval standards).", "With its promising early results in advanced melanoma, Merck applied for and, in January 2013, received BTD status for Keytruda in this indication–a fact it did not immediately publicize, as it didn’t want to alert potentially drowsy competitors to the possibility of using this novel regulatory mechanism.", "In speaking with a number of Merck scientists, it appears one of the key benefits of BTD status was to backstop the pembro-inspired shakeup of Merck’s historically conservative and linear drug development mindset and assure Merck that its new approach–involving doing more work at risk, and with far greater agility–was regarded favorably by regulators and represented a move in the right direction.", "As the melanoma work was proceeding, the Merck team–motivated by promising results nivo was reporting–considered the potential benefit of the drug in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and added cohorts to the phase 1 study to explore this possibility, specifically the use of pembro as second-line therapy.", "The expansion of the pembro program at Merck created a logistical challenge for the company. At the time, Merck was hardly an oncology powerhouse, and it just didn’t have enough people in its clinical development organization to throw at the growing need.", "On the other hand, the intrinsic excitement of the program motivated some to step up. The lung program, for example, would be led by a seasoned veteran, Martin Huber, who had led oncology programs in lung cancer more than decade earlier, and had worked his way to a senior role, director of pharmacovigilance at Merck.", "In this role, he was also on a review committee for compounds in clinical development and quickly recognized both the promise of the drug and the need for his involvement.", "He stepped out of his management role and into the arena, leading the pembro NSCLC program.", "When Merck started the lung cancer program, they viewed themselves as years behind BMS and thought their only chance for rapid approval would be to demonstrate unusually high response rates in second-line therapy.", "The challenge was how to achieve this–and they turned to a biomarker.", "Merck’s instinct to utilize a biomarker in clinical development is hardly surprising; a hallmark of Peter Kim’s tenure at Merck was a strong emphasis on biomarkers–molecular signposts that can be used to segment patient populations, either to identify those most (or least) likely to respond or to get an early indication that a new drug is behaving as expected.", "(A quick aside: I had a front row seat to Merck’s embrace of biomarkers during the Kim years; I worked in Merck’s newly-formed Department of Experimental Medicine from 2006-2008 and developed a firsthand appreciation for both the possibility and the limitations of biomarkers in clinical development.)", "In this case, Merck turned to a molecule called PDL1, which is expressed on the surface of a number of cells, including some tumor cells, and is the natural ligand of PD1.", "The hope was that by selecting patients with tumors that expressed high levels of PDL1, they could achieve increased efficacy.", "(This was based on empiric observations, including those reported by nivo researchers, as well as the thought that if a tumor doesn’t express PDL1, it’s less likely that the PD1 pathway has been upregulated.)", "It was never exactly clear why PDL1 expression should predict efficacy–a relationship that to this day remains unclear and the subject of intensive discussion.", "The decision to utilize a biomarker for clinical development is often fraught, and was particularly so here, for a combination of commercial, scientific and humanistic reasons.", "In general, commercial teams tend not to favor biomarkers and seek to avoid them wherever possible. They would rather target an entire population than a subpopulation, and also recognize the inconvenience of requiring a patient to get tested prior to using a drug.", "All things being equal, a doctor would prefer to prescribe a drug immediately, without waiting for a test to be ordered and the results received and interpreted.", "But all things are rarely equal; the ability to define a population that responds well to a drug can result in clinical trials that yield far more impressive results–and require far fewer patients to demonstrate that the drug is effective.", "In this case, the Merck team felt they were years behind BMS in lung cancer and thought their only way to stay relevant was to use an effective biomarker to identify a subgroup of patients that would respond in a such a compelling fashion that regulators would be impressed and would want to ensure the drug was available as soon as possible to serve this defined group of patients.", "Scientifically, the challenge is that biomarkers are rarely perfect, and the PDL1 biomarker assay was perhaps a bit messier than most–yet Merck believed that it had developed a reliable assay that could support clinical development and incorporated this in yet another arm of its ever-expanding phase 1 study.", "Humanistically, the challenge is that by requiring the use of a companion diagnostic, or biomarker, patients who test negative generally cannot receive the drug.", "This makes sense if the biomarker works perfectly, but if not, it means you are effectively denying the drug to patients who might benefit.", "As Alise Reicin, a Merck executive who oversaw much of the early pembo program (and is now SVP and head of global clinical development at EMD Sorono) recalls, “We heard from physicians that late-line lung cancer patients had no options, so even if they had only a 7-8% chance of responding\" because the tumors did not express high levels of PDL1, the doctors still \"wanted the option to use the drug.”", "At the time the pembro team was engaging in these internal debates, Roger Perlmutter replaced Peter Kim as head of Merck Research Labs; many of Perlmutter’s former Amgen colleagues soon joined him, and one of their first tasks was reviewing the pembro development program.", "According to a number of scientists, the new leadership team was very concerned about the biomarker approach that had been adopted.", "Some speculated that perhaps the new leadership team felt it had been burned by previous challenging experiences with biomarkers at Amgen, possibly during the development and commercialization of Amgen’s Vectibix.", "But many were convinced the main worry about the use of the PDL1 assay was scientific–which was how Perlmutter himself explained his concerns.", "“Decisions in early research are based on scientific, not commercial, considerations,” Perlmutter told me, adding that from the outset, he embraced the idea of a biomarker for the lung program, but wanted to be sure it worked.", "As Perlmutter explained, while PDL1 is the natural ligand of PD1, the biology is not so straightforward.", "Drugs that block PD1 may be especially effective in tumors with high levels of PDL1 because PDL1 itself may be a surrogate marker for local inflammation–it’s upregulated in the presence of inflammatory cytokine interferon gamma, Perlmutter points out.", "After considerable review and often-anguished debate, Perlmutter and colleagues backed the continued use of the biomarker in the NSCLC second-line program (the first studies had already kicked off by the time Perlmutter joined in April, 2013)–as well as in another, extremely important (and hugely valuable) set of studies evaluating the use of Keytruda as first-line therapy for NSCLC.", "Even after this decision was made, it wasn’t clear it was the right choice; BMS, for example, had elected to develop its PD1 agonist for lung without a biomarker–a decision that as recently as March 2016 was seen as yielding better results; consider this lede from the Wall Street Journal: “Bristol-Myers Squibb has sprinted to an early lead in the race to sell a new class of cancer treatment by bucking the trend toward precision medicine.”", "The authors go on to observe that “Bristol has outflanked Merck partly by sticking to the old, mass-marketing approach.”", "However, these results were for second-line therapy; when the results for pembro and nivo for first-line NSCLC were reported in 2016, there was a shock: Merck’s study was strongly positive, while the BMS study–which used a biomarker, but with a far lower threshold–failed, a result that stunned many observers but seemingly vindicated Merck’s approach.", "The Merck team also used PDL1 levels to prioritize which tumors to target next; a preliminary study of the top four–head and neck, bladder, triple negative breast cancer and gastric cancer–led to promising results and dedicated studies in each of these indications (although the phase 3 program in advanced head and neck cancers reported negative results this week).", "An even more expansive program–evaluating pembro in a number of other advanced tumors, selected based on measured PDL1 level, soon followed.", "While the pembro clinical development program began under Kim, and was even placed on accelerated or “gold track” status internally, the key impact Perlmutter had on the program was recognizing it as an exceptional asset and redirecting virtually all work at Merck towards this program.", "According to Perlmutter, “I told everyone in research: stop what you’re doing now. We’ve got to do this.”", "The organization got the message, and stories of Permultter’s emphasis on Keytruda abound. According to one scientist, Perlmutter reportedly said, “I don’t want to wake up in five years and wish I blew another $1 billion on this drug.”", "Former Merck executive Reicin recalls presenting Perlmutter with a prioritized list of potential Keytruda clinical studies and asking him, based on resources, where to draw the line.", "“There is no line,” Perlmutter reportedly responded. “Do them all.”", "I asked Perlmutter about this, and he told me that given the melanoma results, you “didn’t need to be a genius” to figure out “there was something special here,” and to realize pembro had significant promise.", "But what Perlmutter did that was distinctive was take this logic one step further. When he stepped back from the details of the program and considered the big picture, he recognized that pembro wasn’t just a promising product in Merck’s portfolio–it was more valuable than the entire rest of the portfolio put together.", "His resourcing of pembro work, to the exclusion of most other activities, reflected this conviction. “When you realize the potential of something like this,” he explained to me, “you need to bet your career on it.”", "It was Pasteur who famously observed that fortune favors the prepared mind–and Merck was the beneficiary of just this sort of good fortune when pembro leaders received a call from legendary Johns Hopkins cancer researcher Bert Vogelstein, saying, “We need to talk.”", "One of Vogelstein’s colleagues at Hopkins, Suzanne Topalian, had just completed a clinical study of the BMS PD1 inhibitor nivo and was struck by a couple of observations.", "First, melanoma and NSCLC patients seemed to respond better than other tumor types. Second, while few patients with colorectal cancer (CRC) responded, the one CRC response that was observed was unusually durable.", "Vogelstein explains that he and his genetically oriented colleagues immediately had an idea: both melanomas and NSCLC–associated as there are with mutagens like sunlight and cigarette smoke, respectively–typically have many more mutations than other cancers.", "Cancers with high “mutational burdens” are more likely to have recognizable novel antigens–called mutation-associated neoantigens, or MANAs–to which T-cells can respond.", "Perhaps, Vogelstein and his fellow geneticists suggested, the patient with CRC suffered from a relatively rare form of the cancer associated with a defect in mismatch repair, resulting in a similarly high mutational burden.", "If you test the patient with CRC who responded to the PD1 drug, Vogelstein predicted, I bet he’ll have the molecular signature of mismatch repair–a finding known as “MSI-High.”", "Sure enough, the patient was tested and found to have this marker.", "Vogelstein told me that he and his colleagues promptly drafted a letter to a “prominent medical journal,” articulating their theory–and almost immediately it was rejected as mere conjecture.", "So Vogelstein picked up the phone and proposed a study to Merck; Hopkins would both conduct and pay for the study, he said.", "All Merck needed to do was provide the drug–which at this point had not yet been approved for any indication.", "Merck agreed, and the results–as Gina Kolata eloquently describes in a recent New York Times article–confirmed the investigators’ hypothesis, leading ultimately, in May 2017, to an unprecedented type of FDA approval for pembro–authorizing its use in a wide range of cancers, based on the presence of the MSI-high signature–“the FDA’s first tissue/site-agnostic approval,” according to the agency.", "- Vast Distance Between Discovery and Commercialization. It can be really hard to know in advance what discovery projects will succeed.", "When pembro was initiated, it began as a search for autoimmune therapeutics, looking for PD1 agonists.", "Even once an attractive PD1 antagonist was identified and recognized as potential oncology drug, it’s potential wasn’t obvious to either Schering Plough, when it acquired Organon, or to Merck, when it acquired Schering.", "Again, this is hardly unusual: When Millennium acquired Leukosite in 1999, for example, it was primarily for alemtuzumab (Campath); no one at either company likely appreciated at the time that Millennium also acquired a future blockbuster, bortezomib (Velcade).", "- History Linearized Over Time. The often circuitous history of drug development inevitably gets polished and more linear over time; lucky breaks and even fortunate missteps get cast as more intentional than they really were.", "The story told by the researchers in the trenches is generally much grittier than the version to which senior executives often cleave.", "- People Matter. Drugs neither discover nor develop themselves; the ultimate success of pembro is unquestionably attributable to a series of champions who believed in the possibility of the molecule and strove to enable it to demonstrate its potential.", "Every person with whom I spoke seemed to go out of their way to highlight several “unsung heroes”–frequently citing distinct sets of names.", "- Circumstances Matter. I’m especially struck by the role of Roger Perlmutter in the story of pembro–not because he was involved in the discovery or early development of the molecule, but because of his decision to bet both his career and Merck’s enterprise on this program.", "Every person to whom I spoke–which included a mixture of fans and critics–spoke of the singular impact of this decision.", "Less obvious, however, is how best to contextualize this choice. Perhaps any new leader who saw the early compelling data would make a similar decision.", "Conversely, maybe the program’s success is directly attributable to his intrinsically good judgment and instinctive boldness–and this is the sort of decision he would have made any time in his career.", "Or maybe it reflects decades of experience in drug development–he had the perspective to recognize something truly special when he saw it.", "Or perhaps you are more likely to bet your career on a decision when you’re in what’s likely the last (and also the most coveted) role of your career, and realize you have a limited amount of time to make your name; perhaps under these circumstances, you are more likely to place a big bet–and also more likely (as some have observed) to prioritize a white-hot present-day program rather than invest your time and resources in discovery-stage research that’s unlikely to bear fruit during your tenure, if at all.", "With so many possibilities, it feels like a bit like “choose your own narrative–pharma executive edition.”", "- Relationships With Regulators Matter. Merck researchers involved with the early pembo clinical program were struck by the impact of working closely in partnership with regulators, rather than the more typical relationship, which tends to be more adversarial.", "As DeGeorge put it, “Regulators really want to get important new drugs to patients quickly,” a sentiment shared by many members of the pembro team.", "As the researchers describe it, the FDA didn’t relax its criteria but helped the development team understand what the agency was looking for, and what approaches might best get them there.", "It’s a shame most drug development isn’t this synergistic–but it’s also a shame most drugs aren’t this impactful.", "(Some critics worry such collegial drug development may not be in the best interests of patients; FDA oncology leaders discuss the issue thoughtfully in this 2016 NEJM commentary.)", "- Agility Matters. Pembro’s rapid route to market and to patients reflects a commitment by Merck to develop this drug in what many pembro team members described as a conspicuously un-Merck-like fashion, foreshadowing a more general trend in the industry where, as FDA oncology leaders observed in NEJM, “the three distinct sequential phases of [cancer] drug development have...become increasingly blurred.”", "One example cited by former Merck executive Reicin: going into a confirmatory phase 3 study for advanced melanoma (and before pembro received accelerated [contingent] approval for this indication), the team wasn’t sure about the exact dose (2mg/kg vs 10 mg/kg, each every third week) or the regimen (10mg/kg every two weeks or every three weeks), as the cohorts looking at this in early phase studies hadn’t yet read out.", "Rather than test all three possibilities in each of two phase 3 studies–a more traditional approach–Reicin notes that Merck tested the two doses in one phase 3 study and the two regimens in the second, with the permission of the FDA.", "It then examined the combined data set to make the final determination (it turned out the two doses and two regimens all worked about the same).", "Without a willingness to contemplate such trial designs–and without the willingness of the FDA to consider them–the trial would unquestionably have taken far longer, and involved many more patients.", "- Ars Longa. The story of PD1 antognists, and of immunoloncology, has just begun, and no one knows how it will ultimately play out.", "The role of PDL1 as a biomarker remains the subject of much discussion. Merck researchers tend to attribute the use of this biomarker to their high response rates in both second- and first-line NSCLC, yet at least some data from BMS suggests the same biomarker–measured by a different assay–is less determinative (even when the same cutpoint is used as a criterion in an exploratory evaluation–see this recent NEJM paper).", "Vogelstein, for his part, shares Perlmutter’s original sense that the PD1 story is about more than PDL1 levels, telling me “there’s something about the whole process that’s yet to be discovered.”", "Keytruda’s recently reported and unexpected failure in patients with advanced head and neck cancer speaks to the degree of uncertainty that remains.", "- Translational Impact. Ultimately, the goal of most academic and industry cancer researchers alike is to translate their insight into patient impact.", "Vogelstein provided a poignant example, describing a graduate student with Lynch Syndrome (an inherited disorder of DNA repair leading to a high mutation rate and often gastrointenstinal tumors) who had developed CRC in his 20s and metastatic disease by his 30s.", "Available therapies no longer worked, and he was scheduled to be admitted to hospice on Friday. On Wednesday, however, the patient got word that his tumor tested positive for MSI-high, meaning that he was now a good candidate for pembro.", "He responded incredibly well to the medicine, Vogelstein said, and in the last four years, has gotten married and moved away to start his life anew.", "Stories like this may remain the exception, but also highlight the transformative potential of biomedical innovation."]}

I am not exaggerating: the end game out here is to take the IP and move the business to the east coast, preferably Boston.", "What Beth and I want to do is capture the IP at Yale University, to use a hypothetical example, and move the business out here, where we can be present and active at the gestation phase and beyond.", "In some cases, a company founder might want to retain a lab relationship at a university outside of the Los Angeles region, but the root and branch enterprise should be here.", "IV: Ken Schultz, CEO of Trethera Inc. and member of In Vivo’s Editorial Advisory Board: Don’t you anticipate some challenges to the model, especially the absence of homegrown expertise in areas like general management, regulatory or contract manufacturing services?", "Are there gaps that will force start-ups to look elsewhere for roots in places with that diversity of talent?", "Harper: The local talent situation is improving. Amgen is working hard to create an ecosystem of biopharma human capital in the Los Angeles region that can match Boston or the Bay area.", "As the most recent head of Amgen R&D, I’d get emails every day from people in the industry who are looking to relocate to the area because of a spouse that has landed a management job in the services sector here, which is as large or larger than other US metro areas; or I went to med school out here but did my post-doc at MIT and want to come back.", "Amgen, for example, has recruited great people from everywhere, in diverse fields related to life sciences in general.", "With time, it has forged a pool of expertise that gets larger every year. At Westlake Village BioPartners, our record so far speaks for itself: five companies started and we’re still rolling.", "IV: Since you have moved to active VC investor from the research lab, what have you witnessed in terms of new science?", "Harper: The trajectory of industry innovation is often one of long fallow periods followed by a spurt of explosive growth.", "This is true of biology. Innovation in human therapeutics was flat for decades but is now producing exponential returns.", "Gene therapy is a great example: it languished and was even abandoned after some bad safety signals in the 1990s but in the last five years it has become a viable treatment path starting with two FDA approved products in 2017.", "Today, there are some 350 companies active in the field, with hundreds of products undergoing clinical trials.", "We are in a new golden age of drug development, paced by computational biology, robotics and so many other technologies that add up to a far more predictable pathway to treatments that actually work in patients.", "It is a far cry from what I thought was possible in human therapeutics a decade ago. What really excites me are all the new technology platforms like human genome sequencing, including the ability to sequence individual tumors as an entry point for precision medicine.", "Computing power brings the capacity to take target discovery and validation beyond the mice models directly to humans.", "That’s a transformative change itself. One of the best things we did at Amgen was to acquire Iceland’s deCODE Genetics, a major source of population-based data that provided us with the information necessary to identify drug targets from large-scale screening of genes associated with many common diseases.", "When we bought deCODE, no one had been able to sequence an entire population – some 300,000 people – in all its genetic diversity to obtain those targets.", "Now we can. In my view, it gives Amgen’s R&D team a deeper understanding of the underlying biology of disease, putting them much closer to finding cures.", "But this is not all. Back when I was a post-doc at MIT, we could spend 10 years solving the crystal structure of a single protein.", "Today, the technology exists to structure the smallest molecule in that protein or to co-crystalize different proteins interacting with each other – an inter-disciplinary feat that bridges the physics of movement with biology.", "And a single company can produce 500 of these in a single year, not a decade. I know that artificial intelligence and machine learning get over-hyped, but these are emerging fields that already show promise in advancing unheard of efficiencies in areas like clinical trials.", "Add this up and you see that science and technology are working together to bend the curve on what’s possible for patients.", "There is vast potential for investors willing to get into the weeds for a closer look.", "IV: With that in mind, in an era where science opportunities are abundant but moving fast, how do you handle the due diligence work that is essential to striking the best deal?", "Harper: No doubt about it – it’s hard, for several reasons. First, the sheer volume of activity out there makes the search for innovation seem like entering a labyrinth with a blindfold on.", "You can look at interesting technology coming from the universities, where claims abound that the next generation of cell-based therapy is about to spring from their labs.", "But good luck in trying to compare the formal academic work with what’s going inside the walls of dozens and dozens of privately-held companies, many of which have been founded by academics, and also have the abundant capitalization to ensure they can operate for years in stealth mode.", "Second, the money flowing into biotech adds an extra measure of uncertainty because it raises the stakes in being able to find a truly innovative, commercially differentiated drug.", "You have to account for the herd mentality – going all-in on cell-based cancer therapies – that raises the bar on success in getting beyond the hype.", "This does not mean due diligence is impossible. VC firms can provide the expert oversight, technical tools and input on how to administer the process.", "The challenge is putting the diligence in context, particularly in those crowded therapeutic fields popular with investors.", "In fact, we believe it falls to old-fashioned intuition in making that crucial distinction of whether an asset opportunity is incremental or potentially transformative.", "What we know is, in an over-capitalized field, a transformative technology – say, CAR-T 2.0 – is going to be the investment that makes a difference in the long game.", "It can’t be a tweak in the current standard of care; and Beth and I do not want to make a play in that space.", "In all honesty, the lack of clarity in assessing commercial prospects in this brave new world of biotech discovery is what keeps me up at night.", "There is no clear line of sight into what all those private companies are doing, though an extra measure of accumulated experience and street smarts can help in making sense of it.", "Schultz: Many of our readers are CEOs or CSOs. You have taken a career path that now seems in vogue, moving from a big pharma firm to a smaller VC or start-up.", "How have you managed that transition and what advice might you offer to our readers?", "Harper: The opportunity set in biopharma has changed significantly. Today is a true golden age in the history of biotechnology.", "Three-quarters of all products in late-stage development come from smaller enterprises relying on venture capital as their principal source of funds.", "Roughly a third of new launches into the marketplace originate from independent biotech firms. The excitement about the innovations coming from the start-up community is real; evidence from the number of FDA novel drug approvals over the past few years indicate this is not a fluke.", "Frankly, as a veteran of R&D in the big established players, I think the start-up culture is hard to replicate.", "Big money and large-scale resources result in people getting too comfortable and losing their edge. It’s one reason why I think all these funding mega-rounds can be dangerous to the scrappy mindset of a start-up because it makes things too comfortable, too complacent.", "You lose the advantage over the people who are working on the same therapeutic target at Pfizer. Too much money and more time means you lose that focused hunger to succeed.", "Bigger still is what I call the sustainability factor that tends to afflict R&D in the biopharma top ten.", "Let’s consider if you are head of R&D in one of these companies five years ago. You’ve studied hard, consulted wide and conclude that the company needs to make a big investment in gene therapy – enough to be a leader in this emerging field.", "Then you stop and realize how many existing priority programs would have to give way to finance this new effort, especially when your board will default to the position that gene therapy investment must come from the existing budget.", "Does that mean you as R&D leader will have to find the funds by halting safety surveillance on a marketed product?", "Powerful internal forces will slow you down because it risks the work they’ve been pursuing for years.", "Building a gene therapy capability within the company becomes a no go. But consider if you took an alternative path and decided to march into the boardroom with a plan to acquire an emerging company – say Spark Therapeutics – along with its potentially transformative lead asset in gene therapy.", "In that scenario, you not only get the money from the balance sheet to purchase the company outright, you’ll also be given the P&L dollars to operate the new acquisition going forward.", "The incentives are aligned to buy the technology, not create it in-house. This is a fairly universal truth in big pharma.", "It’s a long way of explaining that making the transition from a major operational role in big pharma to the boutique VC space is logical because the momentum in innovation is now with smaller companies with a pressing need for financing.", "We are filling a major unmet need in the drug development ecosystem. I don’t see the dependence of big pharma on start-up innovators going away soon.", "IV: Any other learnings from making this transition?", "Harper: Well, the VC model is not perfect either. We now have some people in this field who are unscrupulous, or ignorant or both.", "They end up doing nasty things to entrepreneurs and the founders of start-ups. You also have a growing herd mentality, with money pouring into projects just because others are doing it; there is no detailed analysis or financial metrics, just seeing one high-profile VC doing a deal that others feel they should copy.", "One unhappy result of this is a growing lack of trust between VCs and the start-ups. Today, academics and young, inexperienced entrepreneurs assume that the VC people will take advantage if you don’t map a proper defense – the “only theparanoid survive” perspective.", "It may be a healthy response to a threat, but it makes it harder for me and my partner Beth because we have never operated in a manner that is any way exploitative.", "Reputation is critical to us; we are transparent operators and make sure our clients understand which kind of dilution they will experience over time as fund raising proceeds.", "No surprises that I appraise our co-investment VC partners as closely as the start-up.", "IV: What capabilities are needed to improve trust and raise the talent bar in VC work?", "Harper: There are too few people who combine science and technical know-how with leader behaviors and management savvy.", "It’s also important to understand the mechanics of finance and legal issues, which can be a steep learning curve for newcomers.", "Overall, however, it’s not rocket science. More important than the skill set is the great intangible called experience or intuition: namely, the right scientific package to bet on, and the people necessary to deliver on that bet.", "Such a background is most commonly found among people like me, with years of exposure to details on developing a drug for approval and marketing in a large, diversified organization like Amgen.", "Rarely do such people go into VC. Corporate life gives you structure and is mostly rewarding and comfortable; it is still possible to work till age 65 and then go on to perhaps become an advisor to a VC if not an actual investor.", "Experience can help to differentiate from the current VC situation here in southern California. We see people with no knowledge of the industry sitting on the boards of biotech start-ups, providing seed capital yet knowing little or nothing about drug development.", "They are flush with funds and looking for opportunities to put the money to work. Predictably, the process breaks down, financers get disillusioned and start withdrawing capital.", "Eventually, people like me enter the picture to reverse the decline by restructuring the pipeline, recapitalizing the operation and replacing the board.", "It can get very political. That makes a rescue operation hard work.", "Harper: The cycle begins when a new company obtains the initial series A funding, which is usually only enough to get it halfway to that critical inflection point of demonstrating to investors the value of the enterprise or asset(s).", "No one wants to give the company any more funds; it finds itself dead in the water. So even if we like the technology, we must go out there and convince the founders to restructure, and that often entails convincing them to accept a smaller stake in the enterprise, in return for us making it more valuable over time.", "It’s a hard sell. Very often we just have to walk away. This result is all too prevalent in the Los Angeles region due to the inadequate amounts of capital directed by people without the experience to understand how to succeed in biotech drug development.", "The amount of money being misdirected is really unsettling. It’s the same story – an angel investor who has a nephew with a disease wants to do well for the kid, so he invests in an unproven asset that may cure him yet in doing so actually blocks any hope of commercialization by replicating the blunders I just described.", "It’s like no good deed goes unpunished. I don’t see this in other sectors outside life sciences where the VC community keeps investing in assets or technologies it doesn’t understand.", "IV: Intuition – that feeling from the gut -- seems to be fundamental to your own investment value proposition.", "Harper: It is. But where does the intuition come from? It is experience stemming from pattern recognition; seeing hundreds of programs that have failed for any number or reasons.", "It’s like saying “I’ve seen this movie before and it doesn’t end well.”", "Schultz: You have spoken a lot about the importance of the product asset – the biologic compound or diagnostic.", "How much do you look at the composition and quality of the human capital – the team?", "Harper: This is hugely important. We can embrace multiple models of human capital after we determine the quality of the overall team is first rate.", "If it’s an experienced team, with a track record of doing something well in the past, and we know them and find them trustworthy, we will invest in them.", "Or we will invest on the word of a single CEO because of the trust factor. In both scenarios, they can go look for new technologies and be assured of our total support, at a level beyond the actual funding.", "Schultz: Which has the better chance: a great team and a bad drug, or a bad team and a great drug?", "Harper: Both scenarios are bad because, if you wish to succeed, neither one can trump the other. My view is great technology is the consequence of having the right people in place.", "Projects come and go, but if you don’t have a strong rooted culture of human capital those great results are difficult to sustain.", "Think of what happens when you pursue a technology at all costs and make the people expendable. Nothing very good.", "It follows as well that its critical to match the right people to roles in the organization. A talented person in the wrong post can be disastrous, especially in a team situation.", "A classic example is a chief science officer who excels in that position who aspires to the CEO title even though he has a reputation for endlessly pondering the evidence when making a decision.", "Clearly, if you install that person at the top there is going to be no end of pain. The genius is in convincing that CSO to stay and do what he or she does best.", "This is where a good VC partner adds value – delivering that prescient judgment call on people. Knowing many of them already, like Beth and I do, is an obvious help.", "IV: What will Westlake Village BioPartners look like a year from now?", "Harper: One year in, we are moving forward on a lot of fronts. Our plan is simple – keep building on our unique geographic business model to expand our portfolio of quality investments in great new science.", "You can expect to see an evolution toward a commercial presence in each of the five companies we have invested in to date.", "Of course, in some cases the technology will not work as planned so we will need to adapt and put in place a plan", "B. Nevertheless, we do not anticipate any of our companies failing outright. The technology may falter, the CEO may not work out, and people will have to be reassigned or replaced.", "But Beth and I have embraced a model that we think will make our investments successful in innovating to improve the state of care for patients.", "It’s so challenging to create these innovative start-ups in the first place that it’s folly not to be able to make that mid-course correction to plan B when plan A is demonstrably not working.", "We refuse to opt for the easy route of just injecting more money into the same approach. We adhere to that thesis 100%.", "I expect you will see continued maturation of our companies toward commercialization of their many promising assets.", "The performance metric is this: in this interview, we are talking about our VC, Westlake Village BioPartners.", "A year from now the conversation will be about our companies. We may be in stealth mode about our investments right now, but the time is coming when our companies will hold center stage.", "IV: Is a second funding round for Westlake expected soon?", "Harper: Not yet. We have raised an initial tranche of $320m, which gives us the resources to start 10 to 12 companies.", "We are gaining on that objective right now with our opportunities squarely focused on the Los Angeles environs, cementing Westlake Village BioPartner’s unique geography-centric business model.", "It’s enough to make us a catalyst in tagging Los Angeles as the newest global biotech ecosystem. As other VC start-ups follow, we do intend to initiate a second funding round of similar size, putting 10 to 15 more companies on the metro area map.", "IV: We are close to the start of a new decade for the biotech industry. US private venture-backed companies are on track this year to raise around $150bn.", "Is the VC market ready for a big correction? If so, how will this influence prospects for biotech start-ups and the options they have in going it alone as emerging growth companies?", "Harper: There will continue to be significant investments in biotechnology. We see a convergence of three factors that will be driving early-stage investments.", "First, the speed of technological progress is increasing in a non-linear fashion while costs are coming down, thanks to enablers like artificial intelligence and automation.", "Second, we are gaining new insights into understanding human biology that we never had before. Third, we have more tools to interdict disease pathways.", "We can now engineer more than a dozen different molecules or modalities to influence biological targets.", "So, our efforts in the lab are more precise and laser-focused. Regenerative cell therapies, nanoparticle delivery systems, gene-based therapies, viruses, CAR-T cells and nucleic acid are just some of the examples of new modalities that can overcome previously impenetrable barriers to treating disease."]}
