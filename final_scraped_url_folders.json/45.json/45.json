(DXCM -0.54%) is a medical device company that pioneered the development of continuous glucose monitors (CGM) used by diabetics to more accurately track their blood glucose levels and control their disease.", "Founded in 1999, DexCom competes against industry titans Medtronic (MDT 1.06%) and Abbott Labs (ABT -0.38%) in an addressable market that totals more than 30 million diabetics in the United States alone.", "Given there are 1.5 million new cases of diabetes diagnosed every year in America, and the number of people with diabetes is expected to eclipse 50 million by 2030, does DexCom deserve to be a top stock for growth investors to buy?", "When functioning normally, the pancreas releases insulin after we eat to convert glucose into stored energy.", "However, in patients with diabetes, the pancreas either doesn't produce any or enough insulin (type 1 diabetes) or the body has developed a resistance to the insulin it produces (type 2 diabetes).", "Resulting from genetic or environmental factors, type 1 diabetes is typically diagnosed in childhood or in adolescence.", "A lifelong disease, type 1 diabetes requires chronic blood glucose monitoring and regular insulin dosing to prevent the buildup of blood sugar that can lead to a series of health problems.", "Type 2 diabetes is usually diagnosed later in life than type 1 and while the cause of type 2 diabetes isn't fully understood, a person's genetics and lifestyle are considered contributing factors to developing insulin resistance.", "The most common type of diabetes, type 2 diabetes accounts for about 95% of diabetes patients. While type 2 patients don't have as intensive of a regimen for monitoring their blood sugar, these patients often progress to requiring insulin and ongoing analysis of blood sugar levels is critical.", "Absent adequate monitoring and the correct use of insulin, diabetes patients are at risk of developing a variety of health problems, including nerve damage that can lead to amputation, vision loss that can lead to blindness, and life-threatening kidney disease and cardiovascular disease.", "According to the World Health Organization (WHO), adults with diabetes have a two- to threefold higher risk of heart attack and stroke than their nondiabetic peers.", "Diabetes is the seventh leading cause of death and overall, the average life expectancy of someone with diabetes at age 50 is reduced by nearly nine years.", "There are 30.3 million Americans living with diabetes in America, according to the Centers for Disease Control (CDC), and globally, the addressable patient population eclipses 422 million, up from 108 million in 1980, according to WHO.", "The number of people with diabetes is expected to increase substantially over the coming decade, and as a result, the total costs associated with treating it is forecast to skyrocket.", "Research from the Institute for Alternative Futures (IAF) concludes that the number of people with diagnosed or undiagnosed diabetes in the U.S. will reach 54.9 million by 2030 and that spending on diabetes will increase to $622 billion in 2030 from $408 billion in 2015.", "Medications, including metformin, are widely used to help keep blood glucose levels from causing life-threatening problems in type 2 patients, but the most critical component of keeping diabetes in check for type 1 patients is accurate monitoring and insulin dosing to avoid dangerously high (hyperglycemia) or low (hypoglycemia) levels of blood sugar.", "Usually, type 1 and type 2 diabetes patients evaluate their blood sugar levels by using finger sticks to collect a small blood sample that can be analyzed by a glucose meter.", "Because type 1 diabetics produce very little or no insulin, they undergo this routine four to 10 times per day, including prior to eating, before and after exercising, and before falling asleep.", "Regular checks of blood sugar during the night aren't uncommon, either. Type 2 diabetics don't require as intensive of monitoring but they still check their blood sugar levels often, including around mealtimes.", "Despite regularly checking blood sugar with finger sticks, studies show most diabetes patients spend 70% of every day outside of the healthy range for blood sugar, and as a result, are at a greater risk of diabetes causing life-threatening problems.", "Recognizing that finger sticks and glucose metering fall short for many people, DexCom was founded in 1999 with a singular mission: to develop medical devices that continuously monitor blood glucose levels so that patients can better determine when they should be taking their insulin.", "Until 2003, DexCom's research focused primarily on developing implantable sensors that could remain in the body for an extended time.", "But in 2004, growing concern that the company would face challenges gaining approval for a long-term implant solution that was more invasive and costly than traditional finger sticks, led to the development of short-term, temporary sensors that can be attached to the skin.", "In 2005, DexCom raised $56.4 million in an IPO on the Nasdaq to fund clinical trials of its short- and long-term system.", "The short-term sensor and CGM solution -- the STS continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) system -- won FDA approval in 2006 after trials demonstrated patients spent less time outside a normal healthy blood sugar range while using it.", "The long-term implant solution, however, was halted after the company \"evaluated several months of data from feasibility studies\" and determined the product \"didn't warrant investing in a large pivotal trial.\"", "In short, creating a reliable long-term device that would pass muster with regulators, payers, and patients was too difficult a challenge to overcome, particularly given the successful launch of the short-term sensor solution, which was a revolutionary advance in its own right.", "The short-term STS system used tiny wire-like sensors that were inserted by the patient just under the skin that could be worn for three days.", "Data collected by these sensors was reported wirelessly to the STS receiver, where it was charted and displayed in a graph to patients.", "To help patients know when their blood glucose levels were too high or too low, the STS system also included a feature that triggered alerts.", "The company's second-generation product, the seven-day STS CGM system, got the FDA's nod in 2007. That system increased the time sensors could be worn by diabetics from three to seven days and it included a feature that allowed patients to download their glucose level data to a computer for review.", "These early systems provided revolutionary insight to patients but didn't begin to gain widespread adoption until 2008, when results from a Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation trial were unveiled.", "In its 322-person trial, CGMs significantly improved glucose control without hypoglycemia. The study was important because it reduced worry that the use of CGM's could cause patients to take too much insulin.", "Thanks in part to a growing body of evidence supporting the use of CGMs, DexCom's sales began to accelerate.", "In 2008, sales climbed 76% to $8.1 million and by 2011, sales were topping $40 million. The rapid run-up in sales allowed DexCom to plow more money into research and development, and that spending led to the development of its next generation of CGMs, the G-series.", "The company's first G-series CGM was the G4 Platinum, which won FDA approval in 2012. The G4 was smaller than the STS systems preceding it, and it improved hypoglycemic accuracy by 30%.", "The improvement in accuracy is important because CGM's don't measure glucose levels through the bloodstream.", "Instead, they do so through the interstitium, a fluid-filled space just under the skin. Because CGM sensors are inserted into the interstitium, the CGM's software contains code that deduces actual blood sugar levels from the sensor readings at points in time.", "Absent greater accuracy, patients were still at risk of taking too much insulin, which can cause hypoglycemia.", "The G4 also offered a longer transmission range between its sensors and the receiver and a more user-friendly color LCD display than previous devices.", "In 2015, DexCom followed up the G4 with the G5. The G5 allowed patients to see real-time data on either a DexCom receiver or on any compatible device, including smartphones, via an app.", "The G5 also included an option to securely share real-time data with a caregiver, such as a parent, and it provided access to a cloud-based repository where data could be stored for review.", "Importantly, the G5 was the first DexCom CGM to do away with the need to confirm CGM readings with finger sticks prior to taking insulin.", "Although finger sticks were still necessary every 12 hours to calibrate the system, the advance significantly reduced the burden of finger sticks on patients.", "Ongoing technological advances, such as the G4 and G5, alongside growing acceptance of CGMs generally, has been a boon to the company's top line.", "Since 2008, DexCom's annual sales have increased from less than $10 million to $718.5 million in 2017 -- a compounded annual growth of nearly 57%.", "DexCom isn't the only company profiting from continuous glucose monitoring systems.", "Medtronic and Abbott Labs are deep-pocketed foes and each has recently launched compelling new devices for diabetes that challenge DexCom.", "After securing an unexpected early approval in 2016, Medtronic launched its MiniMed 670G in 2017. The MiniMed 670G is the world's first closed-loop monitoring and insulin dosing system to win the regulatory green light.", "It combines Medtronic's Guardian CGM and Medtronic's insulin pump in a system that automatically measures blood glucose levels every five minutes and then, automatically doses insulin when it's necessary.", "The MiniMed 670G marks a major advance in treating diabetics requiring extensive monitoring and so far, it's a hit.", "In Medtronic's 2018 fiscal fourth quarter, diabetes revenue rose 26% to $645 million because of the system.", "Abbott Labs is also riding a wave of growing demand following the approval of its latest CGM, the Freestyle Libre.", "When the Freestyle Libre won FDA approval in 2017, it became the first CGM approved that didn't require daily finger sticks for calibration.", "The device's sensors do have a 12-hour warm-up period in which data isn't recorded, however, so finger sticks are necessary during that period.", "The Freestyle Libre launched at a lower price point than DexCom's G5 and since it eliminated the need for finger sticks for calibration, it's become a commercial success.", "As of March 2018, 650,000 patients were using the Freestyle Libre and 50,000 new patients were being added monthly.", "Abbott hasn't said specifically how much money the Freestyle Libre's contributing to its top-line, but it has said that it was responsible for a 30% increase in its diabetes revenue in Q1 2018.", "Abbott Labs reports its diabetes sales in its \"other\" category and in Q1 2018, \"other\" revenue accounted for $430 million of Abbott Labs $7.4 billion in total sales.", "As you can see in the following chart, the 2017 approval of Abbott's Freestyle Libre took a toll on DexCom's share price.", "However, the sell-off proved temporary as the company's shares rallied sharply following the FDA approval of DexCom's latest CGM, the G6, in March 2018.", "The G6 is arguably more feature-rich than the Freestyle Libre. Like the Freestyle Libre, DexCom's G6 eliminates the need for finger sticks, but unlike Abbott Labs' CGM, the G6's sensors only have a two-hour warm-up period.", "The G6 automatically communicates data between its sensors and a receiver and the receiver can be a smartphone or similar device, too.", "Alternatively, Abbott's receiver has to be held within 1.5 inches of its sensors to transfer data and there's no app yet that allows patients to use a smartphone or tablet as the receiver.", "Furthermore, the G6 warns patients of dangerous glucose readings with an alarm, while the Freestyle Libre doesn't.", "The G6 system uses smaller sensors than DexCom's G5 and its sensors can be applied to the skin with a new one-touch applicator that's easier to use.", "Additionally, the G6's sensors can be worn for 10 days while the G5 sensors are only approved for seven days of use.", "G6's features could help DexCom outcompete the Freestyle Libre, but what's most exciting about the G6 is that it's the first CGM to win FDA approval as a stand-alone system or as a CGM for use in automated insulin dosing systems.", "Currently, Medtronic is the only company marketing a closed-loop monitoring and insulin dosing system (the aforementioned MiniMed 670G), but insulin pump makers Insulet (PODD 1.08%) and Tandem Diabetes (TNDM -6.34%) are working on their own closed-loop systems and those systems are being designed for use with DexCom's CGMs.", "Studies for a system that pairs up the G5 with Insulet's Omnipod insulin pump are underway, and according to management, its closed-loop system could reach the market as soon as late 2019.", "Meanwhile, Tandem Diabetes is even closer to the finish line. Its t:slim X2 insulin pump is the only pump approved for use with DexCom's G5 that doesn't require finger sticks prior to dosing insulin, and Tandem says an FDA approval of a closed-loop system using the G5 could come as soon as the summer of 2018.", "An OK for a system that incorporates the G6 could be available by the end of 2018 or early 2019, too.", "The potential associated with DexCom's G6 isn't limited to those two solutions, though. DexCom is looking at pairing it up with other solutions, such as smart insulin pens or apps, too.", "DexCom's innovation isn't going to stop with the G6, either. The company's working closely with Alphabet (GOOG 1.62%) (GOOGL 1.60%)", "healthcare spinoff Verily on disposable CGM solutions that could find their way to the market in 2020.", "DexCom is at the forefront of CGM technology and its strategy of working with any insulin delivery system could help it win more market share over time.", "The company isn't profitable yet, though, and there's no guarantee its sales will reach the levels necessary to produce consistent earnings.", "Nevertheless, the sheer size of the addressable market for diabetes medical devices and a single-digit penetration rate for CGMs in that market suggest there's plenty of potential for revenue to climb high enough for DexCom to eventually reward shareholders with profits.", "Undeniably, DexCom's got heavyweight competition from Medtronic and Abbott Labs, but unlike those companies, it's a pure player in this market.", "If CGMs become a standard used alongside insulin delivery to treat diabetes patients, then its investors could benefit substantially."]}

undisputed champion of soft tissue robotic surgery ever since.", "While competitors have threatened, there has not been a substantial challenge made to the da Vinci’s reign.", "Both Medtronic and Johnson & Johnson have promised to put their own solution onto the market, but after two and a half decades of dominance, Intuitive has built up quite the buffer as it awaits those competitors.", "While others cross the Ts and dot the Is on their own systems, Intuitive moves forward with installations, which continues to grow its market dominance.", "To that end, in 2023, there was a 22% increase in surgical procedures performed with the da Vinci system compared to 2022.", "The growth was across several of the various specialties for which the robotic solution is indicated—general, urologic, gynecologic, and biopsy procedures.", "This increase was experienced both within the U.S. and outside the U.S. Regarding actual placements of the da Vinci system, the number grew to 1,370 in 2023 from the 2022 total of 1,264.", "In addition to gaining ongoing buy-in from the healthcare industry, Intuitive also notched several product wins during its 2023 fiscal.", "Most notable was the U.S. FDA clearance in April of the da Vinci SP for simple prostatectomy, a surgical procedure often used in patients with benign prostatic hyperplasia or enlarged prostate.", "In this procedure, the surgeon removes the part of an enlarged prostate that is blocking the flow of urine.", "In the same action, the FDA cleared the da Vinci SP surgical system for a transvesical approach to simple and

accessories revenue.", "The business tallied $4.28 billion during the year.", "On the other hand, Systems was flat with $1.68 billion primarily due to higher operating lease revenue in contrast to lower sales-type lease revenue and more placements as the result of operating leases.", "The 14% increase for Services, for which a larger installed base of systems producing service revenue was credited, ultimately materialized into $1.17 billion in revenue for the organization.", "Given the success Intuitive continued to experience, it was determined changes should take place at the top.",

For instance, a small Mayo Clinic study found that cardiac rehabilitation patients who used a health app lost more weight following a heart attack than those who went through cardiac rehabilitation without one.", "Finally, at HIMSS16 in Las Vegas, Dr. Ashish Atreja, director of the AppLab at Mount Sinai hospital, announced the launch of a new data sharing initiative meant to improve the situation around digital health efficacy data.", "Atreja described it as a \"clinicaltrials.gov for digital health pilots\", where hospitals will share as much as they can about what they're working on in single site studies, in order to avoid duplication.", "Another trend that continued into the quarter was hospitals launching more, and more involved, patient apps.", "For instance, in January the New York-Presbyterian Hospital announced the launch of a new app, called NewYork-Presbyterian, that is designed to improve a patient’s access to the hospital as well as communication between the hospital and patients.", "The New York-Presbyterian app currently allows users to locate a physician, find contact information for appointment scheduling and questions, get directions to the hospital, pay bills, and connect with the hospital on Twitter.", "But over time, the hospital plans to add many more features.", "Ochsner Health System in Louisiana introduced a new program called Optimal Hospital that encompasses a number of different apps and devices to “improve workflow efficiencies in managing patient care, initiating more frequent and dynamic patient interaction,” according to the health system.", "Several aspects of the program are Epic apps, like the Haiku app for iPhone and Apple Watch, the Canto app on iPad, Epic Rover on iPhone, and the MyChart Bedside app.", "They’re also using the Sotera Wireless ViSi Mobile System to monitor patients.", "Some hospitals also announced pilots of apps for specific conditions. The NYU Langone Medical Center’s Rusk Rehabilitation facility is embarking on a new clinical trial testing the effect of a mobile app on cardiac rehabilitation beyond three months.", "The 100-patient trial will test the MOVN app from Marina Del Rey, California-based Moving Analytics. Massachusetts General Hospital and behavioral health startup Cogito have partnered on a National Institute of Mental Health-funded project aimed at addressing depression and bipolar disorder.", "And UCSF Diabetes Center has announced a partnership with mobile-enabled health coaching company Yes Health to use the company's app user data for research.", "But even as more hospitals launched apps, some studies suggested those apps weren’t seeing widespread adoption.", "Although 66 percent of the largest 100 US hospitals have consumer-facing mobile apps, and 38 percent of those have developed proprietary apps for their patients, a mere 2 percent of patients at those 66 hospitals are using apps provided to them, according to an Accenture report that came out in January.", "Another report, from the Commonwealth Fund, found that just 43 percent of iOS health apps and 27 percent of Android health apps were useful, based on an assessment of the iTunes descriptions of 945 iOS and Android health apps.", "There was some talk about patient portals and personal health records this quarter, and how patients could best interact with their data.", "Drs. Isaac Kohane and Kenneth Mandl of the Harvard-affiliated Boston Children's Hospital, published an editorial in the New England Journal of Medicine suggesting that now might finally be the time for personal health records to gain traction.", "On the other hand, a group of researchers from Johns Hopkins, the Ohio State University, and the National Cancer Institute argued in favor of continued patient portal adoption, issuing a widely panned prediction that, based on projections from NCI survey data, 75 percent of US adults will use personal health records (PHRs) by 2020, even without additional interventions.", "Read on for Q1 2016 digital health news about payers, pharma, funding, and M&A."]}

Several metrics can be computed over these differences, such as %20/20-ISO boundaries, absolute relative difference, and mean absolute relative difference (MARD)", "[10].

[61] proposed a DSS with automated insulin titration and dosing, proving that the use of the system results in reduced glucose variability and improved protection against hypoglycemia.", "Moreover, DreaMed (DreaMed Diabetes Ltd., Petah Tikva, Israel) recently introduced the Advisor Pro, a responsive application that provides real-time automated analysis of patient specific behavior to come up with personalized estimates of the optimal insulin treatment plan [62], which received FDA approval to be marketed in the United States in 2018 [63].", "Finally, Patient Empowerment through Predictive PERsonalised decision support (PEPPER), a project funded by the European Community under the Horizon 2020 research program, has recently entered its final test phase, after several preliminary studies showed that it is able to improve glucose control and reducing the incidence of hypoglycemic episodes [64].", "Since 2006, medical devices integrating CGM sensors and insulin pumps have become commercially available, the Medtronic MiniMed Paradigm REAL-time system being the first device allowing such integration.", "Later in 2009, Medtronic integrated systems have been equipped with the low glucose suspend (or threshold suspend) feature that allows to automatically suspend basal insulin infusion for up to 2 hours when CGM measurements fall below a user-defined low glucose threshold.", "This feature, implemented in the Medtronic Paradigm Veo and MiniMed 530G, was designed to mitigate hypoglycemic events in insulin pump therapy [65].", "Most recent Medtronic systems, i.e., the MiniMed 640G and 630G, implement the SmartGuard feature, which also allows to suspend basal insulin infusion when CGM measurements are predicted to fall below a preset threshold in the next 30 minutes (prediction low glucose management)", "Basal insulin suspension algorithms have been intensively studied also by academic research groups. In particular, the group led by Dr. Bruce Buckingham have been very active in this research line since 2009, by testing several prediction algorithms and insulin suspension criteria in both inpatient and outpatient clinical trials.", "Their final algorithm performs 30-minute ahead glucose prediction by a Kalman filter and suspends basal insulin when the predicted glucose concentration fall below 80 mg/dL", "[67]. Basal insulin delivery is restarted as soon as CGM measurements start rising or after 2 consecutive hours of suspension.", "The algorithms developed by Buckingham et al. [67], as well as those implemented in commercial devices, can only turn on or off basal insulin delivery.", "A different approach was adopted by the group led by Prof. Kovatchev at the University of Virginia, who proposed algorithms to attenuate, rather than suspend, basal insulin delivery in presence of hypoglycemia risk.", "Specifically, their “power brakes” algorithm performs 15-minute ahead glucose prediction using physiological model-based Kalman filtering and applies a BG risk function in order to calculate a basal insulin attenuation factor depending on predicted risk of hypoglycemia [68].", "Several clinical trials were performed to assess the safety and effectiveness of basal insulin suspension algorithms both in clinic under controlled conditions [69,70,71,72] and at home under real-life conditions [67,73,74,75].", "Evidences from these trials supported the effectiveness of these algorithms in reducing hypoglycemia, at the expenses of a slight increase in hyperglycemia.", "Nevertheless, the use of basal insulin suspension was not associated with a significant increase of HbA1c or occurrence of ketoacidosis.", "For an exhaustive review of algorithms for basal insulin suspension/attenuation, their implementation in commercial devices and clinical evidence of their effectiveness and safety, we refer the reader to [76].", "Automatic CGM-based basal insulin suspension/attenuation represents the first step towards closed-loop systems, namely AP, in which a control algorithm automatically tune insulin pump injections based on CGM readings.", "Research on closed-loop systems has been very intense in the last 10 years [77,78,79]. Several control algorithms were proposed and assessed in clinical trials, including proportional-integral-derivative controller [80,81], model predictive control", "[82], and fuzzy logic controller [83]. Most of closed-loop systems adopt the hybrid approach, in which insulin boluses are manually administered by the user (meal amount required for meal bolus computation), while basal insulin rate is automatically tuned by the control algorithm.", "Recently, a hybrid closed-loop system has entered the market, as in 2017 Medtronic launched the MiniMed 670G, i.e., the first commercially available hybrid closed-loop system.", "A retrospective analysis of 3-month real-world glucose data has shown improved clinical outcomes in patients using the Auto Mode of the MiniMed 670G, compared to patients on Manual Mode [84].", "Fully closed-loop systems that do not require patients to announce meals to the controller are also under development, though an increased risk for hypoglycemia has been reported in T1DM individuals with fully closed-loop control compared to hybrid closed-loop control [85].", "A fully-closed loop system has been recently tested in adult inpatients with T2DM receiving non-critical care [86,87].", "Results demonstrated that the closed-loop insulin delivery can greatly improve the time spent in the target range (difference between closed-loop and control groups of up to 32% points) without increasing hypoglycemia.", "A recent pilot study suggested that hybrid AP can be beneficial also for non-hospitalized MDI-treated T2DM subjects [88], although further investigation is needed to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of AP in this population.", "While research in AP is progressively increasing the safety and effectiveness of such devices, also exploring bi-hormonal systems allowing controlled delivery of both insulin and glucagon [89], patients have shown an increased interest for the AP technology.", "This gave rise to the OpenAPS community, a community of patients highly interested in directly improving diabetes technologies, who have designed their own open source AP system, also called do-it-yourself closed-loop system.", "Although no clinical trial has ever assessed the safety and effectiveness of such open source systems, OpenAPS users self-reported an improvement in HbA1c, time in range, glycemic variability and quality of life, while perceiving the OpenAPS system as safe [90,91].", "For an exhaustive review of algorithms for closed-loop control and AP technologies, we refer the reader to recent reviews [77,78,79].", "The advent of CGM sensors has revolutionized the glucose monitoring in T1DM. The recent approval of CGM therapeutic use and the new reimbursement policies have contributed to increase the number of CGM users worldwide, which is expected to further rise in the next years when less obtrusive and cheaper sensors will become available.", "Indeed, major CGM companies, like Dexcom and Medtronic, have announced the development of new products designed to be smaller and less expensive than current state-of-the-art systems, which can target not only T1DM patients, but also the much larger market of people with T2DM", "[22,92]. Furthermore, emerging companies are working on low-cost non-invasive CGM systems [93,94], which may even bring CGM technology to the consumer market.", "Important advances are expected also in terms of CGM interoperability with other devices, e.g., medical devices for diabetes therapy, activity trackers and other physiological wearable sensors.", "Indeed, the FDA has recently defined a new class of CGM devices, i.e., integrated continuous glucose monitoring (iCGM) systems, including devices to be used as part of an integrated system with other compatible medical devices and electronic interfaces.", "This will enable iCGM developers to bring their device to the market more rapidly. The first CGM sensor to receive FDA approval with the iCGM label is the Dexcom G6 device, launched in 2018", "[95]. The integration of CGM data with data of insulin pump and other wearable sensors, like activity trackers, will allow improving algorithms for glucose prediction and automatic basal insulin modulation, as recent studies with basal insulin suspension [96] and AP during exercise [97] have suggested.", "CGM data integrated with other diabetes management data (e.g., insulin pumps, SMBG and mHealth apps data) and activity data will also allow to enhance diabetes DSSs, enabling a better understanding of the causes driving to abnormal glucose events and, finally, a better tailoring of diabetes therapy to the patient's lifestyle and habits.", "Finally as more broadly discussed in [9], CGM data could be integrated with other clinical data sources, including clinical registries, electronic health records, prescription registries and biomarkers collected in laboratory tests, which will provide important clinical contextualization to CGM data.", "This will allow the generation of a digital ecosystem of diabetes data that could be exploited to extract novel insights on the mechanisms of diabetes progression and develop cutting-edge data analytics for personalized diabetes management and prevention of related complications.", "CONFLICTS OF INTEREST: No potential conflict of interest relevant to this article was reported.", "- 1.Wang J.

The company doesn’t just want to produce incrementally “good” products; they strive for remarkable.", "They want awesome. And their recipe for success is a relentless focus on providing solutions for the specific problems faced by diabetics.", "Interestingly, they combine this narrow focus on diabetics with a broad view on the myriad technologies that may be required to provide innovative solutions to their problems.", "Dexcom seems to have found a way to get the innovation payoffs of narrow focus and deep customer expertise, while avoiding the incremental improvement mindset that often comes with those strengths.", "Having a tight focus on the problems you are trying to solve, Sayer emphasizes, is critical for an entrepreneurial company in his sector.", "If you hope to achieve anything unprecedented in a field as well established and researched as health management, you must deeply understand the problem and be well versed in prior art.", "Engineers at Dexcom invest a lot of time in staying current on the relevant science and technology. When such deep knowledge is required to innovate, a company has to wisely choose its focal point.", "“We haven't tried to make a whole bunch of different products and attack a whole bunch of different industries,” Sayer says.", "“We've known what problem we've wanted to solve, and really designed technology to do that.”", "Highly focused firms like Dexcom are also well positioned to gain deep familiarity with their customers – always an advantage for innovators.", "“We probably have the most patient-focused culture of a medical device company I've ever been around,” says Sayer.", "“Our team spends a tremendous amount of time with physicians and patients out in the field.” And Dexcom’s commitment to understanding patients’ perspectives goes much deeper than conversation.", "“We're all human pincushions,” he says, who are willing to “wear glucose sensor technology to experience what the customers experience.”", "(He quickly assures us that no one is defying FDA regulations by doing so.)", "See the full list of Most Innovative Growth Companies for 2017 here.", "Even though Dexcom pays attention to a narrow range of customer problems, it develops deep expertise in a broad set of technologies to generate innovative solutions.", "The company relies on people with very different expertise to collaborate on different aspects of a product simultaneously.", "According to Sayer, this is the most innovative aspect of Dexcom’s approach. “Developing a continuous glucose monitoring solution requires ingenuity on many fronts.", "Anything that ends with ‘engineer,’ we have,” Sayer says. “We have chemical engineers, electrical engineers, mechanical engineers, software engineers, human factors engineers …” and as these various experts make progress at different paces, “one generation or one innovation might focus on the software and the algorithm … and other times, we'll go through the chemistry side, and the membranes on the sensor.”", "Applying deep expertise in a wide variety of technologies by different groups allows Dexcom to rapidly iterate toward better solutions.", "And the company doesn’t shy away from innovating at any time during the product life cycle. As an example, Sayer cites the latest generation G5 mobile system which came about when “our algorithm guys said, ‘Hey, we have better software,’” and their innovation was quickly integrated, “making it much more accurate than anything else without changing the rest of the system.”", "While Dexcom has built deep expertise in a wide mixture of technologies, it still partners with outside firms to broaden the set of technologies even further.", "For example, Verily Life Sciences, a subsidiary of Google parent company Alphabet, is a key partner. Sayer reports that, from an innovation standpoint, the collaboration with Verily “has really been a good thing for us ….", "We weren't used to a Verily-type pace, and the way Verily people look at projects is different than traditional medical device people.”", "For example, “when they're done with something, they want to launch it tomorrow,” says Sayer. Another difference is that they tend to think big, really big.", "Verily’s criterion for starting a project, he says, is that it should have the potential to produce an offering that is “ten times better than what's already on the market.”", "To do that, you have to shoot for remarkable. The focus on producing something new that is order of magnitudes better than what’s on the market pushes Dexcom to use every technology possible to produce a breakthrough.", "Although many factors contribute to Dexcom’s innovative prowess, this interplay between focusing tightly on a narrow set of customer problems, while drawing widely on a variety of technologies, is a critical component.", "This combination helps Dexcom generate innovations that leap beyond incremental improvements to established methods.", "Sayer explains. “It's very comfortable to do marginal improvements, and just keep doing marginal improvements, and not take any risks.”", "Every young company’s journey to the Forbes Most Innovative Growth Companies list is different. But if these businesses have one thing in common, it might be this: that they have found a way to resolve some fundamental tension that holds innovation back in other settings.", "Dexcom’s version of this is its ability to maintain an obsessive focus on the problem it was founded to solve, while fighting off the insularity and incrementalism that so often go along with that by exploring broadly with technologies that might solve that problem.", "It’s not easy for an enterprise to stay focused when there are tempting opportunities all around — and it’s not easy for people to think big when they’re in a sector more disposed to think small.", "But if an organization can do both these things, then it has a real advantage. And maybe it’s even fair to expect all its teams’ innovations to be remarkable."]}

He declined to even name the competition despite repeated questions about the competitive landscape where DexCom with its G6 device and Abbott with its FreeStyle Libre play in.", "Medtronic estimates the CGM sensor market to be worth $1 billion and expects it to grow to $2 billion though there are other reports that describe a much bigger market.", "While it is not clear how many patients are using the Guardian Connect CGM device either with a Medtronic insulin pump or without, it is worthwhile to consider what caused this change of corporate heart to return to a standalone CGM.", "First, Ishrak has made no secret of his desire to expand the company’s reach into the much larger, type 2 diabetes market – more specifically those multiple daily injections.", "Combine that with the company’s desire to become a diabetes management player instead of a diabetes widget maker explains another rationale behind opening up to both type 1 and type 2 diabetes patients who may want to get off of blood glucose meters to a continuous glucose monitoring device.", "And finally, there is the broader trend of consumerization of health where patients are demanding ease of use and convenience from even their medical devices.", "The Guardian Connect CGM device, for instance, eliminates the typical CGM receiver device completely, preferring instead to route readings from the bodyworn sensor directly to a user’s smartphone.", "This is apparently the only CGM device currently approved that actually requires a smartphone to transmit readings.", "Here’s how Todd Robin, vice president of Connected Care, Medtronic Diabetes explained the move to the standalone CGM market in a recent phone interview:", "As we spent time in the diabetes community, we recognized that not all people with diabetes are ready or willing to go on a pump", "and so it was really important to us, as we try to be a holistic diabetes management company, that we offered a fuller set of solutions.", "And So Guardian Connect became important for the strategy there. In parallel, consumer technology has evolved so rapidly in the last five to 10 years that as we better understood customer needs, we recognized that we had a unique opportunity to bring a smarter CGM solution to market to lessen the burden of diabetes management for the community that we serve.", "And one example of the ways we do that is eliminating the need for a separate receiver so that an individual can get their glucose values directly from their sensor and transmitter to their smartphone.", "There’s also additional reasons for Medtronic’s return to CGM market. There is a growing body of evidence that shows that CGM devices help a person suffering from diabetes to exert better glycemic control and improve their diabetes management.", "Indeed Medtronic itself presented data at the American Diabetes Association’s annual meeting that showed patients using the companion app that comes with the Guardian Connect device showing more time in their healthy glucose range.", "[Medtronic studied 256 patients using the Sugar. IQ companion app and found that daily they spent 36 more minutes in their individual healthy glucose range than they did before using the app.", "This included 30 minutes less time in hyperglycemia (>180 mg/dL) and 6 minutes less time in hypoglycemia (<70 mg/dL).", "All this translates to more than 9 additional days in a year that a person with diabetes is spending in a healthy glucose range.]", "Aside from CGM showing better diabetes management and overall clinical validation, another reason prompting return to the standalone CGM market could be because the regular insulin pump business has changed for the worse.", "“Insulin pumps are not really a lucrative market anymore – in 2017, Roche discontinued insulin pumps, Animas (J&J) followed suit.", "We are left with new generation companies (Tandem Diabetes and the like), that are more focused on ‘artificial pancreas’ type products,” wrote Siddharth Shah, an analyst with Frost & Sullivan who follows the diabetes market, in an email response to questions.", "“In this environment, I think it makes sense to make money from the standalone CGM market — where Abbott and Dexcom are still doing pretty well overall.", "So a smart strategy in that sense for sure, with Medtronic having existing and good sensors (for pumps)” that can be applied to CGMs.", "Shah also pointed to features that Medtronic’s Guardian Connect CGM has that no other CGM device has: “predictions for 10-60 minutes and also Sugar.", "IQ AI support – no one else still has that support.”", "That is a reference to the predictive analytics that’s part of the Sugar. IQ app referenced above in the data presented to ADA.", "Medtronic developed the app with IBM using machine learning and AI to gather insulin pump data and bette predict blood glucose highs and lows.", "It’s a feature that Robin of Medtronic also highlighted.", "“One of the pieces of customer feedback that we get on Guardian Connect is that people managing their diabetes want more than just a number — that is their blood glucose levels.", "They like the predictive alerts where they get advance warning in terms of when they might get a high or a low,” he said.", "“They also just want personalized insights that they can act on. So with Guardian Connect, plus the companion app, Sugar.", "IQ, we believe we have a really smart CGM system that can add significant benefit patients.”", "Dexcom’s G6 may not have personalized insights per se, but it does have predictive alerts to help avoid low blood sugar events, which can be lethal.", "On the other hand, both the G6 and the Libre from Abbott possess a quality that Medtronic’s Guardian Connect doesn’t: FDA indication for therapeutic dosing.", "And this means that Medtronic’s device cannot be used to make treatment decisions and fingersticks – which are no longer necessary with Dexcom’s G6 — is still required with the Guardian Connect system.", "“The therapeutic CGM means that patients can make treatment decisions based upon their Dexcom CGM readings – no more fingersticks!,” wrote Rick Doubleday, Dexcom’s chief commercial officer, in an email response to questions forwarded by a company representative.", "Also of note is that lacking that ability for therapeutic dosing, Medtronic’s device is not covered by CMS — Dexcom’s G5 is covered by Medicare as is Abbott’s device.", "Shah, the Frost analyst, said the therapeutic dosing is a big difference between Medtronic’s Guardian Connect CGM and competing CGMs but only as it relates to those using multiple daily insulin injections, the market Medtronic wants to target.", "“Yes, definitely the other two are better, but for standalone, MDI users. There are insulin pump users who use Dexcom sensors with other non-Medtronic pumps too, where insulin dosing indications are irrelevant.”", "Shah speculated whether Medtronic’s plan to not add the technology for a therapeutic claim was spurred by the desire to still get diabetes patients on to their insulin pumps.", "“… this is a chosen strategy I feel by Medtronic, still pushing the agenda on insulin pumps, and later on the artificial pancreas [the MiniMed 670G].", "I may be wrong on this, [but] not entirely sure why they didn’t go for insulin dosing – they definitely have the tech and know-how.”", "Medtronic’s Robin however declared that adding this insulin dosing capability would have required a longer regulatory cycle and Medtronic wanted to bring the Guardian Connect CGM sooner to the market.", "The company is apparently working on a CGM device with a therapeutic dosing indication but Robin declined to provide a timeframe for when it will become available.", "Meanwhile the company, in the near future for, plans to ask Medicare to reimburse the bodyworn Guardian Connect sensor under a non-adjunctive labeling, which means reimbursement without that dosing claim.", "Overall, it appears that Medtronic’s return to the standalone CGM market will not be a major headache for its competitors.", "Despite Ishrak’s “taking share” declaration in the earnings call, Shah said the CGM market is large enough to accommodate more than one player.", "[Indeed Medtronic’s own analysis puts CGM penetration at around 20 percent by people using multiple daily injections.]", "Doubleday of Dexcom flat out rejected the notion that Medtronic’s Guardian Connect has taken market share, instead focusing the fact that Medtronic will now be pushing for better reimbursement too.", "“We have no evidence of market erosion from the launch of the MDT standalone,” he wrote. “But I think it’s safe to say that competition is raising the awareness of CGM and growing the market overall.", "You’ve got not just us, but now others out there educating the value of CGM.”", "And that is exactly where the rubber meets the road. The issue of reimbursement is paramount given that some of these devices are quite expensive for patients – in the several thousand range, per Shah.", "“Any MDI (multiple daily injections) diabetic would probably like to get an insulin pump to avoid daily injections (unless they have concerns around having something on their body all the time, in which case they may not choose a CGM either) – but they cannot due to lack of reimbursement,” Shah said.", "“We continue to view CGM devices as only for T1 and insulin dependent T2 users.”", "Meanwhile for patients who don’t have uncontrolled diabetes, Shah thinks Abbott’s cheaper FreeStyle Libre system might be better suited.", "Flash glucose monitoring is considered to be a replacement for the painful fingersticks and while not aconnected to the receiver device is considered a CGM.", "Going back to Medtronic, irrespective of whether it wins dominance in the CGM market or loses, the ultimate winner is likely diabetes patients who more have more options than ever before."]}

more recently, however, leading medtech firms have been changing the way they approach innovation and the types of solutions they are focused on.", "In particular, many players are increasingly relying on M&A deals to enable outsourced and networked models for device development.", "Under such models, companies are reducing the proportion of their investments that is dedicated to in-house R&D, instead favoring mergers and acquisitions, joint ventures, co-development partnerships, capital-only funding investments, or innovation hub sponsorships to incorporate novel products into their portfolios.", "Relative to in-house R&D, networked innovation models can be more cost-effective, lower-risk, and can lead to more effective and relevant product developments due to the collaboration of various industry stakeholders.", "In addition, these models are increasingly involving non-traditional industry partners such as technology companies, which have been enthusiastically working with medical device companies to bring innovations to the fields of health app development, telemedicine, AI, robotics, 3-D printing, and other cutting-edge healthcare technologies.", "For both medical device approval and market access, evidence thresholds are evolving globally, driven by regulatory changes designed to improve patient safety and device effectiveness and to enable healthcare systems to better cope with cost constraints and the advent of new technologies.", "More specifically, this means that being able to prove safety relative to an equivalent offering will no longer represent a sufficient threshold for market access; regulations are gradually evolving to require comparative studies, longer-term data, and evidence packages that include demonstrations of economic and clinical benefit.", "It is also important to note that providers are increasingly analyzing the value that a new medical device will offer based on a broader set of questions than in the past.", "So, in addition to evaluating treatment effectiveness and cost when making purchasing decisions, providers will also consider factors such as readmission reduction, operational efficiencies, discharge compliance, and various other aspects of patient satisfaction.", "Macrotrend 2: Increased Demand for and Access to Innovative Therapies", "New Treatment Paradigms and Expedited Market Access Initiatives", "As companies continue to develop innovative and disruptive technologies, treatment paradigms are shifting, and patients and providers alike are increasingly calling for improved access to such products; many regulatory bodies are thus introducing initiatives to expedite the availability of new technologies on the market.", "One example of this is the FDA’s Breakthrough Device Designation Program, which prioritizes submissions of medical devices and combination products that have the potential to improve treatment for life-threatening and other debilitating conditions.", "Since its introduction, this program has helped increase the number of innovative medical devices approved annually in the US.", "In Europe, on the other hand, the upcoming implementation of the MDR, which includes stricter safety and effectiveness provisions than its predecessor, may hinder access to innovative products in the short term.", "However, the improved safety and effectiveness requirements of these new regulations are expected to ultimately support confidence in the products that are available on the market and subsequently support the uptake of innovative devices and products.", "The challenges faced by the EU in introducing these regulations over recent years illustrate the difficulty of balancing patient safety with providing access to innovative therapies, which remains one of the central challenges in regulating medtech innovation worldwide.", "Nonetheless, innovative therapies continue to be developed at a faster rate than ever before, and regulatory bodies will therefore continue to seek out methods of providing patients with access to the most effective treatments while maintaining patient safety and satisfaction.", "Companies that are well prepared to cope with treatment paradigm shifts, particularly those that are the forefront of innovation efforts, will be well positioned for future success in this space.", "Potentially the most pivotal aspect of this macrotrend is that patients are gradually playing a larger role in treatment decision making and design, driving increased consumer responsibility and engagement.", "This is partly due to the increased cost-sharing burden that patients have assumed, as well as improved access to information that allows patients to be more involved in care decisions, such as sources from regulatory bodies, patient-directed websites, and patient forums.", "In addition, patients are also becoming more involved in regulatory processes; the FDA’s CDRH, for instance, oversees a patient engagement advisory committee and now considers patient preference and patient-report outcomes in regulatory decision making.", "Other regulatory bodies, such as those in Australia, are gradually moving in this direction as well.", "Companies are also increasingly relying on patients to improve product design; for example, GE Healthcare redesigned its mammography machines with the help of patients, resulting in a remote control that allows patients to control the amount and speed of breast compression, which has been shown to enable increased compression, thereby improving imaging and diagnostic capabilities.", "Macrotrend 3: Evolution of Delivery and Payment Models", "Spurred by cost constraints and an ongoing shift toward value-based care, consolidation and vertical integration are being increasingly used in order to increase efficiency and purchasing power and to share risk and align incentives across the value chain.", "This is best exemplified by independent hospitals that continue to join health systems, even outside of metropolitan centers.", "Moreover, acquisitions are increasingly featuring outpatient facilities, such as community-based physician practices and ambulatory surgical centers.", "This is driven primarily by the growth of outpatient treatment volumes, which has in recent years surpassed that of hospital treatment volumes due to the increased availability of minimally invasive treatments that can be performed in non-hospital settings, as well as generally heightened patient convenience and improved cost effectiveness in outpatient settings.", "As a result, a number of providers – including HCA healthcare, the largest health system in the US – have been working to bolster their focus on ASC and physician practice acquisitions.", "Payers are also consolidating into larger national systems in order to increase scale, efficiency, and leverage on costs.", "Additionally, payers are routing patients to their preferred IDNs, particularly those that align with them on costs and outcomes.", "This has increased the willingness of providers to assume risk and work with payers as partners.", "Furthermore, there is also a movement toward vertical integration in the healthcare industry, which has supported new partnerships and acquisitions across different types of stakeholders along the healthcare value chain.", "This is mainly due to the potential for greater cost savings, outcomes improvements, more effective risk sharing, and more coordinated care afforded by the combination of various stakeholders into large, overarching entities.", "Vertical integration has been mostly driven by payers, such as UnitedHealth Group, which owns Optum—a company that includes providers, pharmacy benefit management, and a data and analytics branch.", "Market evolution and changing decision-maker influence is leading to new payment and delivery frameworks that focus on value.", "While significant variability continues to exist between providers, an increasing percentage of system encounters are now tied to quality or value – as opposed to volume – through alternative payment models, and commercial payers have increasingly opted to follow the government’s lead in value-based payment models; in fact, in a survey conducted by the Health Care Payment Learning & Action Network, 90% of payers indicated that they believed value-focused payment activity would continue to increase in the future.", "As a result, while payment options will continue to include fee-for-service models in some cases, payers are increasingly shifting toward bundled or episode-based models, payment-by-condition models, and ultimately population health payment models.", "In this way, governments and commercial payers are forcing providers to take on more risk and work as partners beyond singular treatment episodes.", "Such continued payment model reform is also driving the rise of value-based contracting (VBC) in the healthcare space; as providers agree to share more risk with payers, vendors such as pharmaceutical and medical device companies will face increasing pressure to share risk with providers.", "The main three reasons that are supporting the uptake of VBC are as follows:", "1) Companies are increasingly looking for ways to engage effectively with non-clinical stakeholders; these stakeholders care about a different set of parameters than the historical customer, which was the physician, and are constantly looking for agreements around cost and outcomes.", "2) Risk distribution is gradually changing to include manufacturers, which are increasingly sharing risk with hospitals and health systems.", "This allows manufacturers to place specific guarantees surrounding the outcomes that their devices provide, and bolsters accountability for various nontraditional stakeholders, thereby improving quality of care.", "3) The healthcare ecosystem is increasingly focused on cost management, presenting an incentive for various players to align their efforts in order to provide high-quality care at the lowest possible cost.", "The definition of a “customer” has and will continue to evolve to incorporate the roles of multiple stakeholders; physicians – which are the traditional medtech key customers – will retain influence, but will gradually cede control to administrative stakeholders.", "In addition, multi-stakeholder committees, increasingly from more centralized positions within larger hospital systems or networks, have become mainly responsible for authorizing brand selection decisions.", "Because hospitals typically operate at very low margins, non-clinical stakeholders have helped control costs to a greater extent that when physicians represented the main customers by limiting the number of available brands, increasing purchasing power, and bolstering focus on product rationalization and outcomes-based pricing.", "Macrotrend 4: Technology-Enabled Care and Stakeholder Engagement", "Technology-enabled care and stakeholder engagement is creating new possibilities for healthcare delivery and changing the way various stakeholders interact and receive information; this trend is being realized through efforts such as drug-device-digital convergence and new partnership models between OEMs, physicians, and patients.", "One example of such convergence is the ABILIFY MYCITE pill, which consists of a sensor from Proteus Digital Health and anti-psychotic medication from Otsuka and can be connected to a mobile app.", "The overall product is purported to help reduce compliance and dosing issues that are common with anti-psychotic drugs because it enables patients to monitor their drug intake, record how they are feeling, and share that information with their caregivers through a web-based portal if they choose to.", "Other examples of convergence include several partnerships between diabetes management device manufacturers and technology companies aimed at improving glucose level management.", "The Medtronic-IBM partnership, for instance, resulted in the Sugar. IQ app, which combines the former’s CGM technology with the latter’s AI capabilities; similar partnerships have been observed between Sanofi and Verily, Roche and mySugr, and Dexcom and Fitbit.", "Digital healthcare is increasingly embedded in provider EHR workflows, as evidenced by the increased availability of products such as Suki, a clinical voice assistant that can help with clinical notetaking.", "In addition, digital and social channels have become the primary means for health education patient engagement – there is no longer a single point of contact for this information.", "Patients can now be reached through health apps, patient portals and forums, EHRs and manufacturer websites, and wearable technologies, which is spurring manufacturers and other stakeholders to embrace new types of engagement opportunities.", "Macrotrend 5: Data-Enabled Engagement and Information", "In addition to the increased availability of data from sources such as healthcare claims, EHRs, social listening, and facility purchasing data, government and consumer initiatives have also made huge volumes of data available in recent years, leading to increased patient engagement in healthcare decisions.", "Examples of such initiatives include the Health and Human Service Data Liberation Initiative, the ACA and HITECH act in the US, and the Joint Action on Health Information in Europe; such programs can improve healthcare reporting policies, bolster data infrastructure, enhance data security, and lead to the creation of new tools that can further impact data and evidence generation.", "For instance, OTC genetic tests, which are approved as medical devices, are enabling self-diagnosis and earlier treatment; patients can also opt in to allow their genetic profiles to be use in clinical studies, providing new avenues for data collection and analysis.", "Other examples include the increasing utilization of wearable-generated data in healthcare decisions.", "As the available data expand, data privacy and security will represent an increasingly significant concern for patients and physicians alike.", "In fact, this has already been observed to a certain degree in some markets, such as that for insulin pumps, where the potential for hacking internet-connected devices has raised fears surrounding patient safety and privacy; in response, regulatory bodies have been developing guidance to target device cybersecurity.", "This trend is expected to intensify over the coming few years.", "– Hospital consolidation will continue and a number of big-power mega systems will emerge,", "– Payment models designed to reward value will dominate in the future market landscape,", "– Provider desire to share risk will increase the prevalence of value-based contracts,", "– Payers will be an increasingly important stakeholder, due to their impact on patient routing,", "– Physician will retain influence but will cede control to administrative stakeholders,", "– Business model experimentation will continue as manufacturers change their strategies to succeed.", "A successful customer engagement model will do the following going forward:", "– Prioritize focus on organized customer groups and strategic accounts and develop a robust and local ecosystem-specific strategy to win business; this must include a successful approach to engaging with strategic enterprise accounts,", "– Enhance customer-facing teams to address converging customer interests of clinical and economic value,", "– Increase coordination and collaboration between medical/HEOR and commercial teams; most companies do this through separate groups, but these expertise and messaging will increasingly need to be developed and delivered together,", "– Expand capabilities to support ongoing clinical and economic evidence development; in particular, it is crucial to have a life-cycle management strategy that includes planning iterations and data-generation efforts to show economic value,", "– Engender a greater understanding and enablement of patient journey, which will help stakeholders better understand how they can contribute and partner across the spectrum of care."]}

Ahn, who specializes in diabetes technology, believes that in the U.S., the Libre will be more useful for people with type 2 diabetes.", "Most people with type 2 do not use CGMs and may also not perform frequent fingerstick checks.", "\"I think it's something that really empowers people, and that's what's really exciting, Ahn says. \"[Y]ou literally see firsthand what exercise, diet, rest, and stress do to your blood sugars.\"", "Of course, he adds, \"There's benefit really for everybody, but the most important question is where is the cost justified.", "I would say that at least right now, it probably is only worth the cost for someone on insulin, especially on fast-acting insulin.\"", "Jared Watkin president of Abbott Diabetes Care Division, tells Shots that the Libre was designed for people with either type of diabetes who require frequent glucose testing, and the lack of alarms was intentional.", "Research shows \"alarm fatigue\" is one of two main reasons many patients mention for not wanting to use CGM systems, he says.", "He points out that research on the Libre has also shown that people using the device achieve better glucose control and experience fewer low blood sugar episodes overnight compared to fingersticks alone even without the alarms, presumably because they're making more insulin dose adjustments.", "Aaron Kowalski is the chief mission officer for JDRF, formerly the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation, which funds much of the research into diabetes technologies.", "He says it will be interesting to see how U.S. patients with type 1 diabetes who haven't adopted CGM take to the Libre.", "\"If you're coming at it from fingersticking, it makes massive sense ... For some people with type 1, I think it will be a really good option.\"", "Both continuous glucose sensing and fast-acting insulin are critical components to the development of so-called \"closed-loop\" or artificial pancreas systems, which aim to automate insulin delivery to the point that patients themselves don't need to make complicated and error-prone calculations about how many carbs are in their meals or how much to cut back their insulin doses for exercise.", "In September 2016, The U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved Medtronic's 670G, the first device that partially accomplishes the closed-loop goal via an algorithm that allows the system's CGM to instruct its insulin pump to cut off delivery if the user's blood sugar drops, or increase it if the levels go too high.", "Several other companies are working on similar technology. One of those, a start-up called Bigfoot Biomedical is working with Abbott to use a next-generation version of the Libre's sensor.", "Except for Medtronic, the other major closed-loop competitors – Insulet, Tandem, and Beta-Bionics – are all collaborating with Dexcom.", "At the same time, a group of do-it-yourself hackers has figured out how to create their own closed-loop systems using older equipment and instructions that are freely available.", "Since that endeavor isn't regulated by the FDA, people who have done it – believed to number in the thousands at this point – proceed at their own risk.", "As might be expected, not everything in this field has gone smoothly. Due to both high demand and the fact that one of Medtronic's manufacturing plants located in Puerto Rico was damaged by Hurricane Maria, it has been unable to ship part of the 670G to new users, and may not be able to meet demand until 2018.", "In addition, the insurance company Anthem has said it won't cover the 670G because it has concluded \"there is not yet enough data on the longer-term safety and efficacy\" for the system.", "Meanwhile, although Medicare agreed in January 2017 to cover the Dexcom continuous glucose monitor for beneficiaries who use insulin, the agency recently determined that the device would not be covered if beneficiaries use the accompanying smartphone app that reads the glucose levels via bluetooth, because it doesn't meet the definition for \"durable medical equipment.\"", "The decision means that seniors have to carry around a separate receiver device, and don't have access to the share function.", "Dexcom is negotiating with federal regulators to work out a solution. In a recent blog post, Ahn wrote \"While CGM approval by Dexcom is a huge win overall (it really is), restricting smartphone integration is absolutely ridiculous.\"", "In another blow to the diabetes technology world, major pump manufacturer Animus recently announced that it was pulling out of the market and is shifting its approximately 90,000 current customers to Medtronic.", "Not surprisingly, some of Medtronic's competitors are offering deals to lure them to their own products.", "Despite the roadblocks, Kowalski says, \"I have tremendous optimism about the future for people with type 1 diabetes.", "These tools are really starting to ... improving blood sugar and making life easier.

people with diabetes for more than eight years,” she says.", "“After Hurricane Katrina, I founded The Diabetes Center in Ocean Springs, Mississippi, to provide better access to care for patients with diabetes.”", "Now with three NPs on staff serving the Mississippi Gulf Coast, The Diabetes Center continues to make a difference for patients every day.", "“NPs can be on the cutting edge of technology,” Ms. Arnold says, “and we can become proficient in the technology that patients want to use, like continuous glucose monitoring [CGM] devices.”", "Ms. Arnold has followed advances in diabetes technology for decades, including the advent of CGM. “Ultimately, it’s about offering patients what they need to help them better manage their diabetes,” she notes.", "“Much has changed since the advent of the first CGM devices, including now their ability to work with insulin pumps, their availability at pharmacies and Medicare regulations.", "It’s truly a process in keeping up with how to get patients access to these devices and what device is right for their needs — but patients are asking about these tools, so we as clinicians need to be able to provide assistance.”", "Different than personal CGM devices, professional CGM programs offer people with diabetes the ability to use CGM devices for short periods of time so both they and their diabetes care team can optimize diabetes self-management through user-generated data.", "With a professional CGM program, clinicians can download information from the patient’s device and pull it into the patient’s electronic health records (EHRs) digitally — even if patients aren’t in the office — to stay informed of daily blood sugar changes and to identify patterns in behavior.", "“It’s the patterns we see that make a difference for the patient,” Ms. Arnold says. “It’s looking at what’s happening over a period of time to identify the source of a problem, and these reports offer a more complete picture of a patient’s history.”", "However, research has found that integrating CGM technology into clinical practice presents various challenges, including concerns about time constraints, a lack of resources, not enough training or the need for a systematic approach to interpret data.", "To address these clinician barriers to a professional CGM program, Ms. Arnold was a reviewer for the Professional Continuous Glucose Monitoring Implementation Playbook, made available through a partnership between the American Association of Diabetes Educators (AADE) and the American Association of Nurse Practitioners® (AANP).", "This playbook is designed to outline the steps needed to set up a professional CGM program in your practice and offers case studies, details on how to work with patients on selecting a device and clinical guidelines.", "It also provides worksheets as hands-on tools to walk you through putting a program in place.", "“It’s important to complete the worksheets to develop an internal process for your clinic — and to begin thinking about billing and coding,” says Ms. Arnold, noting that practices must purchase professional CGM devices up front so they can be available to patients when needed.", "“Mapping out the billing process before you begin will help prevent the delivery of non-covered services, and you can also speak with the device companies for help implementing a CGM program into your practice.”", "Previously, Mississippi’s statewide policy prevented NPs from signing the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration’s Insulin-treated Diabetes Mellitus Assessment Form.", "This resulted in NPs like Ms. Arnold, who is also board certified in advanced diabetes management, not being able to properly assist patients in filling out the forms needed to keep their livelihood as commercial drivers.", "So, she advocated to change state regulations. “Patients used to be required to have this form be signed by endocrinologist.", "Now, NPs can sign in our state and get people back to doing the job they need to do,” she says. “Everywhere I speak, I always bring up the point that patients safely using insulin to treat their diabetes can get a commercial driver’s license through the diabetes assessment form and then proceeding with the physical examination by a licensed medical examiner.”", "The form specifically requires at least three months of ongoing blood glucose self-monitoring records measured with an electronic glucometer that stores all readings, records the date and", "time of readings and from which data can be electronically downloaded. “With professional CGM programs, patients can be using a CGM device as this three-month log,” says Ms. Arnold, noting that this is just one way in which this technology can improve patient’s lives.", "“It’s amazing to see that, when I place a CGM device or insulin pump, patients’ chronic illness changes and, many times, can improve right in front of us to become better controlled.”"]}

It could just be that the point in each case is to affirm one against the other, as with Marxist critiques of liberalism and Hegelianism and, conversely, liberal and Hegelian critiques of Marxism.", "But the authors here can for the most part be seen as taking the relations they establish (between Marx and Hegel and between Marx and liberalism) as being productive, that is, generating new positions or understandings.", "How then might we describe or label the positions which could result from these productive interrelations?", "Starting with the Marx-Hegel relationship, I take my lead from the distinction made by Joe McCarney (one of the founders of the Marx and Philosophy Society), between on the one hand, ‘Hegelian Marxism’, and on the other hand, ‘Marxist Hegelianism’.", "The former – ‘Hegelian Marxism’ – is a version of Marxism, one which emphasizes its Hegelian character, as we find for example with Lukács.", "(Note that this Hegelian Marxism could be intended either as an explicit reconstruction or development of Marxian theory or as an interpretation of what that theory originally involved.)", "The latter– ‘Marxist Hegelianism’ – is a version of Hegelianism, one which turns or transforms it in a Marxist direction, as we find perhaps in Adorno.", "In both cases the emphasis falls on the second component, which the first, notwithstanding its prominence, is merely meant to modify or inflect – thus Hegelian Marxism and Marxist Hegelianism.", "A parallel distinction could then be drawn between, on the one hand, ‘liberal Marxism’, and on the other hand, ‘Marxist liberalism’.", "So I therefore identify four possible positions which could emerge on the basis of the positive and productive endeavours to relate Marx to either Hegel or liberalism.", "Where then do the contributors to this collection end up in relation to this matrix?", "The volume contains one – and only one – exposition of what we can clearly identify as Hegelian Marxism: this is the final piece by Sean Sayers, in which he argues that Marx’s theory of history is thoroughly Hegelian in structure, and then uses this account to criticize the anti-Hegelian post-Marxism of Badiou.", "The term ‘Hegelian Marxism’ does not itself feature here, but Sayer’s presumably self-penned description at the end of the book has him down as having ‘written extensively on many areas of philosophy from a Hegelian-Marxist perspective’ (274).", "The claim that Marx’s theory of history is Hegelian in character certainly has a lot going for it and is no doubt one of the main reasons for affirming Hegelian Marxism.", "The other papers dealing with Marx in relation to Hegel do not have much to say about either’s theory of history; the one exception is Frederick Neuhouser, who argues that Marx’s expectations for communism are insufficiently dialectical or Hegelian, given that they do not allow for the proper Aufhebung of the achievements of the bourgeois liberal epoch, specifically liberal rights.", "In fact I recall when Neuhouser gave a version of the paper to the Marx and Philosophy Society conference back in 2012, Sayers questioned him on precisely this point, suggesting that Marx is by no means committed to disdaining bourgeois individuality, but rather sees this as one of the great achievements of modernity, one which communism will develop.", "Neuhouser responded by agreeing in general, but still insisting that the programmatic conclusions of ‘On the Jewish Question’ cut against this.", "The issue therefore becomes two-fold: on the one hand, to what degree and in what forms does Marx think that bourgeois individualism will be positively transformed in communism?", "And on the other hand, does this transformation still operate within the Hegelian pattern or does it instead seriously alter or even break that pattern?", "Neuhouser thinks that the transformation Marx envisages is insufficiently preservative and therefore undialectical; Sayers presumably thinks otherwise.", "There is no doubt more to say about the specific issue of liberal rights, but for now we just need to note the general thrust of Neuhouser’s approach, which is to urge that Marx be placed back into the Hegelian frame in order to rectify deficiencies in his own position.", "Marx, to be sure, has much to add to Hegel, especially in terms of his analysis and criticism of ‘civil society’, but unfortunately tends to move too far away from Hegel in the manner in which he develops these ideas.", "Neuhouser therefore argues that we need as it were to rescue Marx from himself by making him more of an Hegelian; in fact, given Neuhouser’s general endorsement of a suitably updated Hegelian social and political philosophy, updated in part by reference to Marx, his position could be said, at least in this paper, to instantiate a form of Marxist Hegelianism.", "In which case, the disagreement between Sayers and Neuhouser then represents the divergence between Hegelian Marxism and Marxist Hegelianism.", "Neuhouser’s approach exemplifies that taken by most of the contributors who deal with Marx in relation to Hegel.", "Moggach, Ikäheimo, Schmidt am Busch and Neuhouser all claim that Hegel’s social and political philosophy is more philosophically sophisticated and defensible than Marx’s; where Marx does well, they argue, he does so by developing or applying Hegelian ideas; where he goes wrong, it is by discarding them.", "A reiterated theme is Marx’s rejection of liberal rights; more generally, Marx is charged with disregarding the normative significance of rational individual reflexivity.", "He is said to ‘seem naïve’ (Schmidt am Busch, 112) in respect of his failure to attend to issues of ‘institutional mediation’, if not guilty of ‘romantic fantasy’ (Ikäheimo, 97).", "The sense then that the best we can do with Marx is to use him to reinfuse Hegelianism involves returning to the spirit, if not the letter, of Left / Young Hegelianism, which helpfully is the subject of Emmanuel Renault’s contribution.", "Renault argues that we must understand the early Marx as operating within the intellectual movement of Left and Young Hegelianism, and not simply as taking Left and Young Hegelian positions as the targets of his criticisms.", "This approach is more a matter of reconstructing the philosophical context of Marx’s early ideas rather than evaluating them, as we find with Neuhouser and the others.", "But it nonetheless confirms the sense we get from Neuhouser and the others that the best way to understand and indeed appropriate Marx is in terms of Marxist – or more generally – Left Hegelianism.", "The one (partial) exception to the otherwise predominant tendency of the contributors here to fold Marx back into Hegel comes with Andrew Chitty’s remarkably detailed reconstruction of Hegel’s and Marx’s arguments for human solidarity.", "Whilst noting the extent to which their respective arguments have much in common, he also wants to insist on the important differences, thereby allowing Marx to emerge as a thinker in his own right, not one who always needs to be grounded in Hegel.", "That said, the results of this exercise are rather equivocal, and in three respects. Firstly, Chitty has to concede that Hegel’s argument is more philosophically satisfactory than Marx’s, specifically in virtue of its being based on an account of rational reflexivity, rather than being pitched in empirical, naturalistic terms (139).", "To this extent, his approach coincides with what we find in Moggach and Schmidt am Busch. (But this evaluation presupposes, following Kant, that philosophy should be concerned with such transcendental grounding; might we not instead suppose that Marx was right to proceed in a more Aristotelian direction?)", "Secondly, the advantage Chitty sees in Marx’s argument is that it can be extended to justify a genuinely human form of solidarity, one that can and should have global reach.", "Hegel, by contrast, seems to be concerned only with a more limited version of solidarity, one realized within particular social settings (specifically the contemporary constitutional state).", "But could it not be argued that Hegel’s particularism in this respect is inconsistent with the universalism implicit in his account of self-consciousness (and spirit), and so a prime target for a ‘Left Hegelian’ critique?", "Thirdly, this latter suggestion then connects with an issue which does not feature in Chitty’s paper as published here, but which he did touch on – briefly – in the version he delivered at the Marx and Philosophy Society conference in 2016, namely the different ways in which Hegel’s and Marx’s accounts of social or human solidarity figure in their accounts of human history.", "The difference Chitty identifies between Hegel’s limited, socially-defined version of solidarity and Marx’s implicitly human, global version surely also reflects the different purposes of their theories of history, Hegel concerned to establish what has happened (the advent of state-based solidarity), Marx by contrast what is going to happen (the advent of global solidarity)?", "Let me now consider whether the contributors who discuss Marx in relation to liberalism can be understood in terms of the distinction between liberal Marxism and Marxist liberalism.", "Unlike the previous distinction (Hegelian Marxism / Marxist Hegelianism), which doesn’t as such figure in the book, this distinction does, or very nearly does, as it does clearly relate to the endeavour of the relevant contributors to bring Marxism and liberalism together, or at least closer together.", "This project is exemplified in the very title of Reiman’s chapter, ‘Marxian Liberalism’, which the editor says is better understood as ‘a liberal theory modified by certain Marxist beliefs rather than a Marxist theory modified by liberal ones’ (Kandiyali, 13), thus exactly describing the difference between what I have called Marxist liberalism and liberal Marxism.", "And I think that ‘Marxist liberalism’ is reasonably accurate way of characterizing the contributions of Moggach, Neuhouser, Reiman, Sypnowich, Brudney and Kandiyali, given the manner in which they aim both to save liberalism from Marx’s criticisms but also take on board some of Marx’s diagnostic claims about capitalism.", "My inclusion of Sypnowich in this list cuts against the editor’s claim in his Introduction that Sypnowich is arguing that ‘Marx provides an attractive alternative’ to liberal egalitarianism (9).", "This could be thought to mis-state Sypnowich’s argument in two respects. Firstly, her position seems rather to be that the ideal of human flourishing found in Marx ‘can correct the deficiencies of contemporary liberal argument’ (188), and accordingly is intended to supplement and transform liberal egalitarianism rather than contest or replace it; and so follows in the line of attempts to ‘bring together Marxist and liberal egalitarian theory’ (Sypnowich quoting Jonathan Wolff, 192), in the form of a ‘Left-liberal marriage’ (Sypnowich quoting Will Kymlicka, 192).", "Secondly, it is not so much Marx as the socialist tradition (201) more generally to which Sypnowich appeals– hence references to Morris, Tawney and Laski, as well as Marx – and even non-socialists, such as Beveridge (194).", "The resulting position is one which stands sufficiently at odds with mainstream liberal egalitarianism to count as an ‘alternative’ to it, but I am not sure really warrants the epithet ‘Marxist’; rather, socialist egalitarianism, or liberal socialism?", "So what then of liberal Marxism itself – does this have any adherents amongst the contributors? Well, the editor – Jan Kandiyali – certainly seems to want this to be the case: his introduction attributes what he calls ‘a more liberal version of Marxism’ to two of the authors we’ve already considered, Neuhouser and Reiman (8).", "Now I think this is somewhat wishful on his part; as I’ve already indicated, Kandiyali goes on to (accurately) characterize Reiman’s project as ‘a more Marxist version of liberalism’ (13) rather than the other way around; if this is the case with Reiman, then it is even more so with Neuhouser.", "The closest we get to ‘liberal Marxism’ in fact comes in the form of Kandiyali’s own contribution, which examines the theme of specialization in Schiller and Marx in an admirably clear and thought-provoking way.", "In this piece Kandiyali is concerned to emphasize the liberalism – i.e., the ethical individualism – within Marx’s philosophy.", "He himself doesn’t make this explicit, but his overall strategy of a) aligning Marx with Schiller (the latter identified as liberal: 239, 246), and b) contesting the characterization of Marx as a collectivist ‘opponent of liberal individualism’ (239), I think justifies my take on his account.", "This is a somewhat different kind of liberalism, to be sure, than the one recommended by Moggach, Neuhouser and others; that is, it is not one which is fixated on rights (and therefore also coercion), but instead centres on the idea of free personal development, which we can take to be the core value at the heart of much of the best of philosophical liberalism (e.g., J.S. Mill) – and with it hostility towards what Kandiyali calls the ‘collectivist vision of self-realization’ (257).", "On this account, Marx himself would be the original ‘liberal Marxist’! Kandiyali is obviously sympathetic to this position, though doesn’t want whole-heartedly to endorse it, certainly not given some of the more utopian forms it takes in Marx’s thought.", "Kandiyali’s consideration of what I am somewhat provocatively calling Marx’s liberal individualism proceeds on the basis of an examination of the alienating effects of productive specialization.", "He starts by quoting a famous passage from Schiller:", "That polypoid character of the Greek States, in which every individual enjoyed an independent existence but could, when need arose, grow into the whole organism, now made way for an ingenious clock-work, in which, out of the piecing together of innumerable but lifeless parts, a mechanical collective life ensued….", "Everlastingly chained to a single little fragment of the Whole, man himself develops into nothing but a fragment; … he never develops the harmony of his being.", "(On the Aesthetic Education of Man, sixth letter, cited 242)", "What I find striking here is the contrast between the organic and the mechanical; Schiller does not in fact seem to be critical of specialization per se, but rather of mechanical specialization; it is not being part of a whole that is pernicious, but being a ‘lifeless’ part, one which does not feel itself to be part of the whole, does not understand and affirm its functioning within the collective.", "This then connects with much of what Marx conveys in his critique of specialization: it is not so much specialization that he objects to as capitalist specialization, as this is, as Kandiyali notes, ‘involuntary’ and ‘coercive’ (258) and results in social atomization or alienation.", "Modern Industry imposes the necessity of recognizing, as a fundamental law of production, variation of work….", "[It] compels society to replace the worker of today, crippled by life-long repetition of one and the same trivial operation, and thus reduced to a mere fragment of a man, by the fully developed individual, fit for a variety of labours, ready to face any change of production, and to whom the different social functions he performs, are but so many modes of giving free scope to his own natural and acquired powers.", "Here Marx makes two claims. The first is that machinery and modern industry will eradicate, or at least significantly reduce, the demand for specialists and finely developed skills.", "Rather than being a specialist in one line of activity, the worker of the future will be a generalist, capable of turning their hand to whatever task society requires.", "The second is that this is a positive development, for it will lead to a higher development of human powers….", "Both claims are open to doubt. The first claim, while not entirely false, is exaggerated… [M]ore than a century and a half since Marx penned those words, there remain a number of highly skilled jobs in our economy.", "What Marx seemed to overlook here is the fact that, as well as reducing the demand for certain skills, technological advancement also creates a need for new skills and new specializations.", "I think this gets things wrong. Marx is comparing a) the ‘crippled’ condition of the worker in contemporary large-scale industry with b) the ‘the fully developed’ worker in the imminent future.", "Kandiyali has the transition from a) to b) as ‘eradicating’ or ‘reducing’ ‘the demand for specialists and finely developed skills’, but this description hardly fits with the passage from Capital.", "He backs up his interpretation by citing a line from Marx that modern industry ‘wipes out specialists’ – but this comes from The Poverty of Philosophy, published twenty-one years before Volume One of Capital, where Marx is describing the transition from craft production to precisely the kind of large-scale industry in which the worker is condemned to being ‘crippled by life-long repetition of one and the same trivial operation’.", "Kandiyali goes on to argue that this claim is ‘exaggerated’, if not ‘refuted’, given the manner in which ‘technological advancement […] creates the demand for new skills and new specializations’ (250).", "But surely this is why the worker of the future will need to be ‘fit for a variety of labours’? That said, the passage from Capital does more generally fit with Kandiyali’s account, given the expectation that individuals will be able to ‘perform different social functions’ and thereby ‘give free scope to their own natural and acquired powers’.", "But again, this indicates that the problem isn’t specialization as such, but the fixity of specialization given the industrial / capitalist division of labour.", "Just as I think Schiller is in effect recommending organicist collectivism as the solution to mechanical specialization, so too is Marx.", "The value of ‘perform[ing] different social functions’ isn’t just that one then gets to exercise more of one’s own capacities; one also gets to identify with the social whole of which one is – in various ways – a part.", "My response to Kandiyali’s argument is therefore two-fold: i) specialization as such is not the real problem for Marx, but rather fixed or mechanical specialization; ii) the solution Marx envisages to this problem is by no means as individualistic as Kandiyali suggests.", "Further support for this rejoinder comes when we realize that even on Kandiyali’s account specialization is not the real problem, as his focus increasingly moves away from specialization to what he calls ‘mundane work’ (251, 252) and ‘mundane labour’ (255).", "Moreover, one of the solutions Kandiyali considers leaves specialization completely untouched; according to him, Schiller and Marx both hold that the (alleged) problem can be resolved by a change of attitude; so for Marx, he suggests, specialized work can be undertaken ‘in a unalienated fashion under communism’ if it is motivated by a concern for others as such (251: this is his take on the ‘Comments on James Mill’ passage treated by many of the other contributors).", "But surely this is to conceive of one’s own specialism as functioning for the benefit of the whole?", "Kandiyali is keen to present what I am no doubt tendentiously calling a ‘liberal Marxism’, one which sets itself against what he refers to as the Hegelian’s ‘collectivist vision of self-realization’ (257).", "But I am not convinced that it is genuinely Marxist. So once again, back to Hegel?"]}

You announced a partnership with Livongo, and something with [Eli] Lilly [and Company]?", "Lilly had been announced earlier. We formalized a relationship with Lilly where we’ve been working for quite some time to develop interconnected devices with Lilly as they develop insulin delivery systems.", "They have pens that are going to have Bluetooth connection capability and they’re working on an insulin delivery system as well for themselves, and our CGM will be integrated into the software platforms that they built.", "So we’ll provide them CGM data and patients will be able to view CGM data on their apps.", "And the Livongo announcement, that’s a data relationship. You know Livongo has a coaching platform and they coach patients based on, right now, fingersticks.", "Our relationship with them is through our APIs. And what we will do is provide them data, and their coaches and analytics can go through the CGM data and see if there’s recommendations that they would offer patients based upon what they see there.", "We believe it will provide a much richer experience for those patients.", "Livongo’s interesting. They got a lot of press this year because of their IPO, and a lot of people are aware of the space they’re in who weren’t before.", "But on the hardware side, they’re not super sophisticated; it’s just a white-labeled glucometer that has been around for ages.", "So it’s interesting to see them connecting to parts of the industry where the technology is cutting edge, like Dexcom.", "We’re glad we’re connecting to them. We’ve certainly worked with and spoken to others. Onduo, Verily’s diabetes management platform, has been taking data from us to power their stuff forever.", "I presented some UnitedHealthcare data yesterday in my presentation whereby they’re working on developing diabetes data and metrics based on CGM data.", "And we’ve even done some of this stuff on our own. So we’re looking at every possible angle to grow our business and provide patients with what they want.", "If patients truly want a Livongo experience and their software is better than anything we can develop, then — look, they’re buying sensors, they’re using our sensors, it’s all good.", "And we have to look at what are we best at. What we’re best at is making great sensors and making sensors that are safe and sensors that are accurate.", "And we’re good at the app we’ve created and the stuff we’ve done.", "But if somebody wants to make a sensor for some completely different use in a market they understand better than us, why not serve up our sensor data to them and let them put it in that platform?", "I’ve been talking to several folks in the diabetes space the last couple days here at JPM about how incredibly fast the space has moved in the past five years.", "It’s moved incredibly fast in the past five years. Because that’s when we were the first company to ever go to the phone.", "We went directly to the mobile platform in 2015. And once that happened, all these avenues are open because you now have data that can go from a body to a server that’s real medical data.", "One of our board members said something really interesting. I’m a doctor, I’ve been at this forever, but CGM really is what personalized medicine was supposed to be when we started way back when.", "And this is where you have an opportunity to create personalized medicine for people with actionable information out of this data.", "Watching you guys, Abbott, Medtronic and Senseonics to some extent — there’s something of a market share race going on, right?", "Let’s take a step back. We’ve grown remarkably over the last couple years. We’re over 40% growth, compounded every year since 2010.", "So our growth trajectory has been nothing short of remarkable. Our strategy has been to make our product very much fit within the Type 1 market for insulin-using patients and to seek reimbursement.", "We’ve not rolled out highly-expensive cash pay platforms or gone the commercial route that many of our competitors have at this point in time.", "I think over the next several years you’ll see us move that way. They have grabbed a bunch of patients in Europe, but our Europe business is growing nicely too.", "And you do have a well-known brand and a relationship with patients.", "We do! And if we do something wrong, they’re also very happy to let us know. It’s OK.", "What does 2020 look like for you? What are you excited about?", "The first thing we’re excited about is we’re going to double our G6, our current product manufacturing capacity, again this year.", "We have been capacity-constrained ever since we launched that product. So we’ve not been able to go do some of the aggressive commercial things that we would have liked to have done as far as getting word out to more people.", "Has that bottleneck been on the manufacturing side?", "It has — not only with us, but with our component suppliers. So we’re beefing up our supply chain as well as our internal stuff.", "We do have a big G7 year planned. We’ve finalized our product configuration and we’re down pretty much to the end on that where we should be.", "We’ll start our clinical studies and execute those.", "But our 2020 launch is going to be a limited launch; it’s not going to be a big launch. If we’ve learned one lesson from the G6 platform, it’s that we can’t possibly launch this product when we’re not ready to produce tens of millions of them.", "With G6 we got an early approval and rather than wait until we’d built up a bunch of inventory we rolled it out.", "And we’ve been running out of product every month ever since, pretty much. We’re not going to do that again.", "When we get G7 approved, what we’re going to do is we’re going to build up inventory and when we launch it we’ll turn on the faucet and have availability across the board.", "So that’s more of a 2021 event rather than a 2020 event.", "What’s the big leap from G6 to G7, especially in terms of patient experience?", "The first thing they get is size. The G7, it’s smaller than a [Freestyle] Libre. It is probably in diameter a little smaller than a quarter, a little bigger than a nickel, and it doesn’t sit up very high.", "It is very easy to use — it’s literally a two-step insertion.", "We’re working on a longer-labeled application, 14 or 15 days. That length of wear will be determined by the accuracy of the data.", "Our current product is a 10-day standard. So we’ll see. That’s currently the plan of record to get it out that far.", "It’s just a different experience for our patients. Right now for example we have a transmitter that pops in, so you have to buy a transmitter and a sensor.", "No more transmitters. It’s one thing, you peel it off, you pop it in. You don’t have to put anything together.", "Does it have a separate receiver or go straight to the phone?", "We will offer a separate receiver because there are patients who don’t want to go to the phone. But we’ll also have it go straight to the phone.", "Getting smaller, lasting longer, getting more accurate — is that where this space is now? Is it almost like phones, just a bigger camera, or are there still paradigm-shifting changes to come?", "That is such a wonderful question. I’m glad you asked me that. I think, based on the performance of our sensor, while we are very good there are things we could do better.", "But we’re quite a ways down the path. The things we can make better going forward are very well-known to us; they’re very well-known to our patients.", "You want to eliminate anything that’s an outlier. Our algorithm is designed to pick up outliers and shut them down, but there may be an occasional one where it doesn’t.", "So if you could eliminate the big negative experience that’s a good thing.", "Certainly, improving experience within various ranges and on various days — these [challenges] are small compared to the problems we’re used to solving.", "The G7 is a very small physical footprint, I don’t know that we need to go much smaller than that. What’s going to be interesting going forward is this becomes a software and a data thing.", "This becomes about providing the patient with the experience they want.", "So for example, I had somebody in earlier who has two daughters with Type 1 diabetes. His vision of what he wants and what his daughters want is a CGM that connects with pumps, connects with phones, that has all this science and algorithms so his daughters never have to do anything, so they have a fully-automated insulin delivery system.", "Our Tandem Control IQ joint product that came out late last year is a step along that path.", "There are patients who want that and we need to offer a product that will meet those needs nicely. There are others who don’t.", "There are others who are going to want a pen that’s connected to an app and maybe manage that way. ...", "But if we can create an experience whereby we can, in a very thoughtful way, meet the needs of all patients, I don’t think that’s 10 software iterations [away], but I don’t think it’s one either.", "When we talk about paradigm shifts, I have to ask: Is noninvasive a pipe dream?", "With any technology I ask another question first: What does invasive mean? Invasive, the way people define it, means they’re afraid of needles.", "So I want you to think of something. I’m wearing a G7 on my arm right now. Just touch that. Is there anything invasive about that?", "So when they’re solving the invasive problem, they’re not really solving a problem, because a needle puts a sensor in you but that sensor is the width of a hair, it goes in on a very shallow basis, it doesn’t hurt.", "So what are you solving by creating a noninvasive platform unless you get wild accuracy?", "There are three problems to solve in sensors: If you can make it perform better than the other guys, or as good; if you make it more convenient; and if you significantly reduce the cost.", "So if one of those three things happen and you can maintain the other two, you have a product offering.", "I’ve never seen anything on the noninvasive side that meets the performance standards. It may be low cost if you’ve got it reading from your watch, but if it doesn’t achieve performance it doesn’t matter.", "We look at all of them. We’re not blind to them, but we haven’t seen them make a difference. And if one of them did?", "Quite candidly, we’d look real hard at making it part of our product family because we’re not going to give the space up easily.", "I had another question about moving into the Type 2 market — is that a clinically motivated thing or is it more of a business move?", "People with Type 2 diabetes are diagnosed and they’re given a pill and told \"walk more, eat less and take this.\"", "And over time they get worse and worse and worse, and by the time you intervene sometimes it’s even too late.", "You learn more from one sensor session than you ever learn from any of these fingersticks, and when these patients are provided with information they do incredibly well.", "We saw in my presentation yesterday the improvement in the program at UnitedHealth Group, how much better a patient was after going through their program.", "Average glucose values, glucose spikes, everything goes down.", "We saw another pilot from Intermountain Healthcare where they just took a small group of 100 patients — 50 on the CGM full time, 50 on meters.", "They believe the annual cost savings in the CGM was $5,000 a year per patient, based on hospitalizations, lab tests, drug costs, doctor visits, phone calls.", "Look, we’d be disingenuous to say everything isn’t business-motivated, because it is. We’re a company.", "But we look at a Type 2 population around the country that’s much larger than the Type 1 population and the interaction with those people is more recommendation, it’s more education, it’s more diagnostic.", "Versus in our Type 1 and our Type 2 intensive insulin populations, it’s fully integrated into drug delivery and dosing a drug.", "Look at the Type 2 drugs that are out. Next time you go home and watch television, there are more ads for Type 2 diabetes drugs than any drug out on the market.", "They spend a fortune on Type 2 diabetes drug advertising — Novo, Lilly, Novartis, everybody. Their Type 2 drugs are everywhere because this condition is so rampant and people are afraid of getting on insulin, but we don’t know when the right time to put a patient on insulin is.", "Well, you learn that by putting on a CGM [and tracking their condition]. When the drugs don’t work anymore, it’s time to make a change.", "Or if they don’t work anymore because you’re eating horribly or you’re not exercising, you need to try this or we’re going to move you to insulin.", "So there’s a diagnostic element here, but there’s also an element where the patients just do better. It becomes a question of getting reimbursement and getting a product and a payment [model] whereby payers will pay for it.", "We have found in all of our experiences all over the world that when our product is reimbursed we do fabulously well.", "Unless it’s extremely inexpensive, cash pay to have a consistent market is hard. So we’ve got to develop our dataset and we’ll continue to work with all of these companies, with the insurance companies, with Onduo, with Livongo.", "We’ve got multiple irons in the fire and we’ll figure it out. For us the important thing is that they all wear Dexcom sensors.", "We haven’t talked much about all the things we accoplished last year. $1.47 billion off a billion-dollar year.", "That type of organic growth you just don’t see.

improvements in A1c in the DCCT came at the expense of increased rates of severe hypoglycemia (4).", "Importantly, regular use of CGMs with ≥ 6 days of wear per week is essential for attaining these improved clinical outcomes (97, 99).", "Early studies using less accurate CGMs suggested that continuous glucose monitoring had minimal positive impact on quality of life (QoL) and, possibly, even a negative impact attributable to sleep disruption and an increased need to support those providing childcare (98, 100).", "However, Mauras et al. studied use of CGMs in children aged 4 to <10 years and found that CGM use is associated with increased parental satisfaction and feelings of safety (101).", "Randomized controlled trials of adults with T1D have shown that use of newer CGM devices positively impacts QoL by reducing diabetes distress, increasing confidence to detect hypoglycemia, and decreasing diabetes management related interpersonal tension with family and friends (102).", "A recently published study of a pediatric population similarly showed reduced fear of hypoglycemia, improved diabetes treatment satisfaction, and improved parental sleep quality (103).", "Physical discomfort, body image concerns, the need to be connected to the device at all times, frequent alarms that disrupt daily life, and the expense of the technology are all frequently cited patient concerns regarding CGM use (44, 104–107).", "Parents of young children with T1D indicate that they would like to receive targeted formal education to improve their knowledge of these technologies,

supplemented with adhesive patches and tape over top of the CGM sensor.", "Skin integrity is also a significant concern, particularly for people with sensitive skin and those who also use an insulin pump (111).", "Although there is little evidence-based research to guide recommendations for preserving skin integrity, current literature recommends: rotating sites to give previously used sites time to heal completely before a new sensor is inserted, and using a barrier solution or dressing (e.g., Tegaderm™) between the skin and the sensor adhesive to minimize contact and irritation.", "Table 9

serve as a receiver.", "Others are seeking to develop devices that combine insulin infusion cannulas with CGM sensors into a single device.", "Current product labeling prohibits insulin delivery at the CGM sensor site and recent studies have identified insulin preservatives as the major cause of CGM inaccuracy when these devices are in close proximity (112).", "While understanding current

Shares of smaller pump maker Tandem Diabetes Care immediately dropped 20% when news of the deal became public.1", "Such predictions, however, may prove overly dramatic. The past 16 months have seen Medtronic sign an outcomes-based payment agreement with another insurer, but no insurer has followed UHC’s lead and signed exclusivity pacts with Medtronic or any other pump maker.", "If UHC patients are protesting the policy, they have been less visible in recent months. The exclusivity deal helped inspire a campaign by JDRF (formerly the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation),2 but the early media coverage has waned.", "As for the deal’s impact on UHC patients, outsiders are forced to guess. UHC has declined to disclose any figures related to the policy: how many of its policyholders use insulin pumps, what pumps they chose before the transition, or how many have switched to Medtronic after preferred pumps broke or were out of warranty.", "An estimated 1.25 million3 (0.4%) of the nation’s 325 million people4 have type 1 diabetes (T1D). Estimates of the percentage of American patients with T1D who use a pump vary, but the JDRF currently reports the figure at 40%.5 Roughly 75% of all pump users have a Medtronic pump.", "The vast majority have T1D, although a very small number have type 2 diabetes.6", "Still, it’s hard to get a precise handle on the number of patients affected by the UHC decision, since the policy excludes Medicare Advantage patients, those younger than 18, and enrollees of UHC Sierra Life and Life Commercial.7 Based on UHC’s combined commercial and Medicaid population of 36.5 million, the number of people who might be asked to switch pumps is likely between 10,000 and 12,000.8", "Eventually, nearly all adult Medicaid and commercial UHC patients who refuse to buy other pump brands out-of-pocket will have to switch, either to a Medtronic pump or to insulin injections.", "Those who used their benefits to buy a non-Medtronic pump before the policy took effect can still get coverage for supplies so long as the pump keeps working and remains under warranty.", "Warranties typically last 4 years, so the transition probably has yet to affect more than one-third of UHC patients who prefer non-Medtronic pumps.", "Such numbers only tell part of the story. It is impossible to know the strength of patient preferences overall and for individual patients.", "Michele Hynes, who is covered by UHC, switched from Medtronic to Animas more than 4 years ago because the Animas pump was waterproof (as some Medtronic models now are) and because it had a remote control.", "“As a woman, I often don’t have access to pockets if I am wearing a skirt or dress. As such, in these cases, I generally clip my pump to my bra.", "It is SO convenient to be able to dose from my meter and not have to leave the table or grab my pump out of my bra,” she wrote to Evidence-Based Diabetes Management™ (EBDM™) in an email.", "An even bigger deal for Hynes is the sensor. The 41-year-old mother of 2 young children wants an integrated system that automatically delivers insulin based on readings from a continuous glucose monitor (CGM), but she wants a system that works with a Dexcom sensor.", "If she moved to a Medtronic pump, the only way to automate delivery would be to move to a Medtronic sensor as well.", "“In general, I have found that anyone who has used Dexcom is less than impressed with Medtronic sensors.", "And as such, I am hesitant to switch—to the point I am still using an out-of-warranty Animas pump,” she wrote.", "“I will probably concede defeat and order a new pump in the next 2 months.”", "Looking beyond patient preferences, the other important metrics for evaluating the policy are, obviously, health outcomes, total cost savings, and how any savings are distributed among UHC, premium payers, and pump-using patients.", "“Patient safety, service, and cost were key considerations in our decision-making process to partner with Medtronic,” wrote UHC spokeswoman Kristen A. Hellmer in an emailed response to EBDM™ to requests for specific numbers.", "“We have finalized a value-based agreement, which rewards improved outcomes for UnitedHealthcare members on insulin pumps and places greater focus on quality rather than the volume of care delivered.”", "Some observers have argued that patients might suffer worse outcomes after being pushed away from first-choice machines and toward devices they found less intuitive or less suited to their needs,9 but there’s no trial data connecting current Medtronic pumps to inferior outcomes.", "There is, on the other hand, solid evidence tying Medtronic’s most advanced pump system to superior outcomes.", "Medtronic’s MiniMed 670G, the first system to receive the FDA designation of “artificial pancreas,”10 became available to US patients in June.", "It combines a pump with a CGM and software to automate many dosing decisions. Even in manual mode, it automatically suspends insulin delivery when blood glucose levels fall dangerously low (and resume it when they rise).", "In auto mode, the system uses CGM readings to adjust insulin delivery levels every 60 seconds. It’s nowhere near perfect, but trial data strongly suggest that the automation—which is unique to Medtronic’s system—significantly improves outcomes.", "Among 124 patients in a 3-month trial, auto mode reduced the following: average glycated hemoglobin (A1C) from 7.4% to 6.9%, dangerous hypoglycemia by 40%, and reduced time spent with excessive blood glucose by 11%.11", "“Although we are in favor of more, rather than less, patient choice, there’s good reason to believe that this UnitedHealthcare policy doesn’t change that much negatively.", "It’s likely that most UnitedHealthcare pumpers already use Medtronic, that those pumpers will be among the earlier ones to upgrade, and that outcomes will be as good or better with most that are in line to shift from another brand.", "Medtronic has shown that this product will improve outcomes, that’s what matters to payers in this era of value-based healthcare, and there’s good reason to think that UHC’s policy will deliver on outcomes,” said diaTribe Foundation founder Kelly L. Close, who advised patients who don’t want Medtronic to raise their voices, especially on social media.", "“Assuming it’s true that Medtronic systems improve outcomes, the question would then become, which is more important: patient choice or better outcomes?", "The math would say better outcomes, but I also doubt that deep down, Medtronic or UnitedHealthcare wants this controversy,” Close said in an interview.", "There is no definitive proof that the 670G produces superior results in real-world settings.", "Obviously, Medtronic has not had time to complete a postmarketing study required by the FDA. Until it does, the only indicator of efficacy comes via anecdotes from early adopters and testers, which have generally been positive.", "Close spends much of her time talking to people about medical devices for T1D, and she says she rarely hears a negative review from anyone who has lived with the 670G. Even the people who are nervous about surrendering dosing control to an algorithm, people who are predisposed to be cautious about turning control over to a system, or even to dislike the system, usually end up telling her that it doses them better than they can dose themselves.", "Medtronic, moreover, appears confident that the 670G will improve real-world outcomes and save money for payers.", "In June, Medtronic announced a deal with Aetna that ties payment rates for its systems to the results those systems produce in patients who switch over from insulin injections.12 The companies declined to disclose the financial details of the deal, but Medtronic said that the achievement of A1C targets will be the first metric used to determine payments.", "Other metrics, such as reductions of hypoglycemic episodes, could be added later.13", "“This agreement is an important first step as we look to broadening our partnership to facilitate patient access to the most advanced diabetes management solutions across the care continuum that not only ensure outcomes, but lower the overall cost of care for this chronic and burdensome disease,” said Suzanne Winter, vice president of the company’s Americas Diabetes Group, in the press release that announced the deal.14", "“We recognize the important role that health plans make in coverage, affordability, and choice for type 1 diabetes therapies,” wrote JDRF spokesman Christopher Rucas in an email about the group’s opposition to exclusivity deals.", "“We have put together a campaign we’re calling Coverage2Control, which will call on insurance companies to provide members with diabetes 3 things to give them control.”", "1. Predictable and reasonable out-of-pocket costs for insulin and diabetes management tools.", "2. Freedom to choose an insulin pump that makes sense for the individual, which means no exclusive agreements with pump makers that limit choice.", "3. Coverage of all life-saving devices, including artificial pancreas technology.", "Rucas said the JDRF is “engaging directly with health plans, but also wants to provide the T1D community with opportunities to take action.”", "The JDRF and other patient advocates believe that widespread coverage for all FDA-approved pumps benefits patients not only by letting them choose whatever current machine works best for them, but also by spreading revenue enough to encourage competition and innovation.", "There is a widespread belief among both patient advocates and financial analysts that at least 1 smaller player, possibly more, could soon drop out of the market.", "Tandem Diabetes Care lost nearly $24 million in the first quarter of 2017 as pump shipments fell 30% to 2816.15", "The company lost more than $83 million in 2016 and more than $72 million in 2015.16 Johnson & Johnson has said it is considering selling its diabetes care business, including Animas, a pump-making subsidiary that’s based in suburban", "Philadelphia.17 This comes after the Animas deal won FDA approval in December 2016 for the OneTouch Vibe insulin pump, the first to integrate with the Dexcom G5 CGM.18 Also in the mix is Insulet, which has struggled to convince Medicare to offer reimbursement for its tubeless Omnipod pump.19 And in August, the remaining patients using pumps from Roche Diabetes Care were turned over to Medtronic for ongoing support after Roche announced plans to stop selling its Accu-Chek pumps in the United States.20", "Such a situation would not be historically unique. The number of pump makers has waxed and waned considerably over the past 40 years.", "New entrants have kept coming in with new technology, trying to dethrone MiniMed, the dominant player purchased by Medtronic for $3.7 billion in 2001.21", "None have succeeded, but their efforts have helped fuel a steady improvement in pump technology. Pumps have gotten considerably smaller, more discrete, smarter, easier to use, and more reliable since they first appeared in the 1970s.22 There is reason to believe that more players will enter the market with new ideas.", "For example, Bigfoot Biomedical is performing clinical trials on a system that includes a pump that has no controls on its body because it is controlled through a smart phone app.23", "Even if fewer new companies enter the market and the pace of traditional pump development slows, patients will see differences.", "Today’s models are good enough that observers like Close see little need for dramatic hardware improvement, regardless of how competitive the pump market is.", "Mechanical improvement will continue, she thinks, but more of the value will come from the brains of the pump.", "“Insulin is an incredibly dangerous drug, and a machine will always figure out dosing better than patients or parents or partners.", "Automation is where we’re going, and it’s all about the algorithms and who can make the easiest-to-use systems—take away steps, make things easier to use and smarter.", "That could come from the largest pump manufacturer, but it doesn’t necessarily have to. It can come from another company or academic or even hobbyist who wants to write it,” said Close, who gave the interview while testing a system that used software written by 1 individual to control her insulin.", "“I can’t wait to try the 670G, and I can’t wait until it’s widely available. For now, having a smart algorithm in a box that costs $126 and keeps me between 80 and 120 all night every night is pretty excellent.", "Medtronic raised the bar with its new pump and the outcomes that they have proven (mainly less hypoglcyemia)—and they shouldn’t, and won’t, take their eye off the ball because the field will keep raising the bar ever higher.”", "1.

Yet, in this group with relatively low HbA1c levels (HbA1c 6.35% CGM group vs 6.53% Control group at 34 weeks gestation, p = 0.0372), these benefits seem to be derived from an increase in the time in the target glucose range and a decrease in post-prandial hyperglycemia [10], highlighting that HbA1c alone may not be the best measure of optimal gestational glucose control.", "It is likely that the CGM data guided insulin therapy, particularly doses applicable to prandial insulin delivery, which lead to the higher time spent in the pregnancy target glucose range.", "Moreover, the CGM’s ability to help individuals identify glucose trends and receive alerts for hyperglycemia and hypoglycemia before doing a scheduled point-of-care glucose check decreases glucose variability [11, 12], which may ultimately affect outcomes.", "Remote monitoring of glucose data has the potential to improve health outcomes during pregnancy.

The same device was used in both CGM groups, the rates of CGM use were high, well-validated measures of fear of hypoglycemia were collected prospectively in the CGM groups, and followers for both CGM groups were surveyed monthly.", "Our study was limited in that the data from the no CGM group were retrospective, as a pilot study the numbers of participants in the prospective groups were small, there were no baseline CGM data prior to group assignments, and it was not randomized because providing compatible devices for remote data viewing to all CGM Share users was cost prohibitive and thus they were self-selected.", "It’s possible that the characteristics associated with device compatibility at baseline (such as financial access) are themselves associated with changes in health behaviors and outcomes.", "Pregnancy is a time when women with diabetes are often more vigilant about optimizing glucose management, engaging in good diabetes self-care behaviors, and motivated to improve health outcomes.", "However, they often concomitantly experience increased stress, emotional burden, and hypoglycemic events in their attempts to improve diabetes control.", "Remote monitoring may enhance engagement opportunities for their loved ones and supporters to assist them throughout gestation.", "These preliminary, pilot data show promise for a potential role of CGM therapy with remote monitoring to improve clinical care in pregnant women with T1D through a broader support system for women involving family/friends.", "The results from this study should be considered with caution as the stratification to study group assignment did yield groups that were inherently different at baseline, which could affect the outcome measures.", "More studies, especially randomized controlled trials, are needed to corroborate these findings and describe how remote monitoring may affect maternal glycemic control.", "S1 Data.

higher rate of volume overload, compared with patients with preserved renal function.", "In addition, patients with ESRD had higher healthcare resource utilization, including longer LOS and hospitalization costs compared with patients with DKA and preserved renal function.", "Diabetes is a leading cause of ESRD, with about half of patients requiring dialysis having a diagnosis of diabetes.1–3 There is limited high-quality evidence on the management and outcomes of DKA in patients with ESRD.10 The poor clinical outcome observed in these patients highlights the need for close metabolic monitoring and intensified treatment regimens to prevent the development of DKA, as well as the need for prospective studies to assess personalized management algorithms—including volume replacement and insulin therapy—to improve treatment-related complications and reduce healthcare costs in this high-risk population.", "The mainstay of DKA management in patients with type 1 and type 2 diabetes includes the administration of intravenous fluids, insulin and electrolyte replacement therapy.11 For patients without cardiac or renal compromise, current guidelines recommend infusing isotonic saline at a rate of 15–20 mL/kg or 1–1.5 L during the first hour, with subsequent rate of 250–500 mL/hour.11 The higher rates of complications observed in our study suggest that treatment recommendations included in societies’ guidelines11 may not be applicable to patients with ESRD.", "First, we observed higher rates of volume overload suggesting that current recommendations for intravenous fluids resuscitation in DKA guidelines result in higher rates of fluid overload in the dialysis population.", "The main mechanism for the profound fluid and electrolyte depletion in DKA is osmotic diuresis, which is not present in dialysis patients with ESRD, increasing the risk of volume overload and pulmonary edema.13 Tzamaloukas et al 14 reported that the degree of hypertonicity and intracellular volume contraction is less profound in patients with ESRD compared with patients with normal renal function at similar hyperglycemia levels.", "We suggest a modified approach for fluid replacement in patients with ESRD, preferring a small bolus of 250 mL initially with reassessment after each infusion—particularly if no hypotensive, or just insulin therapy without fluids bolus.13 Intensive fluid resuscitation during the initial management of DKA usually results in some degree of correction of hyperglycemia due to forced osmotic diuresis.", "However, hypertonicity in these patients is more a reflection of the degree of hyperglycemia and not due to osmotic diuresis, as previously discussed.13 It has been proposed that adequate insulin administration alone, with limited or without intravenous fluid resuscitation, may resolve the metabolic disturbances without complications.13 Current guidelines recommend an insulin infusion with a glucose correction rate of 50–75 mg/dL/hour.", "Using continuous glucose monitoring on patients with diabetes, Kazempour-Ardebili et al 15 showed lower mean glucose levels by −36 to −190 mg/dL during dialysis days compared with days off dialysis; and Sobngwi et al 16 showed that total daily insulin needs can decrease by ~25% on hemodialysis days.", "Hence, we suggest a careful and slower rate of hyperglycemia correction, considering the glucose-lowering effect of dialysis and/or potentially avoiding the use of intravenous insulin bolus on starting the insulin infusion, which may decrease the risk of hypoglycemia.", "However, future studies are needed to determine the best hydration regimen to manage patients with DKA and ESRD to minimize iatrogenic fluid overload.", "Potassium concentration is maintained in the body by balancing the intake with the excretion and the transcellular shifts of potassium.", "Approximately 75% of patients admitted with DKA present with elevated serum potassium levels on admission owing to the shift of intracellular potassium to the extracellular compartment in the setting of hypertonicity, insulin deficiency and acidosis.5 17 As expected, patients with ESRD in this study presented with higher potassium levels due to diminished potassium excretion by the kidneys.17 18", "During insulin treatment, potassium concentration rapidly decreases due to intracellular shifting of potassium, mediated by insulin stimulation of Na+-H+ transporter, promoting the entry of Na+, then activation of the Na+-K+ ATPase, resulting in influx of potassium19; as well as increased kaliuresis, thought to be mediated by an aldosterone-like effect of insulin.20 In recent studies in patients with ESRD, the prevalence of hyperkalemia ≥5 mmol/L was reported between 14% and 20%, and the prevalence of hypokalemia ≤4 mmol/L was between 12% and 18%,17 with both conditions associated with increased mortality.21 Patients with DKA and ESRD presented with higher potassium concentration compared with patients with preserved renal function.", "In agreement with previous reports, insulin administration was the only treatment required for correction of hyperkalemia.18 21 Of interest, we observed no differences in the rate of hypokalemia between groups.", "These results indicate the need for a modified potassium administration approach in the management of DKA in patients with ESRD, as well as close follow-up of potassium levels on admission and during insulin treatment.", "We acknowledge several limitations in our analysis including a relatively small number of patients with ESRD presenting with DKA; however, this is the largest cohort study of patients with ESRD admitted with DKA—an uncommon scenario.10 The retrospective nature of the study and the use of ICD-9 codes may limit the ability to accurately differentiate between type 1 and type 2 diabetes, duration of diabetes and precipitant causes.", "Nonetheless, despite using ICD-9/10 codes, we were able to confirm all cases of DKA and ESRD based on biochemical data on admission, which have been a limitation of previous reports.", "In addition, although a DKA treatment protocol is available for use in the emergency department and in intensive care unit and step-down units, the current protocols are not designed to adjust for changes in insulin, fluid and electrolyte administration in patients with diabetes and ESRD on hemodialysis.", "We also recognized the limited value of HbA1c in the setting of ESRD.", "In conclusion, we report significant metabolic and clinical outcome differences between patients with DKA and ESRD compared with patients with preserved renal function.", "Patients with DKA and ESRD on hemodialysis have higher rates of complications, increased resource utilization and hospitalization costs than patients with DKA and preserved renal function.", "We observed a greater number of patients with DKA and ESRD developing volume overload and hypoglycemia during insulin treatment compared with patients with preserved renal function.", "These results indicate that a personalized and careful approach to insulin and fluid replacement and correction of hyperglycemia is needed to improve outcome and prevent iatrogenic complications, volume overload and hypoglycemia.", "Presented at: Part of this study was presented at the 78th Scientific Sessions of the American Diabetes Association,

Or that it appears to be exploring insurance?", "In this analysis, we dive deep into how Google is pushing healthcare forward with a focus on data and AI, including:", "- The specific disease areas where Google is studying diagnostics and management — including diabetes, Parkinson’s Disease, and heart disease, among others", "- How Google is rebuilding the healthcare data infrastructure layer to potentially become the new data pipes for health giants", "- Possible areas of expansion, including hardware for providers, insurance and more", "- How Google could make eventually money off its many disparate healthcare bets", "- Obstacles between where the company is today and where it’s trying to go", "Note: For simplicity we use “Google” as shorthand for the larger Alphabet company, under which many of these healthcare initiatives fall.", "- How Google is using AI to tackle specific diseases", "- Powering the healthcare data infrastructure layer", "As Google enters healthcare, it’s leaning heavily on its expertise in AI. Health data is getting digitized and structured, from a new electronic record standard to imaging to DNA sequencing.", "Google is both helping speed up this process by creating new means of ingesting health data and betting that it can use AI to make sense of the data quickly and potentially more accurately than current methods.", "Among the big 5 tech giants (Facebook, Apple, Microsoft, Google, Amazon), Google emphasizes its progress on machine learning much more than the rest.", "As software, and more specifically artificial intelligence, becomes a differentiating factor in the healthcare space, Google is well-positioned.", "The company is doubling down on the number of research papers it publishes, opening more AI research centers around the world, and developing its own chips and hardware dedicated to running AI/ML processes.", "In addition, Google is the most active investor/ acquirer of AI companies among big tech companies, scooping up talent and building relationships with up-and-coming AI applications.", "In 2015 Google restructured into Alphabet, and AI become the centerpiece of nearly each division’s strategy.", "In that restructuring, healthcare projects, which previously had fallen within the R&D labs of Google X (Google’s secretive special projects lab), instead moved to new subsidiaries at the company.", "To an extent, this restructuring siloed Google’s health initiatives a bit more — but also pushed them beyond the “moonshot” arena into specific subsidiaries with a tighter set of mandates.", "The three subsidiaries focused in healthcare are Verily, DeepMind, and Calico.", "Verily — Verily is where Alphabet is doing the bulk of its healthcare work. The subsidiary is focused on using data to improve healthcare via analytics tools, interventions, research, and more.", "Verily is run by Andrew Conrad, who co-founded the National Genetics Institute. The subsidiary has largely focused on partnering with existing healthcare institutions to find areas to apply AI, especially via its Study Watch, a wearable device that captures biometric data.", "The Study Watch, which is currently awaiting FD approval, has become a centerpiece of a number of research initiatives discussed below.", "The company has recently increased its exposure to startups by setting up a lab space to work beside startups like Freenome and Culture Robotics.", "Verily has also said it’s looking into international expansion via an $800M investment from Singapore sovereign wealth fund Temasek Holdings and investing as a limited partner into Europe-based Medixci Ventures.", "DeepMind — DeepMind is dedicated to artificial intelligence research. One of its main initiatives is finding ways AI can be applied to healthcare.", "DeepMind was acquired by Google for $500M+ and is run by Demis Hassabis. The company is based in London and works closely with National Health Service institutions.", "Calico — Calico focuses on learning about and then combating aging and age-related diseases. The subsidiary uses AI to make sense of large datasets as well as to automate certain lab processes.", "Google has also invested heavily into the healthcare space through its venture arm GV:", "GV — The venture arm invests across different sectors, but has been increasing its investing pace in healthcare companies, while its overall investing pace has slowed.", "Below, we’ll largely focus on healthcare initiatives at each of these subsidiaries, but will also discuss how other Google assets — such as Google Cloud, which sits outside of these key organizations — are being leveraged for healthcare.", "Using AI to tackle disease, from monitoring, to detection, to lifestyle management", "Google’s strategy involves an end-to-end approach to healthcare, including:", "- Data generation — This includes digitizing and ingesting data produced by wearables, imaging, and MRIs among other methods.", "This data stream is critical to AI-driven anomaly detection.", "- Disease detection — Using AI to detect anomalies in a given dataset that might signal the presence of some disease.", "- Disease/lifestyle management — These tools help people who have been diagnosed with a disease or are at risk of developing one go about their day-to-day lives and/or make positive lifestyle modifications.", "While most of these projects fall under Verily’s purview, DeepMind is involved in several parts of disease detection and Google itself holds several patents under the parent company.", "These are currently the main diseases Google is tackling with this approach. As shown below, work on these disease spans organizations under the Alphabet structure.", "Verily is working on detecting diabetic retinopathy (a condition when high sugar levels cause damage to blood vessel in the eye) via a partnership with Nikon’s subsidiary Optos, which makes the machines for retinal imaging tests and eye disease detection.", "In earlier research, Google proved its algorithms were equally as good as trained ophthalmologists in detecting the condition.", "The DeepMind division is also working with the Moorfields Eye Hospital in the UK to improve on this prior eye disease research and assist eye doctors in assessing the risk of a patient’s eye problem and directing them to medical care based on the urgency of the condition.", "In the current system, all anomalies are treated as urgent, even though there is a spectrum of severity.", "Verily isn’t only focused on detecting eye diseases, but also on potentially fixing certain diseases as well.", "Analyzing the frequency of words in Verily’s granted patents reveals it has consistently filed patents related to contacts and eye implants.", "Several of Verily’s patents highlight ways to combat presbyopia (age-related eyesight degeneration) by using contact lenses to help focus vision.", "This is a project Verily is working on in conjunction with Alcon, a subsidiary of Novartis, though the project appears to have delayed its trials and its current status is unclear.", "Diabetes detection and management is a major healthcare focus for Google, which has already had some success rolling out products.", "Given the prevalence of diabetes — the condition affects 30 million people in the US alone — it makes sense that this would be an area of attention.", "In addition to combating presbyopia, the Alcon contact was also meant to monitor glucose through tears, and was one of Verily’s first “moonshots” to be publicly announced.", "However, other experts have suggested that tears are not a reliable source for monitoring glucose.", "Google’s smaller continuous glucose monitor (CGM), which Verily created with medical device company Dexcom, is already farther into the commercialization pipeline.", "The Dexcom G6 monitoring system, which has been submitted to the FDA for approval, monitors levels of interstitial glucose right under your skin.", "The long-term goal is to create an even smaller disposable sensor that can be worn for 14 days like a bandage and requires no finger stick calibrations (as opposed to the current G6, which requires a finger stick calibration once a day).", "This was mentioned in the Dexcom investor presentation as seen on the left.", "The collaboration with Verily has also seen an increasing number of mentions in Dexcom’s earnings calls over the last couple of years.", "While diabetes management is relatively well understood, there’s a gap in diabetes detection today.", "Because your pancreas is connected to your autonomic nervous system, small changes in heart rhythm could potentially help detect development of the disease.", "Cardiogram, a startup that uses heart rate to monitor and predict disease, recently released a study that used existing wearables, including the Android Wear, to detect diabetes with 85% accuracy using AI and heart rate.", "This kind of detection could be a potential area of expansion for Verily if it looks to improve its early detection of diabetes.", "Verily is also leveraging multiple partnerships in the diabetes space by including the Dexcom monitors in the starter kit for Onduo, its virtual diabetes management program that recently began its commercial launch.", "Onduo is a joint venture between Sanofi and Verily, which have together invested $500M into the solution.", "Using sensors and coaching, the company’s goal is to help type 2 diabetics manage their condition.", "Onduo is similar to other virtual diabetes programs like Omada Health, which combine hardware (glucose monitors, smart scales, etc.), software, and coaching to help people with diabetes manage their condition.", "AI is useful here to detect at-risk patients and streamline the coaching process.", "Google CEO Sundar Pichai mentioned in the Q1’18 earnings call that Onduo began a commercial launch of its diabetes program earlier in the year, likely targeting insurance carriers (based on its website, below) and employers (based on this study working with supermarket employees in the Netherlands).", "Verily also recently patented a smart syringe to help diabetics monitor their injections. The syringe will likely be part of the Onduo solution.", "While Onduo is currently focused on type 2 diabetes, it has mentioned moving into type 1 diabetes management in the future as well.", "Startups making AI-powered medical devices that help manage type 1 diabetes automatically like Bigfoot Biomedical are developing this kind of closed-loop system for type 1 diabetes.", "Bigfoot Biomedical creates an automated insulin dispensing solution by combining a continuous glucose monitor, an insulin infusion pump, and software to optimize insulin delivery automatically.", "This area could be one Verily chooses to move or acquire into.", "Currently Google is approaching data generation and heart condition monitoring in two ways.", "The first is via the Study Watch, produced by Verily and used by researchers to monitor different biomarkers of study participants.", "This includes both an electrocardiogram (ECG) and heart rate monitor, which researchers can use to help detect anomalies earlier and to better understand what other factors might lead to or be precursors to heart episodes.", "This could help in identifying better predictors of heart disease earlier in the development of the condition.", "The second is highlighted in a patent for a passive heart monitor using optical sensors and machine vision that seems more catered towards the everyday person.", "The patent talks about taking images of key blood flow areas to provide a continuous monitoring of heart health in order to promote more healthy behaviors.", "The patent also has a disease detection component, detecting blood flow issues in areas like the brain for stroke detection or detecting cardiac abnormalities like an arrhythmia, which could indicate cardiovascular issues.", "Google is also looking to help providers detect cardiovascular issues via retinal images. The company published a paper on how its machine learning algorithms were able to detect risk for cardiovascular issues by analyzing the blood vessels in the eye.", "Below are fundus images of the eye, with the green lines being the areas that the neural network used to make its predictions.", "To help patients who are at higher risk of developing cardiovascular disease or who already have heart conditions, Verily has participated in a $75M grant to One Brave Idea, a project from Dr. Calum MacRae, chief of cardiovascular medicine at Brigham and Women’s Hospital.", "The project aims to better understand the factors that contribute to different types of heart disease, as well as methods of preventing heart disease and potentially reversing it.", "The grant was given in conjunction with AstraZeneca and the American Heart Association.", "While details on the project are still vague, it’s possible that Verily will eventually move to create a lifestyle management system similar to Onduo for people at risk for heart disease.", "Parkinson’s disease is a debilitating neurological disorder that is poorly understood. Now, Verily is trying to figure out the underlying causes of the disease by capturing and analyzing data to produce earlier disease identification, personalized treatments, and improved management.", "Verily launched the Personalized Parkinson’s Project with Radboud University in the Netherlands to combine clinical data with patient data collected by the Study Watch, including heart functionality, electrodermal activity, and inertial movements.", "One hope is that with 24-hour monitoring researchers will be able to identify indicators of disease onset, such as changes in heart rhythm or sleeping patterns.", "Another hope is that Verily can use data from the project to build algorithms that can segment Parkinson’s patients and hopefully personalize the treatments.", "Through the Personalized Parkinson’s study, Verily developed an encrypted database of deidentified data for researchers to use.", "It’s building a similar database for the NIH called the Knowledge Portal as well, allowing researchers to share and visualize datasets related to Parkinson’s research.", "Through this work, Verily and researchers hope to find earlier indications of the onset of the disease, understand how it progresses, and potentially find new ways to create therapies for people with the disease.", "In the meantime, Verily is also looking at ways to help Parkinson’s patients manage their day-to-day lives.", "This began with the acquisition of Lift Labs, creator of the Liftware spoon that helps Parkinson’s patients stabilize their food while eating.", "The spoon and related attachmentsa are sold for $195 and up.", "According to patents it’s filed, Verily is exploring other ways to use the Liftware tool to help people with neurological disorders.", "For example, this patent suggests the spoon can be used to detect the mass of food and number of bites taken per meal to ensure that patients are getting adequate nutrition.", "This is useful information for caregivers and providers that are helping manage patients with neurological disorders.", "Multiple sclerosis is also a disease without a known cause or cure. MS is the result of the immune system attacking the myelin sheath in the brain, causing deterioration of muscle control, memory loss, and more.", "Verily is working with biotech company Biogen and Brigham and Women’s Hospital to set up a longitudinal study to understand how the disease develops.", "This combines data from participants wearing the Study Watch with clinical data fed into Verily’s machine learning algorithms to improve detection and understand what causes the disease to progress and flare up.", "Verily hasn’t explicitly talked about management of the disease. However, there’s been exploratory research into using electroceuticals to combat MS, which could inform a project Verily is pursuing with GlaxoSmithKline called Galvani Bioelectronics.", "The project uses miniature electronics to control how electrical signals flow throughout the body. Electroceuticals are very small electronic implants that help modulate the flow of electrical signals through the nervous system.", "It’s possible that Galvani’s bioelectronics could be used to help manage MS as it progresses. Notably, Verily has a job posting for neuromodulation, suggesting it will explore the area.", "In addition, Google could eventually help people manage the disease by creating external solutions that help people with impaired motor functions.", "Exoskeleton companies like ReWalk Robotics help people with impaired motor function stay mobile by combining software, sensors, and electronics.", "To see the rest of the report, including how Google is building a new healthcare data infrastructure, it's possible expansion areas, and obstacles it might face, read the full report.", "6y2014....
