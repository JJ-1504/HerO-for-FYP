Crane -- President And Chief Executive Officer", "Thanks, Dan, and thanks to everybody that's joined today. I'll first start off with the first quarter results.", "We had a strong quarter even with one of the warmest winters we've seen in a long time. The GAAP basis earned $0.60 per share.", "Non-GAAP basis earned $0.87 per share. Joe is going to cover all those details in his remark.", "We had very solid operations throughout the first quarter, first quartile outage frequency and duration and record-setting nuclear refueling outages that I'll go into further as we continue.", "Hearings and working groups in Illinois on Clean Energy legislation are which is very critical right now, are meeting.", "The discussions going on. We still haven't determined how the legislature will get back into session to resume work, but I think they all understand the priority of what needs to be done, not only for energy, but the capital budgets and other issues in Illinois.", "So we'll work and continue to work on that through May.", "Our number one focus throughout this pandemic has been focusing on the safety and well-being of our employees.", "Our employees are on a mission. They know we're mission-critical in as many as possible working remotely in supporting the critical infrastructure.", "We have approximately 17,000 people, employees and another 8,000 contractors working remotely and being able to execute on their tasks without any faults.", "So our frontline workers, the 17,000 frontline workers and the contractors that are maintaining the electric gas system in the power plants.", "We're protecting with PPE, social distancing and prescreening.

We fully we give full pay to employees that are being quarantined.", "If they've become in contact through our tracing mechanisms that we're providing at all of our facilities, we quarantine them for the required amount of time, which allows us to keep not only them and their families safe, but also other employees.", "We also expanded access to backup care for dependence. So those frontline employees are supporting frontline employees that need to be in the workspace out in the field do not have to worry about their children out of school or their elderly parents.", "So that's another service we're providing to the employees to keep everybody focused on their own safety, the job one, keeping the grid up and keeping the gas flowing and keeping the power plants running.", "A big part on slide four, you'll see a big part of what we do, what we've always been doing and what we will continue to do is support our customers and communities.", "As you know, and you've heard, all the utilities suspended disconnects, waived new late fees, and we did reconnect or reach out to customers that had been disconnected since the 1st of March and offered to reconnect those individuals who had been disconnected.", "And this gives us the ability to for people that are laid off or people that are in financially challenged times to have one of the most critical social and needed energy sources that we can provide.", "We also, at the Exelon Foundation and our companies, have contributed over more than $5.9 million to relief organizations, ensuring food banks and other programs can be supported during this time of need, and we'll continue to focus on that.", "But at the core of everything, after safety in the community, is our operational excellence, which is even more critical right now, keeping the lights on in this crisis, keeping the hospitals with power, healthcare providers, grocery stores, medical food production facilities, you can see the list of the priorities that are there.", "And we have to, as a company and an organization, continue to have reliable service, and that is strong at the utilities.", "We've had spring storms already this year.

We've completed 26 maintenance outages at our power facilities readying for summer readiness, and all done without issues.", "So with that, that's the overall view of the operations and what we're focused on, and I'll turn it over to Joe to go through the financial.", "Joseph Nigro -- Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Thank you, Chris, and good morning, everyone. Today, I'll cover our first quarter results and our updated full year guidance, including the financial impacts of COVID-19 and sensitivities for the remainder of the year.", "Starting with slide 10. We earned $0.60 per share on a GAAP basis and $0.87 per share on a non-GAAP basis, which was slightly below the midpoint of our guidance range.", "We are particularly pleased with the results considering we had one of the warmest winters on record.", "Temperatures in the Mid-Atlantic were five to seven degrees higher than average in January through March, costing us $0.14 per share between Exelon Generation and our non-decoupled utilities.", "This quarter was the most impacted by weather of any quarter since the PHI merger.", "Exelon Utilities delivered $0.55 per share net of holding company expenses. Our non-decoupled utilities, PECO, Delmarva, Delaware and Atlantic City Electric, were impacted by the warm winter weather.", "Across these territories, heating degree days were down 18% to 22% during the quarter. These impacts were partially offset by O&M timing across the utility.", "ExGen was also impacted by weather, earning $0.32 per share in the first quarter. The weather impact on gross margin and unplanned outages at Salem and FitzPatrick were offset by favorable O&M and nuclear decommissioning trust fund gains.", "Turning to slide 11. Efforts to combat the spread of COVID-19, including stay-at-home orders in our states, have caused dramatic changes in electricity demand and the national economic outlook.", "Taking into account the impact of COVID-19, unfavorable weather and lower ROEs at ComEd, we are revising our 2020 full year guidance range from $3 to $3.30 per share to $2.80 to $3.10 per share.", "While typically, we would not change guidance so early in the year, we want to provide a complete picture of where we stand at this point in the year and include our best estimates of the COVID-19 impact.", "Let me start by saying that none of us has ever experienced anything like this before. The full impacts, including the duration and structural changes to the economy continue to evolve.", "In developing our revised guidance range, we looked at the load and economic data we were seeing in April, talked to our customers about their expectations for the year and considered different economic outlooks.", "In Q2, we expect commercial industrial load to decrease by 9% to 15% and residential load to increase by 4% to 7% depending on the region.", "Over the remainder of the year, we expect commercial industrial unfavorability and residential favorability to diminish as the economy recovers.", "We've taken a cautious view of the world, and you can see the assumptions on this slide that underpin our new guidance range.", "We also recognize that the situation is changing rapidly, so we show a number of sensitivities to our guidance on the following pages so you can calibrate.", "I also want to come back to a point on actions we are taking. We challenged the organization against the current backdrop, identifying and pursuing initiatives across the company to lower our costs and improve our profitability.", "These provide $250 million of offset to other pressures, which we reflect in this updated forecast.", "At the utilities, the $0.10 per share degradation from prior guidance can be split into a little over $0.05 for lower distribution ROEs at ComEd due to the drop in the 30-year treasury and a little less than $0.05 for the record mild first quarter weather.", "For COVID-19-related impacts, we expect to be able to offset the impact of lower loads at our non-decoupled utilities through cost reductions and the assumption that our regulators allow for timely recovery of expected bad higher bad debt.", "At ExGen, the $0.10 per share degradation reflects $0.05 of drag from the very mild Q1 weather and then $0.05 of COVID-19 impacts on load net of our cost and business initiatives.", "In addition to the O&M savings, we remain focused on cash at ExGen and have lowered capex by $125 million in 2020.", "We expect our earnings to be most impacted in the second quarter and have provided adjusted operating earnings guidance of $0.35 to $0.45 per share.", "Looking at the impact of COVID-19 on the utilities on slide 12. As you can see, 70% of the Exelon Utilities are decoupled, and the revenues are not subject to load fluctuations.", "The majority of volumes at our nondecoupled utilities, PECO, Atlantic City Electric and Delmarva, Delaware, are commercial industrial customers.", "In the table at the bottom right, we provide sensitivities for load by customer class and ComEd's distribution ROE for the remainder of the year.", "Each of our utilities is working with the regulators on COVID-19 cost and bad debt recovery mechanisms where we do not have them.", "Atlantic City Electric and ComEd have existing bad debt mechanisms recovery mechanisms that result in no earnings impact with the cash being recovered in 2021 and 2022, respectively.", "Last month, the PSCs in Maryland and DC issue orders to authorize a regulatory asset that tracks prudent COVID-19-related costs incurred, which will allow for an assessment of recovery of incremental bad debt or atypical costs related to the pandemic.", "We are currently engaged with our commissions and stakeholders in Delaware, New Jersey and Pennsylvania regarding the potential recovery of costs.", "On slide 27 of the appendix, we provide more detail on these efforts and current bad debt recovery mechanisms.", "Turning to slide 13, the impacts of the Constellation business are like those of a non-decoupled utility.", "Constellation delivers around 210 terawatt hours annually of customer load through its wholesale and retail channels.", "In retail, Constellation's 2019 customer breakdown was 90% commercial and industrial. And of those customers, 70% of them were on fixed price contracts.", "When we look at volumes for the rest of the year, and exclude index contracts, we have about 125 terawatt hours of normal annualized load exposed to COVID-related demand destruction.", "For the last nine months of the year, we assume Constellation load is down 6% in total, with C&I down 9% and residential increasing 2%.", "I know there have been questions about how constellation's fixed price load contracts are impacted by COVID-19.", "So let me take a minute to explain. These fixed-price contracts assume that the customer will use a certain amount of electricity and are impacted by fluctuations in customer usage in three ways: first, margin; second, commodity value; and third, through collection of fixed price charges.", "We are seeing the impacts of lower load on these in the current environment. When load is lower, Constellation loses the original sales margin on those unconsumed megawatt hours.", "Customer contracts can become in and out of the money over time. When a forward contract is signed, it assumes a price for electricity over the term of the contract.", "If the power procured for the customer is at a higher price than the current market and then the customer consumes less than forecasted, the generation must be sold into the open market at a lower price, creating a gap in revenues.", "Finally, customers are billed for capacity and transmission charges that are charged by the ISO. Although these are typically fixed charges, for many customers, we unitize them over the expected quantity of electricity and collect them on a dollars-per-megawatt-hour basis.", "So when the customer consumes less, we undercollect the fixed charge due to the ISO and are responsible for the shortfall.", "These fluctuations can be positive or negative to our bottom line. In a normal world where load fluctuations are primarily driven by weather, the risk is priced in and assumed in the contract.", "That assumption of risk could not have predicted the demand shocks and impacts that we're seeing due to the pandemic.", "In 2020, where C&I load is significantly displaced, we are seeing pressure on our gross margin, which is reflected in our guidance.", "We also expect the drop in profits to be limited to the period in time that the pandemic drives very wide differences in actual and assumed usage.", "Looking to the future, the Constellation business will return to profitability levels similar to those under normal conditions.", "And besides this highly unusual situation, having our load be primarily commercial and industrial customers remains key to our strategy.", "First, C&I customer usage patterns align with our baseload generation portfolio as C&I load is much more predictable and stable than residential load.", "In normal circumstances, C&I customer load is less exposed to weather fluctuations due to its higher load factors than residential customers.", "Second, C&I customers allow us to achieve scale that cannot be done with residential customers. Finally, across finally, although the gross margins may be higher on residential customers, these margins do not account for the cost to acquire these customers, which are higher than C&I.", "You can see the impacts of weather and COVID-19 on our gross margin on slide 14. In 2020, total gross margin is down $300 million.", "$100 million is due to Q1 weather, which can be pretty evenly split between lower volumes on our power and gas customer businesses.", "As a reminder, our gas business makes most of its margin in the winter. We then are $200 million lower due to the impacts of COVID-19 on the balance of the year.", "During the quarter, we expect we executed $100 million and $50 million in powered new business and non-powered new business, respectively.", "In 2021, total gross margin's down $100 million, primarily due to lower power prices in PJM in New York as well as some modest carryover of COVID-19-related drag on the load business.", "Since the end of the quarter, we have seen power prices rebound to levels above the start of the year, recovering most of the gross margin decline.", "We also executed $50 million of powered and non-powered new business during the quarter.", "We remain behind our ratable hedging program in both 2020 and 2021. We ended the quarter slightly more behind ratable in 2020 than at year-end at 8% to 11% due to the reduction in load offsetting hedges made during the quarter.", "2021 is 2% to 5% behind ratable. We continue to see some upside in certain markets but are not expecting a significant rebound in power prices or volatility.", "Slide 15 provides our 2020 projected sources and uses of cash. Our free cash flow is down $775 million from our last disclosure.", "The utilities cash flow accounts for $600 million of the degradation, largely due to timing of accounts receivable and bad debt, which we expect to reverse.", "ExGen's free cash flow is down $100 million, reflecting the gross margin decline, but is mitigated by cost reductions and lower capex.", "Our liquidity position is strong. As you know, in March, there were significant disruptions in the commercial paper markets, and we temporarily drew down $1.5 billion on ExGen's $5.3 billion credit facility, which we repaid in early April.", "Given the uncertainty in that market and a $900 million June holding company refinancing, we issued $2 billion in April at Corporate, which gives us additional flexibility.", "We are confident that we have ample liquidity to meet our needs.", "We also remain committed to strong investment-grade credit ratings. Our FFO to debt is projected to fall to 18% and is below our 19% to 21% target, which reflects the combination of lower FFO and higher debt in 2020 due to the pressures I've previously disclosed.", "We expect to see improvement in our FFO in 2021, as some of the cash timing issues at the utilities resolve next year and the impacts from COVID unwind.", "If they were to persist, we have levers we can take to enhance our credit profile. We talked to the rating agencies and their understanding of the current market environment.", "Chris M. Crane -- President And Chief Executive Officer", "Thanks, Joe. The pandemic has brought unexpected challenges to our business in 2020. We have found ways to offset much of the financial impact of this unique challenge, but we're not done.", "We'll continue to look for ways we can increase profitability and cash flow through the next three quarters.", "The impact on the COVID-19 does not change the fact that Exelon's fundamental business is strong and our strategy remains strong.", "Our utility rate base is growing over 7% annually for the next four years. In that time, we will add more than $13 billion in rate base, nearly equivalent to adding a utility the size of ComEd.", "Our utility operations are best-in-class.

Thank you.", "[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Stephen Byrd from Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.", "I wanted to just first talk to well, thanks for the thorough update and disclosure, very helpful. The Illinois legislative process, we're trying to follow this as closely as we can.", "I guess the Illinois Department of Public Health gave some guidance around sort of how the legislature might be able to under what circumstance they could reconvene.", "Do you have a sense for sort of the process and sort of the potential for the legislative session to go through the summer, just given the formal ending date in May, obviously, does not coincide very well with the state's plan to sort of reopen.", "But it does look like there's some potential that the legislature may be able to meet if they meet sort of these health department guidelines.", "What is your sense in terms of the ability of the legislature to meet and do business?", "Chris M. Crane -- President And Chief Executive Officer", "We have seen in other jurisdictions, legislative bodies be able to work through and convene. Kathleen, do you want to talk specifically to the path forward here in Illinois?", "Kathleen L. Barron -- Senior Vice President, Government and Regulatory Affairs and Public Policy", "Sure. And as you know, the stay-at-home order does extend through the end of May. So it is a good sign to see the Department of Public Health guidance to the legislature on how they might bring people back to the capital safely.", "That is good progress, but it just remains to be seen whether the leaders will decide to bring folks back to Springfield this session.", "Even if they cannot come back in May, they can come back in the summer by agreement of the Senate President and the Speaker.", "They could call a session after May 31 or the Governor himself could call a special session under the constitution.", "So we're glad to see that there has been guidance provided. There's just not yet any indication about when exactly they will come back.", "Understood. A lot of uncertainties there. And then just, I guess, in a related matter, in terms of operational decisions for your nuclear plants in Illinois, Chris, you had mentioned a lot of refueling has been completed and quite quickly as well.", "But are there any operational considerations you all would have to make? For example, if legislation is not passed in this, call it, some recession?", "Or do you have some flexibility so that you can give the legislature a bit of time just given, obviously, they have a lot on their plate to address in Illinois?", "Chris M. Crane -- President And Chief Executive Officer", "Yes. It's tough to speculate with everything going on with the COVID, what the outcome of this legislative session or being able to go into an extended session.", "What we've stressed to all the stakeholders is PJM is committed to run the auctions, and their stated time was toward the end of the year.", "And that could be extended. We haven't got any public statement that it was extended that I know of. So we're up against a clock.", "And once those auctions are run, we're highly confident that minimal or any of our clean megawatts will compare in that capacity auction, they'll be replaced by fossil units, which is detrimental to the state's goal of being 100% clean by 2030.", "So the clock is ticking, and I wouldn't speculate on timing of decisions right now, but we're just stressing the importance to the administration and the key legislative stakeholders and others about not only the importance for the nuclear megawatts, but the importance for the renewable megawatts that have been invested in, in the state of Illinois to continue to be able to operate with a profitability that's reasonable.", "So that's where we're at right now. We're continuing the dialogue. Kathleen, Bill Von Hoene are leading the conversations through the state legislators and the stakeholders and we'll continue to push on that.", "Next question comes from the line of Steve Fleishman from Wolfe Research, LLC. Your line is now open.", "Steven Isaac Fleishman -- Wolfe Research -- Analyst", "Just wanted to, I guess, just get a little more color on the comments on the 6% to 8% utility growth rate, and you mentioned you'd be mindful, I think, you said of the Illinois ROE.", "And just can you maybe give a little more color on how to think about it's obvious what you're embedding now for 2020, but how about for the kind of broader growth rate?", "And if rates don't get better, are you still within that range? Or just what you've been assuming in there?", "Chris M. Crane -- President And Chief Executive Officer", "Yes. We have continued to work our five year plan. I think we report out in some places a four year plan.", "Another is a five year plan, but we're continuing on our long-range plan. And it has helped us significantly in customer satisfaction and reliability.", "And it's also allowed us to maintain cash flow and profitability while doing so. In the last three rate cases, we actually gave a rate reduction.", "So as you can imagine, as you would expect, we look at multiple scenarios. And if the economy continues to degrade, impact on customers, whatever it could be is out in the future, the plans can be adjusted.", "But at this time, we don't plan on adjusting. We plan on continuing to do the much-needed reliability and efficiency modifications and prepare the system for the onset of much more distributed and renewable energy coming on.", "It won't be able to happen if we don't make the investments and facilitate it. If we see a day that we're not getting that return or don't see a path to go back, I mean, we haven't seen that day, and we haven't seen that in the near future.", "So we're continuing on with the investment and watching the treasuries and watching the recovery mechanisms.", "Steven Isaac Fleishman -- Wolfe Research -- Analyst", "Okay. So but just to clarify, the if we're in this kind of lower rate environment, I don't know exactly where the whole forward curve of 30-year is, you're still expected to be within the 6% to 8% range?", "Chris M. Crane -- President And Chief Executive Officer", "Joseph Nigro -- Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Steve, we're not changing the target of the 6% to 8%. As Chris said, we're moving forward with the investment that we plan to make.", "We update that target once a year. We also show you sensitivities related to the ComEd ROEs. Obviously, they've dropped some since the 1st of the year, which has an impact.", "We also give you earnings bands that we gave you out through '23, and we're still well within the bands that we gave you.", "And we'll continue to look for ways to challenge ourselves in this regard.", "Chris M. Crane -- President And Chief Executive Officer", "At this point, it would be very shortsighted for us to start, stop, start, stop, depending on an interest rate.", "The most efficient way is to get the long-term investments prudently done and support the customers' needs.", "Steven Isaac Fleishman -- Wolfe Research -- Analyst", "Got it. I see what you're saying. So you're saying, Chris, that you're not going to hold back on investment in the state because of the temporary rates being lower.", "Chris M. Crane -- President And Chief Executive Officer", "Steven Isaac Fleishman -- Wolfe Research -- Analyst", "Okay. Just one other question. Yes. One other question just for I guess for Joe, you mentioned levers on your credit.", "You have levers on your credit profile if, I guess, things stay weaker there. Could you just give some color on what those levers are?", "Joseph Nigro -- Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "I think, Steve, I think we've got a track record of proving that we continue to challenge ourselves on our cost structure.", "I mean, we're reducing our cost by $250 million this year with actions we've taken, and we're going to continue to challenge ourselves in the future in that regard.", "We've been clear that we have some uneconomic power plants, and we're working hard to rectify that. We would have to address that.", "Those would be two big levers that we would have to address.", "Steven Isaac Fleishman -- Wolfe Research -- Analyst", "The next question comes from the line of Shar Pourreza from Guggenheim. Your line is now open.", "Shahriar Pourreza -- Guggenheim Securities -- Analyst", "So a couple of questions here. Realize with Illinois, there is significant uncertainty over '22 with PJM.", "But can you speak a little bit at a high level to how gross margin is developing, maybe just directionally, ignoring the upside or downside from capacity reform?", "And I realize this is secondary at this point to everything going on. But do you still think something can get done in Illinois at the veto session?", "Chris M. Crane -- President And Chief Executive Officer", "We're still working. We still have significant support on what we have to do. Where it gets done, we would hope that it would get done before the end of the session.", "That's what we've stressed to give the IPA time to be able to develop their own auction process. That will allow us to break away on capacity needs for the state of Illinois from PJM.", "It's as I said earlier, it's a very tight time frame. If they were able to come in, in a summer session and we had assurances, they were going to address this in the summer session.", "Under the requirements by the Illinois Health, we would continue to work with them on that. But it's there's a lot of things that they have to get done in Springfield, but they also realize that this is a very important issue to address and along with the state budget and some other large issues.", "So we know there's a will to get to work. It's just the way to get to work and how fast we can get this done.", "Shahriar Pourreza -- Guggenheim Securities -- Analyst", "Got it. And then just what kind of C&I attrition are you guys expecting in your assumptions? And sort of how do we sort of think about Constellation more broadly as we look at 2021 and beyond?", "And does the current situation present any strategic opportunities, in your view, maybe on the retail side?", "Or does sort of some of the reprieves we've been seeing at the state level on the retail side push off any potential acquisition opportunities as you guys look to tighten up that natural hedge?", "Chris M. Crane -- President And Chief Executive Officer", "Jim, do you want to Jim McHugh, do you want to cover that one?", "James McHugh -- Chief Executive Officer , Constellation Executive Vice President", "Sure. Absolutely. I'll answer kind of two parts. I think what we expect from the low decreases we're seeing now is as the states reopen and as things recover, we're seeing about a 15% reduction in that C&I on average in these front-near months.", "By the end of the year, as Joe mentioned on the call, that's more in the probably 4% to 6% range and coming back in through mid next year.", "So from a load perspective, it's temporary, and I think we expect that to bounce back.", "I think from a strategic perspective, a couple of things. We definitely for acquisition space, we'll continue to look for any value of books that come to the market.", "There could be some suppliers that would need to look over their books. We've talked about our strategy before will stay the same, which is we would be looking to buy things, buy books of business that we could easily fit into our platform.", "We've developed, I think, a world-class platform over the years that we can integrate easily, and we've shown that before when we bought books of business.", "And then lastly, I think strategically, it's just product development, where we'll look to either continue to refine the products we sell now and look for demand charges that could be either [faster] or more associated with the customers' fixed charges and look for other products that we can develop to give them access to data analysis and sustainability targets that they have.", "Shahriar Pourreza -- Guggenheim Securities -- Analyst", "Got it. Got it. And just lastly, Joe, I know you obviously highlighted that the rating agencies understand how transient in nature the cash flow dip is in 2020.", "Can you just remind us just from a perpetual or ongoing perspective how to think about the $250 million cost savings and the ExGen capex reductions for our modeling perspective?", "Joseph Nigro -- Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Yes. I would say right now, most of the $250 million we're viewing as a onetime item. And some of it's being driven by the situation when you think about with things like reducing contractor spend, reducing noncritical IT spend, when you look at reductions in travel spending, consulting spend, holding vacancy rates in our organization, all of those things are contributing to the reduction in", "O&M. I will say, though, when we go through our planning process, which begins here late in the second quarter and through the end of the year, we've had a track record of continuing to challenge ourselves and find ways to reduce costs.", "And given the environment we're in and some of the things, quite frankly, we've learned we may be able to carry over some of these cost savings as we look at future periods.", "Next question comes from the line of James Thalacker from BMO Capital Markets. Your line is now open.", "James Macdonald Thalacker -- BMO Capital Markets -- Analyst", "This is obviously a little bit more of a granular question. But just looking on slide 14, there was $100 million, I guess, change from December in the non-powered new business to go.", "I was just wondering if you guys could talk a little bit about what's exactly in that bucket.", "Joseph Nigro -- Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Yes. The $100 million non-powered new business to go is attributed partially to execution and partially, as I said in my prepared remarks, in Q1, we've had we had impact both on power and non-power related to weather, and we took a reduction for the balance of the year.", "That's all embedded in the total $300 million that you see in the gross margin change in the hedge disclosure.", "James Macdonald Thalacker -- BMO Capital Markets -- Analyst", "Okay. I was just wondering, was it a specific product that you guys are selling that where you saw the weather impact?", "Joseph Nigro -- Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "What's embedded in that non-power to go is the bulk of it is our a big piece of it is our gas business.", "And since that's so seasonal and related to the winter, you see the impact there.", "James Macdonald Thalacker -- BMO Capital Markets -- Analyst", "Next question comes from the line of Durgesh Chopra from Evercore. Your line is now open.", "Durgesh Chopra -- Evercore ISI Institutional Equities -- Analyst", "I just have a quick clarification question. You answered most of the things I had. In terms of just states or territories where you don't have riders on COVID costs like bad debt, just want to clarify that you're assuming recovery of those in the future, right?", "So the $250 million kind of targeted cost reductions don't cover that.", "Calvin G. Butler Jr -- Senior Executive Vice President of Exelon and Chief Executive Officer", "No, they don't. This is Calvin. In all of our jurisdictions where we are not for our bad debt and we do not have a rider, we are working in partnership with the commissions to sit back and establish regulatory assets.", "As Chris alluded to in his opening comments, Maryland and D.C., both of their commissions unanimously passed regulation allowing the utilities to set up regulatory assets and also set aside what identify prudently incurred COVID-related costs.", "And we will operate under the same standard that we used to operating on, showing that it's just and reasonable.", "We are working with the Pennsylvania Commission and Delaware Commission, and we hope to have rulings from them in the next week to 10 days to drive that.", "So at the end of this, all of our jurisdictions, we believe will be operating under a regulatory asset to show what those are bad debt costs and the COVID-related costs are.", "Next question comes from the line of Julien Dumoulin-Smith of Bank of America. Your line is now open.", "Julien Patrick Dumoulin -- BofA Merrill Lynch -- Analyst", "Wanted to follow up, perhaps clean up a little bit on some of the questions, thus far. First, with respect to the earnings CAGR and how you're thinking about that.", "Thus for the oscillations in the 30-year treasury, anything else shifting in your outlook? Obviously, the slide is slightly different here.", "So I just want to make sure we're not missing anything, coming back to Steve's question.", "Joseph Nigro -- Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Julien, there's nothing else shifting that CAGR other than the 30-year treasury.", "Julien Patrick Dumoulin -- BofA Merrill Lynch -- Analyst", "Okay. All right. Glad we've set that one aside. Separately, if I can keep here on the Constellation business and ExGen overall.", "When you think about the sensitivities to further you saw a faster or slower improvement here. Can you give us a little bit of a sense?", "And I mean that more in the context of C&I sales, degradation improvement as well as some of the portfolio optimization and volatility dynamics here as well and how that could play out in 2020 as well as what are you reflecting in 2021?", "Chris M. Crane -- President And Chief Executive Officer", "Jim, you want to cover that? I'm not sure we've covered 2021 yet, but we can cover 2020.", "James McHugh -- Chief Executive Officer , Constellation Executive Vice President", "Yes. Sure. Glad to do it. Thanks, Julien. The way we think about the balance for this year, and then I'll talk about 2021, you see the sensitivity on the slide that for every 1% change in C&I load, you see about a $15 million net income impact.", "And resi is about a $7 million impact. We've assumed, as we said, a slow return through the balance for this year and into next year.", "So what the 1% sensitivity at least allow you to do is, say, well, if any if across all those months, it moves up or down 1%, that's the number you would expect.", "I think as far as the optimization activity with these gross margin estimates we've given you, we see line of sight to being able to hit our normal optimization activity in the remainder of the new business to go bucket.", "So we don't expect too much impact there. We've basically realigned these targets now with these adjustments to have good line of sight to balance of the year.", "For 2021, we've included about $50 million of impact for COVID, and that is more a little bit of an impact on the load trickling into the year, but it also represents the fact that some of the new business activity to sign customers up has slowed down just because of the status of work that people are in.", "We've been tracking that, and we feel like that's a really good estimate right now, and we've been able to maintain pretty good signing up of new customers, a little bit of dip in the win and renewal rates for the month of April.", "As we get granular on really being able to understand which loads are impacted by how much, those win rates and renew rates bounce back up to, I think, more on normal levels.", "And the $50 million we've included is a good estimate.", "Julien Patrick Dumoulin -- BofA Merrill Lynch -- Analyst", "Okay. Excellent. Sorry, if I can just clarify your prior response very briefly? With respect to what's the date as of for the 30-year treasury that you are assuming in that EPS CAGR?", "I just want to be extra clear. Again, I don't know if you have a specific date or curve that you're using, but do you want to establish that.", "Joseph Nigro -- Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Yes. 3/31 is the date we're using, the end of the first quarter.", "Julien Patrick Dumoulin -- BofA Merrill Lynch -- Analyst", "Joseph Nigro -- Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "There are no further questions at this time. Mr. Chris Crane, do you have any closing remarks?", "Chris M. Crane -- President And Chief Executive Officer", "Yes. No, thank you all for joining the call. I want to thank our employees for their commitment and dedication in these unprecedented times.", "And I hope that all of you and your families are safe and healthy.

We want to participate in a market that’s designed to not only protect the consumers, the cost element, the reliability element, but allow us to make the investments and operate our plants safely and reliably,” Crane said", "In its 10-K filing, Exelon suggests SpinCo will depend on an “optimal structure and composition of its generation assets” for growth, and that it will explore “wholesale and retail opportunities within the power and gas sectors.”", "A key strategy is to “ensure appropriate valuation of its generation assets, in part through public policy efforts, identify and capitalize on opportunities that match supply to customers as a means to provide stable earnings, and identify emerging technologies where strategic investments provide the option for significant future growth or influence in market development.”", "But how SpinCo will be structured appears to be still under discussion.

In December 2020, the group agreed to sell a significant portion of its solar business to an affiliate of Brookfield Renewable Partners, including 360 MW in operation or under construction at more than 600 sites across the U.S. Completion of the $810 million transaction is slated to close in the first half of 2021.", "Exelon, which said proceeds from the sale would be used for general corporate purposes, also noted it plans to retain “certain solar assets,” primarily its 242-MW Antelope Valley solar installation in California.", "More changes to Exelon Generation’s portfolio may be on the horizon. On Wednesday, it said that “to maintain the generation fleet’s legacy of safety, operational excellence and financial stewardship, the company will retire uneconomic assets that negatively affect its ability to provide a reliable source of clean power to tens of millions of American homes and businesses.”", "But so far, of its fossil fleet, only two gas-fired units at the Mystic Generating Station (Units 8 and 9, a combined 1.7 MW) are slated for retirement in May 2024.", "Exelon moved to retire the units in August 2020 after the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) denied Exelon’s complaint alleging ISO-New England failed to follow its tariff for transmission security.", "The company has been much more vocal about its economically distressed nuclear fleet. Exelon outlined a long list of risks and concerns for its substantial nuclear fleet, even as Crane on Wednesday highlighted “another very good year” for its nuclear plants, which generated 150 TWh with an average capacity factor of 95.4%—“second only to last year’s performance in fleet history,” he said.", "(POWER highlighted Exelon nuclear group’s performance and achievements last year, including it completion of 12 refueling outages in fewer days than planned, despite formidable COVID-19 restrictions).", "Exelon in August 2020 moved to permanently retire two Illinois plants, the 2.3-GW Byron nuclear plant (Figure 1) in September 2021 and its 1.8-GW Dresden plant in November 2021, after they failed to clear PJM’s 2021–2022 planning year auction.", "On Wednesday, it said its 2.3-GW Braidwood nuclear plant in Illinois is also “showing signs of economic distress, in a market that does not currently compensate them for their unique contribution to grid resiliency and their ability to produce large amounts of energy without carbon and air pollution.”", "And while all of the 2.3-GW LaSalle nuclear plant’s capacity cleared PJM Interconnection’s 2021–2022 planning year auction, Exelon has also “become increasingly concerned about the economic viability of this plant as well in a landscape where energy market prices remain depressed and energy market rules remain fatally flawed,” it said.", "Exelon in September 2019 permanently shuttered its Three Mile Island nuclear plant in Pennsylvania, having failed to obtain policy reforms to keep it open.", "Illinois, however, enacted the Future Energy Jobs Act in December 2016 (it went into effect in June 2017), which helped keep Exelon’s Clinton and Quad Cities plants running.", "Exelon also strongly backed New York’s Clean Energy Standard, a measure that became effective in April 2017, to preserve the at-risk Nine Mile Point, FitzPatrick, and Ginna reactors in upstate New York.", "And in 2018, New Jersey also enacted zero-emission credits (ZECs) to bolster profitability of the Hope Creek plant, which is owned by PSEG, and Salem, whose output Exelon owns jointly with PSEG.", "A key concern for Exelon is if FERC’s December 2019 Minimum Offer Price Rule order in PJM will undermine the continuation of the Illinois and New Jersey programs, it said on Wednesday.", "Exelon has backed a Fixed Resource Requirement in those states through which Exelon’s nuclear plants would be removed from PJM’s capacity auction, it noted.", "Meanwhile, it is also backing a comprehensive energy package in Illinois.", "“The Governor [J.B. Pritzker] has called for passing an energy bill this session that protects our nuclear fleet, grows renewable energy, and supports customers and job creation.", "We expect the legislative process to ramp up in the coming weeks and months,” said Crane.", "Nigro on Wednesday suggested SpinCo is uniquely positioned because it mostly operate in states that have or are considering ambitious clean energy goals.", "“The company will continue to be a leading advocate for clean energy policies aimed at preserving and growing clean energy to combat the climate crisis,” he said.", "Exelon is also supportive of the Nuclear Powers America Act of 2019, a bill introduced in April 2019 in Congress, which expands the current investment tax credit to existing nuclear power plants.", "Kathleen Barrón, executive vice president of Exelon’s Government and Regulatory Affairs and Public Policy, on Wednesday also noted the company is “working with folks in Washington” to bolster development of a national clean energy standard, as well as to shape federal carbon legislation.", "Efforts related to a “carbon tax dividend approach” currently focus on ensuring “the proper design is included in the sense that we need something that is going to be cognizant of the customer impact, but also aggressive enough to address the challenge of the climate crisis,” she said.", "Barrón, however, acknowledged that federal efforts “take time to enact,” which is why Exelon’s focus remains at a state level.", "Nigro said that despite “uncertainties” that could impact SpinCo’s future, “such as legislation in Illinois, the next PJM auction, and potential federal carbon legislation,” SpinCo will continue to focus on its “strong investment-grade rated balance sheet supported by stable free cash flows, which we see in the different scenarios we are currently considering.”", "Exelon has “a strong record of cost management, with announced savings of more than $1.1 billion since 2015 and that cost discipline will not change,” he explained.", "“We will continue to seek fair compensation for the zero-carbon attributes, while maintaining the discipline to retire on economic assets and opportunistically monetize others.”", "—Sonal Patel is a POWER senior associate editor (@sonalcpatel, @POWERmagazine)."]}

Taft-Vazquez explains that social issues are hard to evaluate due to the broad agenda and lack of standardized reporting.", "Scientific metrics might allow you to calculate things like the size of a carbon footprint, but it’s more complicated to figure out if there are enough inclusive opportunities at a company, or if someone’s rights are being infringed upon somewhere in the supply chain.", "But that self-reflection, says Taft-Vazquez, is still crucial, as is being challenged by investors and stakeholders: “The industry is in the throes of figuring out how to measure social impact.", "This is an area that is evolving and needs to evolve, so that we move from measuring inputs to measuring impact.”", "Elebua explains that a key priority in his industry is to ensure that the economic and environmental benefits of clean energy are shared equally.", "“We cannot try to solve an environmental problem with a strategy that creates social inequities,” says Elebua.", "“As we move towards this net-zero future, we want to ensure that it is done equitably.” (As part of its “Path to Clean” commitment, Exelon partners with underserved and low-income communities — people who are disproportionately impacted by the effects of climate change — to make sure that all customers have access to affordable and clean energy.)", "Despite all these hurdles, this much is certain about ESG: Thinking about sustainability and societal consequences is a step in the right direction.", "When Taft-Vazquez worked at Gap Inc. in the early 2000s as a business analyst in the social responsibility department, there was general denial across the industry as to the private sector’s responsibility to tackle environmental and social issues.", "The pace of offshoring was accelerating in the apparel industry — along with allegations of sweatshops — and that’s when, recalls Taft-Vazquez, labor and environmental advocates started highlighting the winners and losers of globalization.", "Over the past 20 years, she’s since seen the industry move from managing ESG issues to risk mitigation to where it is now: focusing on value creation and making a positive impact.", "“Companies are certainly at different points of maturity,” she says, “but what I love to see is that these ESG topics are getting mainstreamed into company culture instead of being the role of one single department.”", "There are some economic advantages, of course, to being a company with strong ESG values. A January report by First Insight and Wharton’s Baker Retailing Center found that two-thirds of consumers will pay extra for a brand that’s better for the environment.", "Customers across all generations are willing to spend more for sustainability — including nearly 90 percent of Gen X.", "Elebua adds that customers play a key role in how quickly we can achieve the energy transition — especially modifying behaviors toward energy choices.", "“Policy will set the landscape, technology will offer you the choice, and the customer will make the decision,” he says.", "“And they all must move in tandem to achieve meaningful impact.”", "What’s more, such a company can attract employees who feel passionate about ESG priorities. And, finally, there’s the appeal of wooing investors who are keen on impact (or even just the next big thing).", "“There have been large amounts of funds that have raised billions for sustainability initiatives in the last couple of years,” says Moseley.", "“Investors go to where the next huge markets or big opportunities are.”", "Eco-friendly sneaker company Allbirds, which earned B-Corp status in 2016, was developed with steadfast carbon-neutral vision; its co-founder, Joey Zwillinger WG10, pledged to reduce its footprint to near zero by 2030.", "When Allbirds went public about a year ago, its IPO — and targeted $2.2 billion valuation at the time — proved intriguing to investors looking for a company with a sustainability mission.", "Allbirds shares surged 91 percent on the first day of investing, nearly doubling its valuation to more than $4 billion.", "Although it’s easy to root for a green or socially responsible company, that doesn’t guarantee a return on investment.", "“I don’t think there’s an absolutely clear picture right now that shows that companies with strong ESG bona fides are necessarily outperforming,” says Offutt.", "The uncertainty, he adds, is in large part due to not having enough of the right data: “All companies put out these glossy sustainability reports, and some are truly doing wonderful things.", "And others are just making a really great glossy report.” Sharing specific metrics that speak to climate transition preparedness, consumer opinion, or community engagement might better flag risks and highlight opportunities.", "A good idea, says Offutt, is to identify a company that excels at overall managing. Well-governed firms are good at everything — including aspects related to environmental and social performance.", "He adds that long-term success is dependent on whether ESG is in a company’s DNA. Instead of being guided by the triple bottom line of people, planet, and profits — or the “three-legged stool” of sustainability — companies should prioritize these goals so that the environment is at the forefront of daily decision-making.", "Forgacs explains that you can’t unlock the potential of ESG unless you couple it with a viable business model.", "“There’s a lot of innovation out there,” he says. “But if your only benefit is sustainability, then you’re not going to have real-world impact.”", "Actual change, he says, is found at the intersection of three things: the performance of the product or service; accessibility or scalability of the offering; and real, measurable sustainability.", "Taft-Vazquez is optimistic that businesses are up for that challenge. “We’re going to be seeing an increase in what companies are expected to do and willingness of companies to do more,” she says.", "Partnerships have proven to be critical to advancing these ESG goals — including industry collaboration among peers.", "“The most systemic issues can’t be addressed by a single company,” says Taft-Vazquez. (To point: Coke partners with the United Nations, which has outlined 17 “Sustainable Development Goals” to serve as a blueprint for companies, and also works with the World Wildlife Fund and The Ocean Cleanup, just to name a few.)", "A transition to a more sustainable economy comes with its own set of challenges, but Seeger expects that convergence around terminology and the regulatory movement should help.", "Furthermore, the European Union is rolling out its standards for sustainability reporting even as the SEC is proposing enhanced disclosures about ESG practices, which could be adopted in the near future.", "Improvement in these two areas can help companies, and investors, make more informed and more sustainable investment decisions.", "“A lot of people are waking up to the urgency of climate change,” says Moseley. “They’re also realizing that future solutions for these issues could become some of the biggest companies out there.”", "Forgacs estimates that environmental challenges facing the world will require spending billions, if not trillions, of dollars over the next decade; by the end of the century, climate change costs could reach $2 trillion annually in the U.S. alone, according to White House analysis.", "Companies that can address these issues — and help others develop great business models — will offer not just a return for the environment, but a financial one as well.", "“Where there is an unmet need and an allocation of resources to address that need,” says Forgacs, “there is opportunity.”", "Amy Downey is a freelance writer based in Allentown, Pennsylvania.", "Published as “Profits and Purpose” in the Fall/Winter 2022 issue of Wharton Magazine."]}

This cautionary language picked up on warnings in the March 14, 2001 Form 8-K and provided investors with detailed information as to the factors that might affect Exelon's business.", "Finally, Plaintiffs challenge Defendants' assurances in the August 14, 2001 Form 10-Q that Exelon would meet its 2001 EPS target.", "The Form contained a paragraph identifying statements in the filing as forward-looking and warned that factors including \"those discussed herein as well as those listed in Note 7 of Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, those discussed in \"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation-Outlook\" in Exelon Corporation's 2000 Annual Report, and other factors discussed in filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission could affect results.\"", "( Id., Ex.

Therefore, Plaintiffs' allegations of motive and opportunity do not give rise to a strong inference of scienter.", "Plaintiffs, however, contend that the bulk of their scienter allegations fall into the second category of strong circumstantial evidence of scienter.", "Plaintiffs maintain that they adequately plead circumstantial evidence with their allegations that Defendants failed to disclose that \"adverse market conditions, economic weakness, declining energy prices and undisclosed company specific information evidencing the collapse of Exelon's Enterprises business segment\" made the $4.50 EPS target unattainable.", "(R. 27, Pls.' Mem. at 18-21.) Defendants, in turn, maintain that Plaintiffs fail to allege with particularity facts that indicate that Defendants knew the projections would not be met.", "Plaintiffs, they argue, essentially plead fraud by hindsight.", "We agree that Plaintiffs' allegations that Defendants knew the projections would not be met are conclusory and insufficient to plead actual knowledge.", "Plaintiffs essentially assert that Defendants must have known that the EPS target would not be met because of challenges at Enterprises due to the decline of the telecommunications industry and because of the negative effects of cool weather and lower energy prices on Generation, which held long-term power contracts.", "A large portion of Plaintiffs' allegations describe challenges faced by Enterprises, labeled as a long-term money earner from the time of the merger.", "It was never expected, however, that Enterprises would contribute significantly to earnings in 2001. In fact, Enterprises was expected to report a $15 million loss in 2001; EBIT were projected at $60 million, contributing only 1.7% of Exelon's projected earnings.", "in contrast, Delivery, to which Plaintiffs address few if any particularized allegations, was projected to earn $2,460,000 million, contributing 70% of Exelon's earnings in 2001; Generation was expected to contribute 28% of 2001 earnings.", "Thus, Plaintiffs' detailed allegations regarding the problems at Enterprises do not adequately plead knowledge of falsity because Enterprises was never expected to contribute significantly to earnings in 2001.", "Plaintiffs add allegations of adverse market conditions, economic weakness and declining energy prices to make their case for actual knowledge.", "Nevertheless, Exelon as a whole performed well during the first half of 2001, chipping away at Plaintiffs' argument that Defendants knew the projections would not be met.", "For example, Exelon reported earnings per share of $1.23 in the first quarter of 2001, 27% of the $4.50 projection and within the quarterly distribution of 20-30%.", "(R. 18-1, Defs.'

Supp.2d at 838. Rather, a plaintiff must also plead facts that support an inference that a defendant acted with reckless disregard or gross indifference to alleged misrepresentations in financial statements.", "Id. Facts that might support such an inference include those detailing the magnitude of the accounting error, a defendant's prior notice of the error or a defendant's responsibility for calculating and disseminating financial information.", "Two of Plaintiffs' alleged GAAP violations relate to Exelon's reporting on its investment in Corvis. Exelon, Plaintiffs argue, should not have recorded a $10 million gain in Corvis during the first quarter of 2001 and should have recorded an impairment in the value of Corvis during the first or second quarters of 2001 rather than the third quarter.", "With respect to the first quarter $10 million gain, the parties dispute whether Exelon properly recorded the gain.", "Plaintiffs assert that the Corvis shares were transferred among entities under common control and thus should not have been revalued; Defendants maintain that the shares were distributed from an investment limited partnership under the cost method of accounting, which allowed Exelon to revalue the shares to the extent their current value exceeded their cost.", "Plaintiffs' allegations regarding the gain, however, do not necessitate that we delve into the maze of GAAP.", "Assuming arguendo that the decision to record the $10 million gain was a violation of GAAP, this fact does not support a strong inference scienter.", "Plaintiffs must allege that Defendants made this error with reckless disregard or gross difference, which in this case is not shown by the relatively insignificant error.", "Id. Plaintiffs allege that the gain inflated Exelon's net income for the first quarter; net income was reported at $399, inflated by the Corvis gain by less than 3%, which does not raise a strong inference of scienter.", "See Greebel v.

Ernst Young, 901 F.2d 624, 626 (7th Cir. 1990). In DiLeo, plaintiffs alleged that defendant accounting company certified fraudulent financial statements that understated losses from bad loans by about $4 billion.", "In affirming the dismissal of the complaint for failure to plead fraud with particularity, the Seventh Circuit noted that \"[i]f all that is involved is a dispute about the timing of the writeoff, based on estimates of the probability that a particular debtor will pay, we do not have fraud; we may not even have negligence.\"", "Id. Here, the probability was not whether a debtor would pay but rather whether the value of Corvis shares would increase.", "Despite the falling price of Corvis shares during the first half of 2001, Defendants did not write down their investment in Corvis during the first two quarters, holding out for a rebound in the share price.", "Perhaps the delay in reporting the write down was overly-optimistic, but as noted in DiLeo, for every write-down, there is always someone who says the company should have acted sooner.", "In this case, Plaintiffs only assert that the company should have reported the impairment three to six months before it actually did so.", "Furthermore, as noted by Defendants, even if Exelon had not recorded the $10 million gain and had recorded the $36 million charge, EPS would still have been in the projected target range for the first two quarters of 2001.", "(R. 20, Defs.' Reply at 18 n. 24.) Plaintiffs' GAAP violations allege relatively modest amounts of improperly recorded gains and losses when compared to the hundreds of millions of dollars the company was earning each quarter.", "In short, the allegations involving Corvis do not raise a strong inference of scienter, as required by the PSLRA.", "Finally, Plaintiffs' allegations that Exelon failed to timely record impaired goodwill in the amount of $243 million also fail because they are not plead with particularity and do not give rise to a strong inference of scienter.", "Plaintiffs allege that the value of Enterprises was impaired as early as June 30, 2001 due to Enterprises' investment in the declining telecommunications industry, including Corvis, but that Exelon waited until March 31, 2002 to report the charge.", "The allegations, however, largely lack detail as to which businesses or assets were impaired and by how much and why the write down was necessary after the first half of 2001, all necessary elements of pleading fraud with particularity.", "Rather, the allegations strike the Court as ones of fraud by hindsight; Plaintiffs do not allege any specifics on the amount of write-downs that should have been taken in 2001, but point to the $243 million charge in the first quarter of 2002 and argue that it should have been taken sooner, without allegations to support this contention.", "Such generalized allegations cannot raise an inference of scienter.

Padda, No. 00 C 5070, 2001 WL 1163728, at *9 (N.D.Ill. Sept. 28, 2001).", "In this era of focused attention on issues of corporate fraud and responsibility, the Court has very carefully reviewed Plaintiffs' complaint.", "Nonetheless, the complaint fails on various grounds. Defendants' earnings projections were accompanied by sufficient cautionary language such that the statements fall under the first prong of the PSLRA's safe harbor.", "In addition, Plaintiffs fail to plead facts that give rise to a strong inference of scienter as required by the PSLRA-actual knowledge with respect to the forwardlooking statements and recklessness with respect to the remaining statements.", "The Court recognizes that leave to amend should be granted freely, but in this case, any amendment to the instant complaint would be futile.", "The extensive cautionary language bars any claims based on the projections, and the GAAP violations are essentially timing issues, which the Seventh Circuit suggests cannot constitute fraud.", "DiLeo, 901 F.2d at 626.

IMCERA Group Inc., 47 F.3d 47, 54 (2d Cir. 1995) (rejecting plaintiffs allegation that defendants were motivated to defraud the public because an inflated stock price would increase their compensation because \"[i]f scienter could be pleaded on that basis alone, virtually every company in the United States . .", ". could be forced to defend securities fraud actions\"). Therefore, Plaintiffs' allegations of motive and opportunity do not give rise to a strong inference of scienter.", "Plaintiffs, however, contend that the bulk of their scienter allegations fall into the second category of strong circumstantial evidence of scienter.", "Plaintiffs maintain that they adequately plead circumstantial evidence with their allegations that Defendants failed to disclose that \"adverse market conditions, economic weakness, declining energy prices and undisclosed company specific information evidencing the collapse of Exelon's Enterprises business segment\" made the $4.50 EPS target unattainable.", "(R. 27, Pls.' Mem. at 18-21.) Defendants, in turn, maintain that Plaintiffs fail to allege with particularity facts that indicate that Defendants knew the projections would not be met.", "Plaintiffs, they argue, essentially plead fraud by hindsight.", "We agree that Plaintiffs' allegations that Defendants knew the projections would not be met are conclusory and insufficient to plead actual knowledge.", "Plaintiffs essentially assert that Defendants must have known that the EPS target would not be met because of challenges at Enterprises due to the decline of the telecommunications industry and because of the negative effects of cool weather and lower energy prices on Generation, which held long-term power contracts.", "A large portion of Plaintiffs' allegations describe challenges faced by Enterprises, labeled as a long-term money earner from the time of the merger.", "It was never expected, however, that Enterprises would contribute significantly to earnings in 2001. In fact, Enterprises was expected to report a $15 million loss in 2001; EBIT were projected at $60 million, contributing only 1.7% of Exelon's projected earnings.", "in contrast, Delivery, to which Plaintiffs address few if any particularized allegations, was projected to earn $2,460,000 million, contributing 70% of Exelon's earnings in 2001; Generation was expected to contribute 28% of 2001 earnings.", "Thus, Plaintiffs' detailed allegations regarding the problems at Enterprises do not adequately plead knowledge of falsity because Enterprises was never expected to contribute significantly to earnings in 2001.", "Plaintiffs add allegations of adverse market conditions, economic weakness and declining energy prices to make their case for actual knowledge.", "Nevertheless, Exelon as a whole performed well during the first half of 2001, chipping away at Plaintiffs' argument that Defendants knew the projections would not be met.", "For example, Exelon reported earnings per share of $1.23 in the first quarter of 2001, 27% of the $4.50 projection and within the quarterly distribution of 20-30%.", "(R. 18-1, Defs.' Exs., Vol. 1, Ex. E, Apr. 24, 2001 8-K.) Second quarter earnings, despite the challenges catalogued by Plaintiffs, slightly exceeded the company's projection for that quarter, reported at $.97 per diluted share.", "( Id., Ex. I, July 24, 2001 8-K.) Thus, we cannot infer from these facts that Defendants actually knew that the projection would not be met.", "Third quarter results were disappointing for Exelon due to a constellation of factors that the company warned could affect results, including cooler weather and the accompanying decline in energy prices, which the company disclosed in the September 27, 2001 press release.", "Nevertheless, given the strong performance of the core business of Generation and Delivery throughout 2001 despite these challenges, we conclude that Plaintiffs do not plead facts sufficient to imply actual knowledge of falsity of the projection.", "See In re Hall, Kinion Assocs., Inc., Secs. Litig., No. C 99-02943 WHA, 2000 WL 1639503, at *2 (N.D.Cal.", "Oct. 27, 2000) (dismissing complaint for failure to plead scienter; \"[a]ctual knowledge of falsity could be shown only if the internal circumstances were so gloomy that it was unlikely that managers in the shoes of defendants could have reasonably believed the external projections\").", "The Court acknowledges that although it is not necessary for Plaintiffs to plead a \"smoking gun,\" they must plead with particularity facts that imply that a defendant knew that the projection was false.", "For example, a plaintiff might present circumstantial evidence that a defendant received a contemporaneous report that contradicted an alleged misrepresentation or that a witness informed a defendant of the falsity of the statement before it was made.", "See In re Northpoint Communications Group, Inc., Secs. Litig., 184 F. Supp.2d 991, 997-98 (N.D.Cal. 2001).", "Or, as in one of the cases cited by Plaintiffs, a plaintiffs allegations of insider trading can raise an inference of actual knowledge.", "See In re Sensormatic Elecs. Corp. Secs. Litig., No. 018346, 2002 WL 1352427, at *6-7 (S.D.Fla. June 10, 2002)", "(holding that \"out of line\" insider trading supported a strong inference of scienter where sales were made after meeting disclosing adverse sales trends but before public announcement of trends and subsequent stock drop).", "A plaintiff might also plead that key officers knew of facts critical to a business's core operations or to an important transaction that would affect a company's performance.", "Id.See also Manavazian v. Atec Group, Inc., 160 F. Supp.2d 468, 484-85 (E.D.N.Y. 2001) (denying motion to dismiss where plaintiffs alleged that defendants knew that the company's core business had materially shrunk and that defendants engaged in unusual insider trading);", "In re Peoplesoft Inc. Secs. Litig., 2000 WL 1737936, at *2-3 (N.D.Cal. May 25, 2000) (holding that complaint adequately alleged scienter where flagship software products were laced with an abnormally large number of defects and major customers threatened to sue over defects, management was on notice that quotas and budgets could not be met and insider trading occurred).", "In short, the instant complaint, which largely focuses on problems at Enterprises, Exelon's smallest segment that was projected to contribute less than 2% of earnings in 2001, lacks the type or combination of allegations that give rise to a strong inference of actual knowledge of falsity.", "Rather, the allegations show that Defendants had a reasonable basis for reaffirming Exelon's earnings projection.", "As such, the second prong of the PSLRA's safe harbor applies because Plaintiffs fail to allege facts that strongly imply that the statements reaffirming the earnings projections were made with actual knowledge that the statements were false or misleading.", "In addition, because the statements reaffirming Exelon's projections had a reasonable basis in fact, the regulatory safe harbor of SEC Rule 3b-6 also immunizes these statements.", "17 C.F.R. § 240.3b-6. See Arazie v. Mullane, 2 F.3d 1456 (7th Cir. 1993).", "As further evidence of scienter, Plaintiffs also claim that Defendants violated GAAP by: (1) recording a $10 million gain on its investments in Corvis during the first quarter of 2001; (2) failing to record an impairment in the value of its investment in Corvis during the first or second quarters of 2001; and (3) failing to record a loss due to an impairment in the carrying value of its reported goodwill during the first half of 2001.", "Defendants argue that these facts do not allege GAAP violations or support a strong inference of scienter.", "We agree that Plaintiffs' GAAP allegations do not support a strong inference of scienter.", "As we noted in Chu II, allegations of GAAP violations, standing alone, are insufficient to raise an inference of scienter.", "Chu II, 100 F. Supp.2d at 838. Rather, a plaintiff must also plead facts that support an inference that a defendant acted with reckless disregard or gross indifference to alleged misrepresentations in financial statements.", "Id. Facts that might support such an inference include those detailing the magnitude of the accounting error, a defendant's prior notice of the error or a defendant's responsibility for calculating and disseminating financial information.", "Two of Plaintiffs' alleged GAAP violations relate to Exelon's reporting on its investment in Corvis. Exelon, Plaintiffs argue, should not have recorded a $10 million gain in Corvis during the first quarter of 2001 and should have recorded an impairment in the value of Corvis during the first or second quarters of 2001 rather than the third quarter.", "With respect to the first quarter $10 million gain, the parties dispute whether Exelon properly recorded the gain.", "Plaintiffs assert that the Corvis shares were transferred among entities under common control and thus should not have been revalued; Defendants maintain that the shares were distributed from an investment limited partnership under the cost method of accounting, which allowed Exelon to revalue the shares to the extent their current value exceeded their cost.", "Plaintiffs' allegations regarding the gain, however, do not necessitate that we delve into the maze of GAAP.", "Assuming arguendo that the decision to record the $10 million gain was a violation of GAAP, this fact does not support a strong inference scienter.", "Plaintiffs must allege that Defendants made this error with reckless disregard or gross difference, which in this case is not shown by the relatively insignificant error.", "Id. Plaintiffs allege that the gain inflated Exelon's net income for the first quarter; net income was reported at $399, inflated by the Corvis gain by less than 3%, which does not raise a strong inference of scienter.", "See Greebel v. FTP Software, Inc., 194 F.3d 185, 206 (1st Cir. 1999) (concluding that improperly recorded revenue that raised overall revenue by up to 4% did not support a strong inference of scienter); In re Allscripts, Inc. Secs.", "Litig., No. 00 C 6796, 2001 WL 743411, at *10-11 (N.D.Ill. June 29, 2001) (same). Cf. Chalverus v. Pegasystems, Inc., 59 F. Supp.2d 226, 228-29 (D.Mass. 1999) (denying motion to dismiss where GAAP violation alleged improper reporting of $5 million in software license revenue where overall software license revenue was $9 million).", "Plaintiffs' allegation that Exelon failed to timely record an impairment in the value of Corvis also does not support an inference of scienter.", "Although Exelon wrote down the investment in the third quarter of 2001, Plaintiffs contend that the impairment should have been recorded in the first or second quarter of 2001.", "The impairment, Plaintiffs argue, should have been recognizable to Exelon as \"otherthan-temporary\" under GAAP during the first half of 2001.", "The fact remains, however, that Defendants did write down the investment in Corvis in the third quarter and thus the parties only dispute when the write down should have occurred.", "In an analogous context, the Seventh Circuit held that this type of timing dispute does not adequately plead fraud.", "See DiLeo v. Ernst Young, 901 F.2d 624, 626 (7th Cir. 1990). In DiLeo, plaintiffs alleged that defendant accounting company certified fraudulent financial statements that understated losses from bad loans by about $4 billion.", "In affirming the dismissal of the complaint for failure to plead fraud with particularity, the Seventh Circuit noted that \"[i]f all that is involved is a dispute about the timing of the writeoff, based on estimates of the probability that a particular debtor will pay, we do not have fraud; we may not even have negligence.\"", "Id. Here, the probability was not whether a debtor would pay but rather whether the value of Corvis shares would increase.", "Despite the falling price of Corvis shares during the first half of 2001, Defendants did not write down their investment in Corvis during the first two quarters, holding out for a rebound in the share price.", "Perhaps the delay in reporting the write down was overly-optimistic, but as noted in DiLeo, for every write-down, there is always someone who says the company should have acted sooner.", "In this case, Plaintiffs only assert that the company should have reported the impairment three to six months before it actually did so.", "Furthermore, as noted by Defendants, even if Exelon had not recorded the $10 million gain and had recorded the $36 million charge, EPS would still have been in the projected target range for the first two quarters of 2001.", "(R. 20, Defs.' Reply at 18 n. 24.) Plaintiffs' GAAP violations allege relatively modest amounts of improperly recorded gains and losses when compared to the hundreds of millions of dollars the company was earning each quarter.", "In short, the allegations involving Corvis do not raise a strong inference of scienter, as required by the PSLRA.", "Finally, Plaintiffs' allegations that Exelon failed to timely record impaired goodwill in the amount of $243 million also fail because they are not plead with particularity and do not give rise to a strong inference of scienter.", "Plaintiffs allege that the value of Enterprises was impaired as early as June 30, 2001 due to Enterprises' investment in the declining telecommunications industry, including Corvis, but that Exelon waited until March 31, 2002 to report the charge.", "The allegations, however, largely lack detail as to which businesses or assets were impaired and by how much and why the write down was necessary after the first half of 2001, all necessary elements of pleading fraud with particularity.", "Rather, the allegations strike the Court as ones of fraud by hindsight; Plaintiffs do not allege any specifics on the amount of write-downs that should have been taken in 2001, but point to the $243 million charge in the first quarter of 2002 and argue that it should have been taken sooner, without allegations to support this contention.", "Such generalized allegations cannot raise an inference of scienter. Cf. In re Revlon Secs. Litig., No. 99 Civ 10192, 2001 WL 293820, *1 (S.D.N.Y. Mar. 27, 2001) (denying in part motion to dismiss securities fraud action where plaintiffs plead particularized allegations that defendant falsified financial results through the recognition of \"revenue\" from false sales and the failure to timely write down excess and obsolete inventory and alleged that overstatements of net income were between 22% and 655%).", "In short, Plaintiffs' GAAP allegations lack particularity and do not give rise to a strong inference of scienter.", "In addition, because Plaintiffs fail to plead a primary cause of action under § 10 and Rule 10b-5, Plaintiffs' § 20(a) claims against the individual Defendants as controlling persons also fail.", "See Geinko v. Padda, No. 00 C 5070, 2001 WL 1163728, at *9 (N.D.Ill. Sept. 28, 2001).", "In this era of focused attention on issues of corporate fraud and responsibility, the Court has very carefully reviewed Plaintiffs' complaint.", "Nonetheless, the complaint fails on various grounds. Defendants' earnings projections were accompanied by sufficient cautionary language such that the statements fall under the first prong of the PSLRA's safe harbor.", "In addition, Plaintiffs fail to plead facts that give rise to a strong inference of scienter as required by the PSLRA-actual knowledge with respect to the forwardlooking statements and recklessness with respect to the remaining statements.", "The Court recognizes that leave to amend should be granted freely, but in this case, any amendment to the instant complaint would be futile.", "The extensive cautionary language bars any claims based on the projections, and the GAAP violations are essentially timing issues, which the Seventh Circuit suggests cannot constitute fraud.", "DiLeo, 901 F.2d at 626. As such, the Court grants Defendants' motion to dismiss with prejudice. (R. 17-1.)", "The Clerk of the Court is instructed to enter a final judgment, pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 58, in favor of Defendants."]}

This was the most serious accident in U.S. commercial nuclear power plant operating history, although its small radioactive releases had no detectable health effects on plant workers or the public.", "Its aftermath brought about sweeping changes involving emergency response planning, reactor operator training, human factors engineering, radiation protection, and many other areas of nuclear power plant operations.", "It also caused the NRC to tighten and heighten its regulatory oversight. All of these changes significantly enhanced U.S. reactor safety.", "A combination of equipment malfunctions, design-related problems and worker errors led to TMI-2’s partial meltdown and very small off site releases of radioactivity.", "The accident began about 4 a.m. on Wednesday, March 28, 1979, when the plant experienced a failure in the secondary, non-nuclear section of the plant (one of two reactors on the site).", "Either a mechanical or electrical failure prevented the main feedwater pumps—component (1) in the animated diagram)—from sending water to the steam generators (2) that remove heat from the reactor core (3).", "This caused the plant's turbine-generator (4) and then the reactor itself to automatically shut down.", "Immediately, the pressure in the primary system (the nuclear piping portion of the plant shown in orange) began to increase.", "In order to control that pressure, the pilot-operated relief valve (5) opened. It was located at the top of the pressurizer (6).", "The valve should have closed when the pressure fell to proper levels, but it became stuck open. Instruments in the control room, however, indicated to the plant staff that the valve was closed.", "As a result, the plant staff was unaware that cooling water in the form of steam was pouring out of the stuck-open valve.", "As alarms rang and warning lights flashed, the operators did not realize that the plant was experiencing a loss-of-coolant accident.", "Other instruments available to plant staff provided inadequate or misleading information. During normal operations, the large pressure vessel (7) that held the reactor core was always filled to the top with water.", "So there was no need for a water-level instrument to show whether water in the vessel covered the core.", "As a result, plant staff assumed that as long instruments showed that the pressurizer water level was high enough, the core was properly covered with water too.", "Unaware of the stuck-open relief valve and unable to tell if the core was covered with cooling water, the staff took a series of actions that uncovered the core.", "The stuck valve reduced primary system pressure so much that the reactor coolant pumps (8) started to vibrate and were turned off.", "The emergency cooling water being pumped into the primary system threatened to fill up the pressurizer completely—an undesirable condition—and they cut back on the flow of water.", "Without the reactor coolant pumps circulating water and with the primary system starved of emergency cooling water, the water level in the pressure vessel dropped and the core overheated.", "The following animated diagram graphically depicts the sequence of events associated with the accident at TMI-2.", "The NRC conducted detailed studies of the accident’s radiological consequences, as did the Environmental Protection Agency, the Department of Health, Education and Welfare (now Health and Human Services), the Department of Energy, and the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania.", "Several independent groups also conducted studies. The approximately 2 million people around TMI-2 during the accident are estimated to have received an average radiation dose of only about 1 millirem above the usual background dose.", "To put this into context, exposure from a chest X ray is about 6 millirem and the area’s natural radioactive background dose is about 100 125 millirem per year for the area.", "The accident’s maximum dose to a person at the site boundary would have been less than 100 millirem above background.", "In the months following the accident, although questions were raised about possible adverse effects from radiation on human, animal, and plant life in the TMI area, none could be directly correlated to the accident.", "Thousands of environmental samples of air, water, milk, vegetation, soil, and foodstuffs were collected by various government agencies monitoring the area.", "Very low levels of radionuclides could be attributed to releases from the accident. However, comprehensive investigations and assessments by several well respected organizations, such as Columbia University and the University of Pittsburgh, have concluded that in spite of serious damage to the reactor, the actual release had negligible effects on the physical health of individuals or the environment.", "A combination of personnel error, design deficiencies, and component failures caused the TMI accident, which permanently changed both the nuclear industry and the NRC.", "Public fear and distrust increased, NRC’s regulations and oversight became broader and more robust, and management of the plants was scrutinized more carefully.", "Careful analysis of the accident’s events identified problems and led to permanent and sweeping changes in how NRC regulates its licensees – which, in turn, has reduced the risk to public health and safety.", "Here are some of the major changes that have occurred since the accident:", "- Upgrading and strengthening of plant design and equipment requirements. This includes fire protection, piping systems, auxiliary feedwater systems, containment building isolation, reliability of individual components (pressure relief valves and electrical circuit breakers), and the ability of plants to shut down automatically;", "- Identifying the critical role of human performance in plant safety led to revamping operator training and staffing requirements, followed by improved instrumentation and controls for operating the plant, and establishment of fitness-for-duty programs for plant workers to guard against alcohol or drug abuse;", "- Enhancing emergency preparedness, including requirements for plants to immediately notify NRC of significant events and an NRC Operations Center staffed 24 hours a day.", "Drills and response plans are now tested by licensees several times a year, and state and local agencies participate in drills with the Federal Emergency Management Agency and the NRC;", "- Integrating NRC observations, findings, and conclusions about licensee performance and management effectiveness into a periodic, public report;", "- Having senior NRC managers regularly analyze plant performance for those plants needing significant additional regulatory attention;", "- Expanding NRC’s resident inspector program–first authorized in 1977–to have at least two inspectors live nearby and work exclusively at each plant in the U.S. to provide daily surveillance of licensee adherence to NRC regulations;", "- Expanding performance-oriented as well as safety oriented inspections, and the use of risk assessment to identify vulnerabilities of any plant to severe accidents;", "- Strengthening and reorganizing enforcement staff in a separate office within the NRC;", "- Establishing the Institute of Nuclear Power Operations, the industry’s own “policing” group, and formation of what is now the Nuclear Energy Institute to provide a unified industry approach to generic nuclear regulatory issues, and interaction with NRC and other government agencies;", "- Installing additional equipment by licensees to mitigate accident conditions, and monitor radiation levels and plant status;", "- Enacting programs by licensees for early identification of important safety related problems, and for collecting and assessing relevant data so operating experience can be shared and quickly acted upon; and", "- Expanding NRC’s international activities to share enhanced knowledge of nuclear safety with other countries in a number of important technical areas.", "Today, the TMI 2 reactor is permanently shut down and 99 percent of its fuel has been removed.

This was the most serious accident in U.S. commercial nuclear power plant operating history, although its small radioactive releases had no detectable health effects on plant workers or the public.", "Its aftermath brought about sweeping changes involving emergency response planning, reactor operator training, human factors engineering, radiation protection, and many other areas of nuclear power plant operations.", "It also caused the NRC to tighten and heighten its regulatory oversight. All of these changes significantly enhanced U.S. reactor safety.", "A combination of equipment malfunctions, design-related problems and worker errors led to TMI-2’s partial meltdown and very small off site releases of radioactivity.", "The accident began about 4 a.m. on Wednesday, March 28, 1979, when the plant experienced a failure in the secondary, non-nuclear section of the plant (one of two reactors on the site).", "Either a mechanical or electrical failure prevented the main feedwater pumps—component (1) in the animated diagram)—from sending water to the steam generators (2) that remove heat from the reactor core (3).", "This caused the plant's turbine-generator (4) and then the reactor itself to automatically shut down.", "Immediately, the pressure in the primary system (the nuclear piping portion of the plant shown in orange) began to increase.", "In order to control that pressure, the pilot-operated relief valve (5) opened. It was located at the top of the pressurizer (6).", "The valve should have closed when the pressure fell to proper levels, but it became stuck open. Instruments in the control room, however, indicated to the plant staff that the valve was closed.", "As a result, the plant staff was unaware that cooling water in the form of steam was pouring out of the stuck-open valve.", "As alarms rang and warning lights flashed, the operators did not realize that the plant was experiencing a loss-of-coolant accident.", "Other instruments available to plant staff provided inadequate or misleading information. During normal operations, the large pressure vessel (7) that held the reactor core was always filled to the top with water.", "So there was no need for a water-level instrument to show whether water in the vessel covered the core.", "As a result, plant staff assumed that as long instruments showed that the pressurizer water level was high enough, the core was properly covered with water too.", "Unaware of the stuck-open relief valve and unable to tell if the core was covered with cooling water, the staff took a series of actions that uncovered the core.", "The stuck valve reduced primary system pressure so much that the reactor coolant pumps (8) started to vibrate and were turned off.", "The emergency cooling water being pumped into the primary system threatened to fill up the pressurizer completely—an undesirable condition—and they cut back on the flow of water.", "Without the reactor coolant pumps circulating water and with the primary system starved of emergency cooling water, the water level in the pressure vessel dropped and the core overheated.", "The following animated diagram graphically depicts the sequence of events associated with the accident at TMI-2.", "The NRC conducted detailed studies of the accident’s radiological consequences, as did the Environmental Protection Agency, the Department of Health, Education and Welfare (now Health and Human Services), the Department of Energy, and the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania.", "Several independent groups also conducted studies. The approximately 2 million people around TMI-2 during the accident are estimated to have received an average radiation dose of only about 1 millirem above the usual background dose.", "To put this into context, exposure from a chest X ray is about 6 millirem and the area’s natural radioactive background dose is about 100 125 millirem per year for the area.", "The accident’s maximum dose to a person at the site boundary would have been less than 100 millirem above background.", "In the months following the accident, although questions were raised about possible adverse effects from radiation on human, animal, and plant life in the TMI area, none could be directly correlated to the accident.", "Thousands of environmental samples of air, water, milk, vegetation, soil, and foodstuffs were collected by various government agencies monitoring the area.", "Very low levels of radionuclides could be attributed to releases from the accident. However, comprehensive investigations and assessments by several well respected organizations, such as Columbia University and the University of Pittsburgh, have concluded that in spite of serious damage to the reactor, the actual release had negligible effects on the physical health of individuals or the environment.", "A combination of personnel error, design deficiencies, and component failures caused the TMI accident, which permanently changed both the nuclear industry and the NRC.", "Public fear and distrust increased, NRC’s regulations and oversight became broader and more robust, and management of the plants was scrutinized more carefully.", "Careful analysis of the accident’s events identified problems and led to permanent and sweeping changes in how NRC regulates its licensees – which, in turn, has reduced the risk to public health and safety.", "Here are some of the major changes that have occurred since the accident:", "- Upgrading and strengthening of plant design and equipment requirements. This includes fire protection, piping systems, auxiliary feedwater systems, containment building isolation, reliability of individual components (pressure relief valves and electrical circuit breakers), and the ability of plants to shut down automatically;", "- Identifying the critical role of human performance in plant safety led to revamping operator training and staffing requirements, followed by improved instrumentation and controls for operating the plant, and establishment of fitness-for-duty programs for plant workers to guard against alcohol or drug abuse;", "- Enhancing emergency preparedness, including requirements for plants to immediately notify NRC of significant events and an NRC Operations Center staffed 24 hours a day.", "Drills and response plans are now tested by licensees several times a year, and state and local agencies participate in drills with the Federal Emergency Management Agency and the NRC;", "- Integrating NRC observations, findings, and conclusions about licensee performance and management effectiveness into a periodic, public report;", "- Having senior NRC managers regularly analyze plant performance for those plants needing significant additional regulatory attention;", "- Expanding NRC’s resident inspector program–first authorized in 1977–to have at least two inspectors live nearby and work exclusively at each plant in the U.S. to provide daily surveillance of licensee adherence to NRC regulations;", "- Expanding performance-oriented as well as safety oriented inspections, and the use of risk assessment to identify vulnerabilities of any plant to severe accidents;", "- Strengthening and reorganizing enforcement staff in a separate office within the NRC;", "- Establishing the Institute of Nuclear Power Operations, the industry’s own “policing” group, and formation of what is now the Nuclear Energy Institute to provide a unified industry approach to generic nuclear regulatory issues, and interaction with NRC and other government agencies;", "- Installing additional equipment by licensees to mitigate accident conditions, and monitor radiation levels and plant status;", "- Enacting programs by licensees for early identification of important safety related problems, and for collecting and assessing relevant data so operating experience can be shared and quickly acted upon; and", "- Expanding NRC’s international activities to share enhanced knowledge of nuclear safety with other countries in a number of important technical areas.", "Today, the TMI 2 reactor is permanently shut down and 99 percent of its fuel has been removed.

Dam, blessing a controversial deal that Maryland reached with the dam’s owner over its responsibility to help clean up pollution of the Susquehanna River and Chesapeake Bay.", "The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission issued a brief press release Thursday announcing its decision to grant Exelon Corp. a new 50-year license to operate the dam, ending nearly eight years of study and debate.", "“The license includes conditions to enhance fish migration, protect bald eagles and other wildlife, upgrade 13 public recreation sites, address sediment issues and protect archaeological and historic sites,” the release said.", "The order, which has yet to be released, incorporates settlements negotiated between Exelon, the Maryland Department of the Environment and U.S. Department of the Interior.", "The deals address fish and eel passage upriver, as well as sediment and nutrient pollution flowing downriver past the dam.", "An Exelon spokeswoman said the company was waiting to see the order before commenting.", "MDE Secretary Ben Grumbles called the announcement by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission “encouraging news for the Susquehanna River and the Chesapeake Bay after almost a decade of gridlock.”", "He said state officials are “committed to working with citizens and stakeholders immediately on environmental and climate resiliency projects included in the FERC-approved settlement” and to taking additional actions as well.", "Environmentalists, however, lambasted the commission’s decision, accusing it of accepting a deal that requires far too little of Exelon to compensate for the environmental problems caused by the dam.", "“Exelon has been let off the hook, and [the] state let it happen,” said Ted Evgeniadis, the Lower Susquehanna Riverkeeper.", "“The Lower Susquehanna and the Chesapeake Bay will suffer because of today’s decision.”", "The 94-foot high dam straddles the lower Susquehanna in Maryland, about 10 miles upstream from the Bay.", "Its river-driven turbines generate enough electricity to power 165,000 homes, according to Exelon.", "But since its completion in 1928, it has effectively blocked many migratory fish from getting upriver to spawn.", "It’s likewise hampered the upriver migration of American eels, which in turn has depleted freshwater mussels that once helped filter nutrients and sediments out of the river.", "Exelon agreed nearly five years ago to upgrade its main fish lift at Conowingo to help more spawning American shad and river herring move upriver.", "But actions Exelon agreed to take, including trucking fish upriver past three other dams, were put on hold amid disputes over the company’s responsibility for cleaning up nutrient and sediment pollution passing through the dam.", "The dam also has complicated Bay restoration efforts because the 14-mile reservoir it creates has reached its capacity to trap sediment from upstream sources.", "As a result, more nutrients and sediment from farm runoff, municipal wastewater and stormwater are flowing into the Chesapeake, where they contribute to algae blooms and other water quality woes.", "And whenever a storm hits or heavy rains fall, as they did in 2018, the engorged river flushes sediment and nutrients that have built up behind the dam downriver.", "Those surges also carry trash and debris downriver to the Bay, littering shores and marinas.", "The settlement Exelon and the MDE announced in October 2019 requires the company to spend more than $200 million total over the next 50 years on projects intended to rebuild eel, mussel and migratory fish populations in the river and to reduce nutrient and sediment pollution flowing into the Upper Bay.", "But environmentalists, a coalition of rural Maryland local officials and others criticized the deal, saying it didn’t come close to dealing with the water quality issues caused by the dam.", "They appealed to the commission more than a year ago to reject the settlement and force the parties back to the negotiating table.", "Environmentalists contend that the settlement doesn’t require nearly enough from Exelon to compensate for the water quality problems and storm risks the dam poses, and that it lacks sufficient teeth to ensure that the company even does what it has promised to.", "They warn that Maryland taxpayers could be forced to pay for cleanup of pollution attributable to the dam.", "“The Susquehanna River is a public resource and should not be sold off to a private company for exclusive use without ensuring that the impacts to the public have been properly mitigated, said Betsy Nicholas, executive director of Waterkeepers Chesapeake.", "She said her group would be considering “all legal options” to protect the river and Bay in response to the commission’s action.", "You can read this story in its entirety at bayjournal.com."]}

If all of the parties accept the terms within two weeks, the PSC would automatically approve Exelon’s purchase of Pepco, with no further review or vote required.", "This set off a lot of speculation about how quickly or easily the deal would be approved. We are happy to report that hasty judgments that Exelon would quickly achieve victory are far from true.", "If even one of the nine parties backs out, the deal could be dead, or be subject to further review.", "And there are plenty of reasons for them to do it. But first a little refresher on why this is so important for those concerned about clean energy and a nuclear-free, carbon-free future.", "Exelon is by far the largest nuclear power plant operator in the country, running 23 reactors in six states and holding an ownership stake in two others, plus five shutdown reactors.", "Over one-fourth of Exelon’s reactors are unprofitable and losing millions of dollars each year, placing them at imminent risk of retirement.", "Given that nuclear power is the core of Exelon’s business, it is under pressure to boost its bottom line by whatever means necessary.", "Hence, the company is pushing legislators and regulators from Illinois to New York to DC to deliver massive subsidies for nuclear power plants.", "And it has stepped up its attacks on renewable energy in the same fashion: blocking renewable energy legislation in Illinois for the last two years, and trying to kill federal renewable energy programs.", "But Wall Street has also been telling Exelon it needs to shift away from nuclear power. And that is why, in 2014, it offered Pepco a deal it couldn’t refuse: to buy out the company and its shareholders to the tune of $6.8 billion, 25% more than the company’s stock was worth.", "Pepco was literally the best option for Exelon: with 2 million captive ratepayers, and adjacent to utilities it already owned in Pennsylvania and Maryland, Pepco would give Exelon an unprecedented regional monopoly.", "The problem: people in Maryland and DC have been fighting for renewable energy and real climate justice policies for years.", "They knew Exelon would be a disaster for consumers and the environment alike. And with vigorous grassroots organizing and legal interventions, we won round one.", "After Maryland only narrowly approved the deal (with over 50 pages of conditions), DC’s Public Service Commission rejected it in August, pointing out Exelon’s long track record opposing renewable energy, the loss of local control with a utility headquartered in Chicago, and the company’s inherent conflict of interest in selling its nuclear power at the highest price possible.", "That set off a desperate effort by Exelon and Pepco to seek out a settlement with the city government.", "The Mayor’s decision to go along with Exelon at the same time that Pepco gave the city $25 million for a soccer stadium and Exelon hired the chairman of her political action committee as a lobbyist have raised serious concerns about corruption (see the timeline below).", "If Exelon’s takeover of Pepco were the clean energy equivalent of the Titanic, then the equivalent of rearranging the deck chairs rather than heading to the lifeboats.", "The terms offered by the PSC are actually worse – even for the Mayor and other officials who joined the settlement:", "• $28 million in bill credits intended to lessen the impact of Exelon rate hikes until 2019 on residential customers are now out the window.", "PSC says it will apply the credits to all customers (businesses and government).

That would have been the case long-term anyway, but now the Mayor and others will be exposed to the political repercussions of supporting Exelon.", "So it is really down to whether Exelon’s corporate influence is more powerful than the threat of an angry electorate.", "There are other significant terms, too, including forcing Exelon to bid out micro-grid and solar projects to competitive providers, rather than being able to own and profit from them itself.", "Exelon could probably live with that. Also, the PSC’s chair, Betty Anne Kane, issued a strong and principled minority opinion opposing the terms offered by the other two commissioners.", "Kane reiterated the view that the Exelon-Pepco deal is inherently flawed, both because of the inevitable loss of local control and Exelon’s fundamental conflict of interest in being both the utility and a major nuclear generator.", "Before the PSC decisions, Exelon had said it would walk away from the deal if it wasn’t decided by March 4.", "And here is a timeline of Exelon’s and Pepco’s scandal-ridden effort to squeeze their rotten deal through.", "(Timeline compiled by NIRS and Chesapeake Climate Action Network from news reports and public documents.)", "SUMMARY OF SCANDAL-PLAGUED EVENTS LEADING UP TO FINAL EXELON-PEPCO MERGER DECISION", "April of 2015: FreshPAC launched.

Dam, blessing a controversial deal that Maryland reached with the dam’s owner over its responsibility to help clean up pollution of the Susquehanna River and Chesapeake Bay.", "The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission issued a brief press release Thursday announcing its decision to grant Exelon Corp. a new 50-year license to operate the dam, ending nearly eight years of study and debate.", "“The license includes conditions to enhance fish migration, protect bald eagles and other wildlife, upgrade 13 public recreation sites, address sediment issues and protect archaeological and historic sites,” the release said.", "The order, which has yet to be released, incorporates settlements negotiated between Exelon, the Maryland Department of the Environment and U.S. Department of the Interior.", "The deals address fish and eel passage upriver, as well as sediment and nutrient pollution flowing downriver past the dam.", "An Exelon spokeswoman said the company was waiting to see the order before commenting.", "MDE Secretary Ben Grumbles called the announcement by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission “encouraging news for the Susquehanna River and the Chesapeake Bay after almost a decade of gridlock.”", "He said state officials are “committed to working with citizens and stakeholders immediately on environmental and climate resiliency projects included in the FERC-approved settlement” and to taking additional actions as well.", "Environmentalists, however, lambasted the commission’s decision, accusing it of accepting a deal that requires far too little of Exelon to compensate for the environmental problems caused by the dam.", "“Exelon has been let off the hook, and [the] state let it happen,” said Ted Evgeniadis, the Lower Susquehanna Riverkeeper.", "“The Lower Susquehanna and the Chesapeake Bay will suffer because of today’s decision.”", "The 94-foot high dam straddles the lower Susquehanna in Maryland, about 10 miles upstream from the Bay.", "Its river-driven turbines generate enough electricity to power 165,000 homes, according to Exelon.", "But since its completion in 1928, it has effectively blocked many migratory fish from getting upriver to spawn.", "It’s likewise hampered the upriver migration of American eels, which in turn has depleted freshwater mussels that once helped filter nutrients and sediments out of the river.", "Exelon agreed nearly five years ago to upgrade its main fish lift at Conowingo to help more spawning American shad and river herring move upriver.", "But actions Exelon agreed to take, including trucking fish upriver past three other dams, were put on hold amid disputes over the company’s responsibility for cleaning up nutrient and sediment pollution passing through the dam.", "The dam also has complicated Bay restoration efforts because the 14-mile reservoir it creates has reached its capacity to trap sediment from upstream sources.", "As a result, more nutrients and sediment from farm runoff, municipal wastewater and stormwater are flowing into the Chesapeake, where they contribute to algae blooms and other water quality woes.", "And whenever a storm hits or heavy rains fall, as they did in 2018, the engorged river flushes sediment and nutrients that have built up behind the dam downriver.", "Those surges also carry trash and debris downriver to the Bay, littering shores and marinas.", "The settlement Exelon and the MDE announced in October 2019 requires the company to spend more than $200 million total over the next 50 years on projects intended to rebuild eel, mussel and migratory fish populations in the river and to reduce nutrient and sediment pollution flowing into the Upper Bay.", "But environmentalists, a coalition of rural Maryland local officials and others criticized the deal, saying it didn’t come close to dealing with the water quality issues caused by the dam.", "They appealed to the commission more than a year ago to reject the settlement and force the parties back to the negotiating table.", "Environmentalists contend that the settlement doesn’t require nearly enough from Exelon to compensate for the water quality problems and storm risks the dam poses, and that it lacks sufficient teeth to ensure that the company even does what it has promised to.", "They warn that Maryland taxpayers could be forced to pay for cleanup of pollution attributable to the dam.", "“The Susquehanna River is a public resource and should not be sold off to a private company for exclusive use without ensuring that the impacts to the public have been properly mitigated, said Betsy Nicholas, executive director of Waterkeepers Chesapeake.", "She said her group would be considering “all legal options” to protect the river and Bay in response to the commission’s action.", "You can read this story in its entirety at bayjournal.com."]}

In a complex decision that almost literally gave those of us in the room whiplash, the Public Service Commission:", "• Rejected a controversial deal submitted by the corporations and DC’s Mayor, Muriel Bowser, and agreed to by several other parties.", "• And then immediately after, the commission offered amended terms by a 2-1 vote. If all of the parties accept the terms within two weeks, the PSC would automatically approve Exelon’s purchase of Pepco, with no further review or vote required.", "This set off a lot of speculation about how quickly or easily the deal would be approved. We are happy to report that hasty judgments that Exelon would quickly achieve victory are far from true.", "If even one of the nine parties backs out, the deal could be dead, or be subject to further review.", "And there are plenty of reasons for them to do it. But first a little refresher on why this is so important for those concerned about clean energy and a nuclear-free, carbon-free future.", "Exelon is by far the largest nuclear power plant operator in the country, running 23 reactors in six states and holding an ownership stake in two others, plus five shutdown reactors.", "Over one-fourth of Exelon’s reactors are unprofitable and losing millions of dollars each year, placing them at imminent risk of retirement.", "Given that nuclear power is the core of Exelon’s business, it is under pressure to boost its bottom line by whatever means necessary.", "Hence, the company is pushing legislators and regulators from Illinois to New York to DC to deliver massive subsidies for nuclear power plants.", "And it has stepped up its attacks on renewable energy in the same fashion: blocking renewable energy legislation in Illinois for the last two years, and trying to kill federal renewable energy programs.", "But Wall Street has also been telling Exelon it needs to shift away from nuclear power. And that is why, in 2014, it offered Pepco a deal it couldn’t refuse: to buy out the company and its shareholders to the tune of $6.8 billion, 25% more than the company’s stock was worth.", "Pepco was literally the best option for Exelon: with 2 million captive ratepayers, and adjacent to utilities it already owned in Pennsylvania and Maryland, Pepco would give Exelon an unprecedented regional monopoly.", "The problem: people in Maryland and DC have been fighting for renewable energy and real climate justice policies for years.", "They knew Exelon would be a disaster for consumers and the environment alike. And with vigorous grassroots organizing and legal interventions, we won round one.", "After Maryland only narrowly approved the deal (with over 50 pages of conditions), DC’s Public Service Commission rejected it in August, pointing out Exelon’s long track record opposing renewable energy, the loss of local control with a utility headquartered in Chicago, and the company’s inherent conflict of interest in selling its nuclear power at the highest price possible.", "That set off a desperate effort by Exelon and Pepco to seek out a settlement with the city government.", "The Mayor’s decision to go along with Exelon at the same time that Pepco gave the city $25 million for a soccer stadium and Exelon hired the chairman of her political action committee as a lobbyist have raised serious concerns about corruption (see the timeline below).", "If Exelon’s takeover of Pepco were the clean energy equivalent of the Titanic, then the equivalent of rearranging the deck chairs rather than heading to the lifeboats.", "The terms offered by the PSC are actually worse – even for the Mayor and other officials who joined the settlement:", "• $28 million in bill credits intended to lessen the impact of Exelon rate hikes until 2019 on residential customers are now out the window.", "PSC says it will apply the credits to all customers (businesses and government). Residential customers would see their bills go up long before the Mayor’s re-election campaign in 2018.", "• $9 million toward low-income customer assistance, also gone.", "• Other monies that the Mayor would have had the discretion to spend on renewable energy projects (or not) would now be under the PSC’s authority, to prevent the Mayor from diverting them to other budgetary purposes.", "These happen to be the very terms district officials were using to justify their support for the deal.", "Without them, Exelon’s rate hikes mean nothing but misery to district ratepayers. That would have been the case long-term anyway, but now the Mayor and others will be exposed to the political repercussions of supporting Exelon.", "So it is really down to whether Exelon’s corporate influence is more powerful than the threat of an angry electorate.", "There are other significant terms, too, including forcing Exelon to bid out micro-grid and solar projects to competitive providers, rather than being able to own and profit from them itself.", "Exelon could probably live with that. Also, the PSC’s chair, Betty Anne Kane, issued a strong and principled minority opinion opposing the terms offered by the other two commissioners.", "Kane reiterated the view that the Exelon-Pepco deal is inherently flawed, both because of the inevitable loss of local control and Exelon’s fundamental conflict of interest in being both the utility and a major nuclear generator.", "Before the PSC decisions, Exelon had said it would walk away from the deal if it wasn’t decided by March 4.", "And here is a timeline of Exelon’s and Pepco’s scandal-ridden effort to squeeze their rotten deal through.", "(Timeline compiled by NIRS and Chesapeake Climate Action Network from news reports and public documents.)", "SUMMARY OF SCANDAL-PLAGUED EVENTS LEADING UP TO FINAL EXELON-PEPCO MERGER DECISION", "April of 2015: FreshPAC launched.

Researchers have not been able to find another deal like it in the country.", "Not only is all the money paid up front, at a very high price (proportionally more than the Verizon Center naming rights deal), but the brevity and minimized complexity of the two-page legal agreement is virtually unprecedented.", "September 19, 2015: Exelon presents merger “settlement” financial terms the day after “Soccergate” payment.", "Documents released under the Freedom of Information Act show that, the very next day after the soccer deal, Exelon submits new financial information to the Mayor’s office for settlement purposes.", "November 10, 2015: FreshPAC is disbanded after widespread criticism. Critics charged it represented a pay-to-play PAC that tarnished DC politics and the Mayor’s public integrity.", "Exelon continues to refuse to say whether it was asked to donate to FreshPAC while working with the Mayor’s office on a settlement that would give the company its prized $6.8 billion merger.", "December 16, 2015: WAMU reveals that former FreshPAC chair registered to lobby for Exelon on the merger.", "News breaks that Chico Horton, the director of FreshPAC, registered to lobby for Exelon on the merger on September 30, 2015 – the same time that Exelon was negotiating a settlement with the mayor and while FreshPAC was still active and soliciting huge donations from businesses.", "January 2016: Chico Horton, the Exelon lobbyist, says he did no “lobbying.” The former head of Bowser’s FreshPAC declares that he did no lobbying – zero – for Exelon during the intense autumn negotiations between Exelon and the Mayor’s office, despite registering as an Exelon lobbyist.", "Horton said he simply gave the company “strategic advice” that did not officially constitute lobbying.", "February 2016: Documents indicate Mayor’s office misled the public on merger negotiations. Documents released under the Freedom of Information Act indicate that the Mayor’s office repeatedly misled the public as to who in her administration actually coordinated and led the merger settlement negotiations between the city and Exelon.", "The Mayor claimed and still claims that City Administrator Rashad Young and Tommy Wells, head of the Department of the Environment and Energy, led the negotiations.", "But FOIA documents show that they were informed of key settlement terms after the deal had been negotiated by others close to the Mayor.", "Who actually led those talks, and what connection to Exelon or Pepco the city negotiators might have had, is still not known.", "But it was not Wells or Young, as was claimed. Why the discrepancy?", "February 26, 2016: PSC gives conditional approval to the merger. Little substantive changes were required on top of the Mayor’s wholly inadequate settlement.", "Opponents assert the merger is still a fundamental “conflict of interest” and the process was clearly influenced by big-money “pay-to-play” politics.", "Permalink: https://www.nirs.org/one-more-chance-to-defeat-exelon/", "Your contributions make publication of GreenWorld possible.

I have a comment about CS5 and editing natively with H.264.", "I keep hearing from pro editors that editing in H.264 will degrade your quality as you do further editing in post.", "It’s very destructive like re-saving a .jpeg.

Cineform is also an amazingly good compressed or uncompressed intermediate codec that rivals Pro Res and DNX and works great with CS5 on both Mac and PC.", "If you have Final Cut Pro on your MAC, you can choose to export all the various flavors of Pro Res through our Media Encoder, if that works better for you.", "Then, and only then in the process would you want to choose it as an output option. Converting your files to Pro Res beforehand for use in Adobe CS5 works great, but will not take full advantage of all the image processing that we offer by working natively in H.264.", "What you NEVER want to do though is to output H.264 as an intermediate. As the blogger mentions, yes…it would be like re-compressing an already compressed format…like saving a JPEG as a JPEG again.", "One caveat here is for the PC folks…Adobe can’t directly output Pro Res through the Media Encoder on Windows for obvious reasons (Final Cut is only for MAC), and that is where the Pro Res codec is supplied.", "So if you are on a PC, I recommend that you use uncompressed 10 bit DPX output as an intermediate (now available in Premiere Pro’s 5.0.2 free update which includes timecode support), a Cineform workflow, or use AJA’s KiPRO in conjunction with Adobe CS5 to layoff your finished timeline to Pro Res through this amazing and affordable device.”", "Are you going to blog about the mexico tourism spot?

The deferred tax would be financially similar to a 0% borrowing note.", "By reinvesting it, Unicom could receive a significant yield premium. Moreover, leveraging the new lease in such a manner would leave Unicom in substantially the same cash position.", "The PwC strategy envisioned a lease term in the range of 20-25 years with an \"enhancement and defeasance structure providing for AA rated or better enhancement of the lessee's entire financial obligations to Unicom.\"", "PwC compared the costs for maintaining the new lease investment with maintaining a typical debt private placement.", "Under the strategy, Unicom would lease the exchange assets to the lessee under a triple net lease with an end-of-term fixed purchase option.", "Unicom would pass on a portion of its tax deferral benefit to the lessees through a reduction in rental obligation.", "The lessee would \"defease its rental obligations, and thereby monetize the lower rental cost into an upfront cash benefit.\"", "The final structure of the like-kind exchange and sale-leaseback was different, as explained further in this Opinion.", "PwC pointed out to petitioner that municipal utilities and rural electric cooperatives seeking to monetize tax benefits they could not use because of their tax-exempt status would be interested in entering into a sale-leaseback transaction.", "PwC also suggested that taxable entities desiring to obtain low cost/off-balance-sheet financing alternatives might also be interested.", "After the initial consultation with PwC, Mr. Roling decided to present the idea of the like-kind exchange to his superiors.", "IV. Unicom's Decision To Enter Into the Test Transactions", "Mr. Roling first presented the PwC strategy to Mr. Berdelle. Although Mr. Berdelle initially did not fully understand the strategy, he decided it had promise and was in line with Unicom's tax strategy.", "John C. Bukovski, the chief financial officer of Unicom, gave Mr. Roling permission to move forward with the like-kind exchange strategy and present it to the Unicom's board of directors for consideration and approval.", "On October 5, 1999, two months after receiving ICC approval to sell ComEd's fossil fuel power plants, ComEd submitted a notice to the ICC stating that it was considering entering into a like-kind exchange for at least several of the fossil fuel power plants.", "On October 14, 1999, Unicom and PwC executed an agreement whereby Unicom retained PwC to act as its financial adviser in connection with the proposed like-kind exchange strategy.", "On October 20, 1999, Mr. Berdelle provided information on the strategy to Unicom's board of directors.", "He presented the strategy during the board meeting held on October 27, 1999, seeking and receiving approval for various preliminary steps necessary to pursue the concept and preserve the option of entering into a like-kind exchange transaction.", "Mr. Berdelle assembled a team to further evaluate the like-kind exchange opportunity. That team consisted of a number of Unicom's employees from various departments, including the tax department, treasury and finance departments, engineers, and outside consultants.", "Core members of the team, including Mr. Berdelle, Robert Hanley, a tax department employee, and Mr. Roling, would meet weekly, if not more often, to discuss the status of the project.", "Neither Mr. Roling nor anyone on his staff in the tax department had any experience with like-kind exchanges.", "Because Unicom did not have the internal expertise necessary to adequately assess all of the legal and technical aspects of the proposed like-kind exchange, Unicom employed a number of consultants and advisers to work on the project, including performing due diligence of potential replacement properties.", "Unicom retained a Chicago law firm, Winston & Strawn LLP (Winston & Strawn) to advise on the legal aspects of the transaction, including its tax consequences.", "In addition, in March or April of 2000 Unicom engaged Stone & Webster Management Consultants, Inc. (Stone & Webster), to provide engineering and environmental reports on prospective replacement properties.", "Unicom retained Deloitte to conduct an appraisal of the relinquished properties and potential replacement properties in November 1999.", "In addition, petitioner engaged PwC (financial and accounting adviser), Arthur Andersen (accounting adviser), Sidley Austin (regulatory counsel), Vinson & Elkins (Texas counsel), and Holland & Knight (Georgia counsel).", "V. Identification of Properties To be Relinquished in the Like-Kind Exchange", "On or about December 9, 1999, six days before the closing of the sale under the EME agreement, Unicom identified the Collins and Powerton stations as the properties it would try to exchange for like-kind replacement properties.", "Mr. Roling concluded, on the basis of the valuations from Deloitte, that the fair market value of the Collins station at that time was $930 million, with an expected taxable gain of $823 million, while the fair market value of Powerton station was $870 million, with an expected taxable gain of $683 million.", "Unicom did not plan to execute a like-kind exchange for any of the other fossil fuel power plants it was selling.", "VI. Identification of Like-Kind Replacement Properties and Due Diligence", "Because section 1031 has a strict timeframe for identification--on or before the 45th day after the date on which the relinquished property is transferred--and acquisition of replacement property--within 180 days of the date on which the relinquished property is transferred (or, if earlier, the transferor's tax return due date for the year in which the transfer of the relinquished property occurs)--Unicom started looking for potential replacement properties before the closing of the sale under the EME agreement.", "By November 1999 PwC had identified 26 prospective lessees. Unicom did not participate in the initial identification process.", "On or about November 9-10, 1999, PwC, on behalf of Unicom, sent proposals to a number of potential lessees for the sale-leaseback portion of the like-kind exchange.", "PwC contacted both taxable and tax-exempt entities.

According to Dr. Skinner, here, where both CPS and MEAG are tax-exempt entities, their cashflows are about 40% higher than the cashflows Deloitte assumes, significantly increasing the value of the assets at the sublease termination dates.", "Second, Dr. Skinner concluded that Deloitte also applied too high a discount rate to these cashflows, further reducing the estimated value of the assets.", "Dr. Skinner recalculated the value of each asset using Deloitte's cashflows and applying a 0% tax rate and lower discount rates of 6.1% for Spruce and 6.3% for Wansley and Scherer.", "His calculations show an estimated value for each asset at the sublease expiration date that is substantially higher than the cancellation/purchase option exercise price.", "Thus, Dr. Skinner concluded that it was nearly certain that CPS and MEAG will exercise their respective cancellation/purchase options at the end of the sublease terms, allowing Exelon to obtain the option proceeds without ever bearing any significant risk of loss.", "In addition Dr. Skinner opined that CPS and MEAG would be economically compelled to exercise their cancellation/purchase options because of the \"onerous\" conditions they would face if they did not exercise their respective options.", "Dr. Skinner in his expert report shows that, absent tax benefits available under section 1031, Exelon would never recover its initial investment in the lease.", "Thus, Dr. Skinner concluded that Exelon would be able to generate a positive return from the transactions only because of the tax benefits.", "The Court recognized Christopher Knittel as an expert in energy and environmental economics, industrial organization, and regulation.", "Dr. Knittel is the William Barton Rogers professor of energy economics in the Sloan School of Management at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.", "He has a Ph.D. in economics from the University of California at Berkeley.

Lessee had an option to purchase the building at certain times during the lease and at the end of the 25-year lease term.", "Lessee also had an option to renew the lease for additional periods of time. Frank Lyon claimed depreciation deductions and interest expense deductions related to the building.", "After considering the transaction, the Supreme Court held that the form of a sale-leaseback transaction will be respected for Federal tax purposes as long as the lessor retains significant and genuine attributes of a traditional lessor.", "Id. at 584. The Supreme Court recognized that these attributes necessarily depend on the facts of a particular case.", "Id. According to the Supreme Court, several factors weighed in favor of the taxpayer in Frank Lyon. Frank Lyon bore the financial risks of the transaction by assuming responsibility for loan repayment and investing its own money in the transaction.", "Id. at 581. The Supreme Court concluded that there was a real possibility that the lessor could walk away from the transaction at the end of the initial lease.", "The parties negotiated the deal in good faith and were independent of each other. The parties paid the same tax rates, making the transaction tax neutral.", "The rent and purchase option prices were reasonable, and Frank Lyon assumed the credit risk of the lessee's defaulting on its rent payments.", "Around the time the Supreme Court issued its ruling in Frank Lyon, the Government was working on developing a set of rules to determine whether a leveraged lease transaction is a true lease or something else.", "In 1975 the Commissioner issued guidelines for advance ruling purposes on whether a leveraged lease will be respected for Federal tax purposes as a lease.", "Rev.

L. No. 98-369, sec. 31, 98 Stat. at 509.", "The unintended consequence of the Pickle rule was the proliferation of LILO transactions with tax-exempt entities.", "LILO transactions were designed to work around the Pickle rule because the taxable party leased the property from the tax-exempt counterparty instead of buying it, and then immediately subleased it back to the tax-exempt entity.", "To fund the transaction, the taxable party typically took out a nonrecourse loan covering 80%-90% of the initial lease.", "See John Hancock Life Ins. Co. (U.S.A.) v. Commissioner, 141 T.C. at 11.", "The sublease to a tax-exempt entity would typically be shorter than the initial lease term. At the end of the sublease, the tax-exempt entity usually has the option to purchase the remainder of the leasehold interest in the initial lease.", "Even if the tax-exempt entity decides not to exercise its purchase option, the taxable party could still compel the tax-exempt entity to renew the sublease, take possession of the asset, or procure the replacement sublease.", "To return the asset to the taxable party, the tax-exempt entity would typically need to meet certain conditions, including refinancing the nonrecourse loan involved in the transactions.", "Failure to meet the return conditions meant that the tax-exempt entity had to exercise the purchase option.", "In 1999 LILO transactions became less popular because of a change in the regulations under section 467, which required that prepayment of the initial lease rent be treated as a loan for tax purposes.", "Id. at 16; see also sec. 1.467-4, Income Tax Regs. After that, investors started using SILOs to obtain similar results.", "See John Hancock Life Ins. Co. (U.S.A.) v.

Thus, the trial court used the wrong legal standard in determining whether ConEd acquired benefits and burdens of ownership in the ConEd LILO.", "Id. The Court of Appeals clarified that the relevant standard was whether there was a reasonable likelihood that the purchase option at the end of the sublease period would be exercised, not whether this outcome was \"certain\" or \"virtually certain\".", "The Court of Appeals concluded that the analysis performed by Deloitte for the ConEd LILO was \"boilerplate\" and was insufficient to support ConEd's claims.", "Id. at 1378-1379. The Court of Appeals noted that Richard Ellsworth, who prepared the appraisal for the ConEd LILO, admitted at trial that Deloitte \"never once found that there was 'economic compulsion' to exercise a purchase option\" in about a hundred appraisal reports prepared for LILO transactions.", "Id. at 1380. The Court of Appeals commented that the appraisal failed in several respects, including not considering noneconomic factors, defeasance of funds for the purchase option payment, and the costs to EZH that would result from ConEd's exercise of the renewal or retention options.", "After considering the arguments of the parties in ConEd II, the Court of Appeals concluded that \"EZH was reasonably likely to exercise the purchase option *", "* * [and] ConEd has failed to show that the substance of the transaction included a genuine leasehold interest in which ConEd would bear the benefits and burdens of a lease transaction.\"", "Id. at 1381.

The Court considered seven test transactions, including three LILOs and four SILOs (John Hancock test transactions).", "John Hancock invested in SILOs and LILOs primarily as a means to diversify its investments in domestic and international assets to provide it with sufficient cashflow.", "Id. at 8. All of the John Hancock test transactions had a typical structure for LILOs and SILOs, featuring a set of agreements including a headlease, a sublease with a fixed purchase option at the end, and various defeasance arrangements.", "The Court considered the application of both the economic substance doctrine and the substance over form doctrine to the John Hancock test transactions: \"In order to conclude that John Hancock is entitled to its claimed deductions, we must determine both that the test transactions have economic substance and that the substance of each test transaction is consistent with its form.", "There is no clear formula by which to answer these questions, nor do we attempt to create one.\" Id. at 78.", "The Court analyzed both objective and subjective sides of the John Hancock test transactions and concluded that they satisfied the economic substance inquiry because John Hancock had a realistic expectation of profit and a business purpose when entering into the transactions.", "To determine whether the John Hancock test transactions' form was consistent with their substance, the Court followed the same analysis the Supreme Court used in Frank Lyon for leveraged leases.", "Id. at 89-90 (citing Frank Lyon, 435 U.S. at 584).

Commissioner, 141 T.C. at 89-90.", "After discussing various factors previously considered in other cases, the Court reiterated its commitment to evaluate the John Hancock test transactions on the basis of the overall facts and circumstances in determining whether the substance of the transactions was consistent with their form.", "Id. at 90-91 (citing Levy v.

The inquiry into the likelihood of purchase option exercise is determinative because if the original property holder is reasonably expected to exercise the purchase option at the end of the sublease, the obligations of the parties under SILO/LILO would offset each other, so that a taxpayer would be insulated from any economic risk of loss and would not be able to take advantage of any potential gain.", "Id. at 94. Instead, a taxpayer would be guaranteed a fixed return on its investment at the end of a sublease term.", "This would indicate that the taxpayer did not obtain any benefits or burdens associated with the leasehold or ownership interest transferred in a SILO/LILO.", "For the LILO transactions in John Hancock, the Court concluded that \"any legal, political, industrial, or technical objections to the nonexercise of the purchase options can be overcome, and thus are not determinative of whether [the LILO counterparty] is reasonably likely to exercise its purchase option.\"", "John Hancock Life Ins. Co. (U.S.A.) v. Commissioner, 141 T.C. at 99, 107. Thus, the Court based its ultimate conclusion primarily on financial analysis, including a comparison of the costs of the purchase option and alternative end-of-sublease options.", "In all LILO test transactions, the Court concluded that it was reasonably likely that the LILO counterparties would exercise their respective purchase options.", "Id. at 109-110. The Court came to the same conclusion for one of the SILO transactions, the SNCB SILO.", "Id. at 145. Thus, the Court held that the substance of all the LILO and SNCB SILO transactions was inconsistent with their form and that these transactions resembled loans because John Hancock did not acquire genuine attributes of ownership or leasehold interest.", "Id. at 109-110, 145. As a result, the Court held that John Hancock was not entitled to rental expense and depreciation deductions related to these transactions.", "Id. at 109-110, 145. The Court also disallowed the interest expense for the nonrecourse loans John Hancock took out to finance the transactions.", "Id. at 146-147. Further, the Court recharacterized the equity contributions into these transactions as a loan giving rise to the original issue discount (OID) income.", "Id. at 148. The Court held that pursuant to section 1.1273-2(g)(4), Income Tax Regs., John Hancock's transaction costs with respect to LILOs and the SNCB SILO must be included as an additional amount lent to borrowers and are not deductible under section 162.", "For the remaining SILO transactions, the Court concluded, after considering financial analyses presented by the parties and various nonfinancial constraints, that exercising the purchase option at the end of the sublease was not the only financially viable alternative for the SILO counterparties.", "Id. at 123, 131-132. According to the appraisals, the projected fair market value of the assets involved in the remaining SILOs was going to be substantially lower than the purchase option exercise price.", "Id. at 114-115, 123-124. Thus, the Court assumed that these options would not be exercised and proceeded with the analysis of whether John Hancock had any economic risk after the end of the sublease and until the end of the lease.", "The Court then concluded that John Hancock indeed faced economic risks indicative of ownership during that period under the service contract option because any payments under that option were not guaranteed.", "Id. at 132-135. Thus, the Commissioner did not succeed with the substance-over-form argument for these remaining transactions.", "With respect to the remaining SILO transactions, the Court held that John Hancock acquired a future interest in the transferred assets and was thus not entitled to depreciation deductions before the purchase option exercise date.", "John Hancock Ins. Co. (U.S.A.) v. Commissioner, 141 T.C. at 137. Because John Hancock had only future interest in the assets, the Court disallowed any interest deductions as well.", "Id. at 147.

Unlike parties in traditional LILO/SILO transactions, petitioner did not use any loans to pay the Spruce headlease rent.", "Instead, it paid with the proceeds of a recent sale of its own power plant. CPS returned only 76.9% of the headlease rent to prepay the rent during the Spruce sublease term.", "Petitioner argues that the 23.1% CPS retained after prepayment of the Spruce sublease rent satisfies any equity tests derived from judicial decisions and administrative guidance.", "Second, petitioner maintains that the rights and obligations conveyed by the Spruce headlease and sublease agreements are typical of traditional leases and significantly alter the rights of the parties.", "Specifically, petitioner cites the necessity for CPS to obtain consent for improvements that could have a material impact on the value of the subleased property.", "Third, petitioner points to its extensive due diligence efforts as indicative of obtaining a true ownership interest in the Spruce station.", "Finally, petitioner claims that it was exposed to a significant risk of loss in case of CPS' bankruptcy and sublease rejection because of the limitations of section 502(b)(6) of the Bankruptcy Code.", "We begin with an observation that what made SILO and LILO transactions abusive was not only the amount of equity invested by the parties entering into such transactions but rather the circular flow of money such transactions created.", "As the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit explained in Wells Fargo, 641 F.3d at 1330:", "[W]e are left with purely circular transactions that elevate form over substance. The only flow of funds between the parties to the transaction was the initial lump sum given to the tax-exempt entity as compensation for its participation in the transaction.", "From the tax-exempt entity's point of view, the transaction effectively ended as soon as it began. The benefits to Wells Fargo continued to flow throughout the term of the sublease, however, in the form of deferred tax payments.", "The third-party lender and its affiliate were also compensated for their participation, as were the creators and promoters of the transactions.", "These transactions were win-win situations for all of the parties involved because free money--in the form of previously unavailable tax benefits utilized by Wells Fargo--was divided among all parties.", "The money was not entirely \"free,\" of course, because it was in effect transferred to Wells Fargo from the public fisc.", "Here, the funds necessary to fund the headlease rent came from the untaxed proceeds of the Collins power plant sale by petitioner.", "In addition to attempting to reap the benefits of long-term tax deferral under the section 1031 rules for like- kind exchanges, petitioner claimed various tax deductions associated with its participation in the Spruce, Scherer, and Wansley transactions.", "Unlike the taxpayer in Frank Lyon, which entered into a sale-leaseback with another taxable entity such that the transaction was tax neutral as a result, petitioner entered into a transaction with a tax-exempt entity.", "This would allow petitioner to double-dip into the tax benefits by deferring the tax under section 1031 and using deductions related to the test transactions.", "The structure of the cashflows in the Spruce transaction guaranteed the return of 76.9% of petitioner's initial investment just six months after the closing date in the form of rent prepayment under the Spruce sublease.", "During that period, CPS obtained credit enhancements to secure the payment of the rent. The rest of petitioner's investment was either used to pay the accommodation fee to CPS in the form of the NPV benefit or set aside pursuant to the Spruce CPUA to secure the payments of the stipulated loss value during the period of the Spruce sublease or the payment of the purchase option price at the end of the sublease.", "CPS obtained credit enhancement and insurance for the CPUA from AIG, and the interest rate risk was also insured.", "Thus, similarly to traditional SILOs or LILOs, the Spruce transaction created a circular flow of money accompanied by a transfer of tax benefits from a tax-exempt to a taxable entity.", "See Wells Fargo, 641 F.3d at 1330. In addition, the terms of the Spruce transaction ensured that only six months into the deal petitioner would be in the same cash position as if it had taken out a loan to finance the transaction, similar to traditional SILOs and LILOs.", "In effect, CPS did not have any control over petitioner's investment after the closing of the transaction with the exception of the NPV benefit, which was CPS' reward for entering into the Spruce transaction.", "Accordingly, we are not persuaded by petitioner's argument that a 100% upfront out-of-pocket investment precludes the finding that any of the test transactions were abusive.", "We also disagree with petitioner's argument that the Spruce headlease or sublease somehow significantly altered the parties' rights and obligations with respect to the Spruce station.", "Under the Spruce headlease, petitioner did not have any obligations to CPS in respect of the maintenance, operation, or insurance of the Spruce station during the sublease term or the remainder of the headlease.", "If petitioner were to return the Spruce station to CPS at the end of the headlease or if the headlease was terminated, it was not required to meet any return conditions except making sure the Spruce station was free from petitioner's liens.", "Under the terms of the Spruce sublease, CPS accepted all the risks related to the operation of the Spruce station throughout the sublease term.", "CPS also agreed to observe certain maintenance and operating standards, subleasing restrictions, assignment rights, restrictions and requirements pertaining to alterations and modifications, environmental compliance, and minimum insurance coverage.", "These restrictions were designed to insulate petitioner's risk during the sublease term and ensure that in the worst case scenario--if CPS does not exercise its cancellation option at the end of the sublease--the Spruce station would be in good working condition.", "In short, CPS merely agreed to operate the station during the sublease term in the same manner a reasonable owner would.", "Similar to John Hancock, there is no evidence that before the closing date CPS was not already adhering to the same operating, maintenance, or environmental standards.", "See John Hancock Life Ins. Co. (U.S.A.) v. Commissioner, 141 T.C. at 113. Petitioner's expert Prof. McDermott also concluded that the contractual terms of the test transactions mitigated many risks of ownership, including technological obsolescence, failure of utility assets, long-term market value changes, failure of payments, and changes in Government or regulatory requirements.", "With respect to sublease and assignment restrictions, CPS could always ask petitioner for consent, the same as for improvements that could materially affect the value of the leased property.", "In fact, in 2004, when CPS decided to build Spruce II, which would share the site and some facilities with the Spruce station, petitioner gave its consent after a short site visit and receipt of a written confirmation from CPS that the construction was not going to affect the Spruce station value.", "Petitioner did not bother to visit the site after Spruce II was finally completed and started to work.", "Next, we do not find that petitioner's own due diligence efforts are indicative of any ownership rights.", "Respondent points out that petitioner had to complete the due diligence process within the strict time limits imposed by section 1031.", "As a result, petitioner did not follow up on certain red flags raised in engineering reports. Moreover, Mr. Roling and others in petitioner's tax department only cursorily reviewed the tax opinion packages prepared by Winston & Strawn.", "Mr. Berdelle, who testified that he read the entire Winston & Strawn tax opinion, did not act on or inquire about inconsistencies therein of which petitioner was, or should have been, aware.", "In most prior SILO/LILO cases taxpayers also engaged in extensive due diligence before to entering into the transactions, including hiring prominent law firms to draft documents, accounting firms to structure transactions and provide appraisals, and engineering firms to evaluate the properties.", "See, e.g., ConEd I, 90 Fed.

Petitioner's claim is inconsistent with the record and is a mere attempt to blow out of proportion the risk of loss in the event of CPS' bankruptcy.", "First, according to FCLC, petitioner's credit adviser, CPS was generally very creditworthy. FCLC opined that the payment obligations and associated risks had been effectively identified and supported by credit enhancements so even in the case of CPS' bankruptcy petitioner would be able to fully recover its investments from the credit enhancement providers.", "In 2000 CPS had one of the highest credit ratings in the country, and had cash on hand of over $450 million and a reserve fund surety policy in excess of $225 million.", "The City of San Antonio itself would have to file for bankruptcy before CPS became bankrupt. As of 2000 there had never been a failure of a major municipality in the history of the State of Texas.", "PwC explained that there was \"bulletproof assurance\" to Unicom that there was no practical exposure to loss during the first nine months of the CPS transaction, and that CPS' going bankrupt within the first six months of the transaction was commercially impossible.", "In addition, CPS obtained sufficient credit enhancements to secure the risk of rent nonpayment or early sublease termination.", "We find that petitioner's speculations on what might happen if CPS filed for bankruptcy do not add anything of substance to our analysis.", "No transaction is absolutely protected from all possible risks, including catastrophic economic events or destruction of property \"by a biblical flood or a superbolide meteor\".", "UnionBanCal Corp., 113 Fed. Cl. at 135. The record here supports respondent's argument that petitioner faced a risk of loss only in such a catastrophic event.", "We do not consider this risk sufficient to hold that petitioner had genuine attributes of ownership during the Spruce sublease term.", "Petitioner's own expert Mr. McDermott stated in his expert report that the bankruptcy of a municipal utility is a relatively low-probability event but has occurred in other jurisdictions.", "We also find that petitioner was sufficiently protected from the risk of economic loss if the Spruce sublease terminated early.", "The sublease agreement contained provisions that guaranteed that petitioner would receive stipulated loss value payments in the event of CPS' default.", "These payments were predetermined and set forth in a schedule to the Spruce sublease agreement. The payments would be made out of the funds set aside at the closing date pursuant to the CPUA.", "Petitioner argues that in case of an early Spruce sublease termination petitioner would have to return any unaccrued prepaid rent to CPS.", "This argument ignores the fact that after netting the unaccrued prepaid rent and the stipulated loss value, petitioner would still recover its full investment in the lease, including transaction fees and interest through the time of default.", "As Mr. Berdelle explained in a memorandum prepared for the Unicom board meeting on April 4, 2000, requesting the approval of the like-kind exchange plan,", "[t]he stipulated loss values also include additional earnings protection of about $3 million per each $100 million of initial investment.", "example, if there was a default on both the MEAG and CPS transactions (about $1.6 billion), Unicom would receive its investment and about $48 million pretax income in the year of default as earnings protection.", "The Spruce transaction documents were drafted to reflect this understanding. We are thus satisfied that petitioner did not face any significant risks indicative of genuine ownership during the Spruce sublease term.", "We next consider whether petitioner acquired the benefits and burdens of ownership in the light of the options available to petitioner and CPS at the end of the Spruce sublease period.", "First, we decide whether CPS was reasonably expected to exercise its cancellation option at the end of the Spruce sublease period.", "If it was, petitioner's profit was fixed at the outset of the Spruce transaction and petitioner did not acquire any benefits and burdens of ownership with respect to the Spruce station.", "See John Hancock Life Ins. Co. (U.S.A.) v. Commissioner, 141 T.C. at 139-143.", "Petitioner relies primarily on the Deloitte Spruce appraisal to show that CPS was not \"economically compelled\" to exercise the cancellation option at the end of the Spruce sublease.", "This is so, as petitioner sees it, because the cancellation option price was set above the expected future fair market value of the Spruce plant at the end of the Spruce sublease term.", "To support the Deloitte appraisal findings, petitioner invited several experts to submit expert reports and testify during the trial.", "Respondent relies primarily on the analyses of Dr. Skinner to argue that because CPS is a tax-exempt entity, it valued the Spruce station at a much higher level.", "Dr. Skinner asserts that there are a number of flaws with the Deloitte appraisal, including the very high corporate income tax rate and discount rate.", "Dr. Skinner suggested that because CPS was a tax-exempt entity, it would be more appropriate to use a 0% corporate income tax rate and a discount rate equal to CPS' weighted average cost of capital, about 6.1%.", "This would result in a much higher projected value for the Spruce plant at the expiration of the sublease.", "Dr. Skinner explained that because CPS did not pay dividends to its shareholders, the appropriate weighted average cost of capital should be based on the interest CPS usually paid on its bonds.", "At the beginning of our analysis, we specify what constitutes \"reasonable likelihood\" that a purchase option will be exercised at the end of the sublease period.", "We reiterate that this Court does not require an \"inevitable\", \"economically compelled\", or similar threshold for purchase option exercise likelihood in evaluating SILO/LILO transactions.", "See id. at 95-97.

Cl. 228 (2009), rev'd and remanded, 703 F.3d 1367 (Fed.", "Cir. 2013), seems to use a \"more likely than not\" standard in its actual analysis. See UnionBanCal Corp. v. United States, 113 Fed.", "Petitioner asserts that the Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit compared the option exercise price to the anticipated fair market value of the leased assets expected as of the closing of the lease in determining whether a transaction constitutes a true lease.", "See, e.g., In re Marhoefer Packing Co., Inc., 674 F.2d 1139, 1144-1145 (7th Cir. 1982) (considering whether option price was \"nominal\" in comparison to the fair market value of leased assets at the time the option could be exercised \"as anticipated by the parties when the lease *", "* * [was] signed,\" for purposes of determining whether the lease should be recharacterized as a security interest); M & W Gear Co. v.

These cases lead petitioner to assert that \"the appropriate standard for analyzing a lessee's purchase option must focus on objective economic realities and whether those realities compel exercise or strongly favor exercise to a degree of certainty.\"", "We do not find that the cases petitioner cites establish a legal standard incompatible with this Court's analysis in John Hancock and require economic compulsion or circumstances that \"strongly favor exercise to a degree of certainty.\"", "In M & W Gear Co. v. Commissioner, 446 F.2d at 844-845 (discussing in detail evidence regarding the intent of the parties), the Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit considered not only the comparable sale prices for the leased assets, but the intent of the parties at the time of entering the transaction.", "In In re Marhoefer Packing Co., Inc., 674 F.2d at 1141, the same Court of Appeals discussed only the issue of whether a specific lease in question with a $1 purchase option qualified as a true lease or a security under the provisions of the Uniform Commercial Code.", "This discussion is not pertinent here because it does not pertain to any tax law issues.

This could potentially increase the value of the Spruce plant in both 2000 and 2032.", "However, we do not think this flaw necessarily fatal to the Spruce appraisal.", "If we calculate the present value of a stream of revenue equal to $100 per year at 10% discount rate and with a 40.85% tax rate over a period of 30 years and compare the results with the present value of the same revenue stream taxed at 35%, the difference will exceed $50.", "We note, however, because the tax rate affects the numerator in the present value calculation, slight fluctuations in the tax rate may not have a significant enough effect to require completely discarding an appraisal as unreliable.", "To compare, a 1% change in the discount rate, which affects the denominator, would also bring up by $50 the present value of the revenue stream above.", "Second, we find that Winston & Strawn attorneys interfered with the appraisal process' integrity and independence by providing Deloitte with the wording of the conclusions it expected to see in the final appraisal reports.", "Deloitte confirmed in its engagement letter that \"[t]he appraisal will be conducted in conformity with the * * *", "[USPAP] of the Appraisal Foundation and the Principles of Appraisal Practice and Code of Ethics of the American Society of Appraisers.\"", "USPAP ethics rules require an appraiser to \"perform assignments with impartiality, objectivity, and independence, and without accommodation of personal interests.\"", "Appraisal Foundation, Uniform Standards of Professional Appraisal Practice 2 (1999).

This further undermines the reliability of the appraisal reports Deloitte provided for all test transactions.", "Further, in analyzing the likelihood of cancellation option exercise by CPS, Deloitte failed to consider the costs of a potential subsidy CPS would have to pay to a qualified bidder or operator to entice such a bidder/operator to enter into an operating agreement or PTPA with petitioner if the energy industry does not fare as well as expected.", "Prof. Myers, however, considered such costs and concluded that in most cases CPS would still be better off taking the money and returning the Spruce station to petitioner.", "As to the likelihood of the cancellation option's exercise, it is unhelpful to petitioner's argument that Deloitte failed to consider the costs that CPS would have to incur to bring the Spruce plant to the required (per the Spruce sublease agreement) minimum operation standards for estimated annual capacity, net energy output, and efficiency.", "Meeting these requirements is a prerequisite for CPS to return the Spruce station to Exelon at the end of the sublease term.", "According to the Spruce sublease agreement, if CPS were to fail to deliver the Spruce station meeting the minimum operating and efficiency requirements, it would have to pay the diminution of fair market value or will be given another chance to exercise the cancellation option.", "Prof. Myers also failed to take these costs into consideration in his analysis.", "Thus, the price of failing to exercise the cancellation option for CPS would consist of (1) undertaking investments required to bring the Spruce station into compliance with the minimum operating standards and other return requirements; (2) securing a replacement property or source of electricity and related costs; and (3) potential subsidies to qualified bidders and transaction costs should Exelon decide to exercise the operating agreement or the service agreement options.", "To be more specific, CPS and petitioner agreed that if CPS decided to return the Spruce station at any time during the sublease or at the end of the sublease term in 2032, the Spruce station was required, at a minimum, to have an annual ratio of the actual net generation to the normal claimed capacity of at least 82% (capacity factor), operating for 8,760 hours per year.", "The Spruce station was also required to have the ratio of available generation to maximum generation of at least 89% and have an annual ratio of the heat energy output of not more than 10,950 Btu/kWh.", "Deloitte and Prof. Myers, however, used significantly lower capacity factors in their computations. These figures were based on Deloitte's due diligence of the Spruce station and the engineering reports provided by Stone & Webster.", "Both Deloitte and Prof. Myers assumed the plant capacity factor to be 90.3% in 2000, with gradual decline to 58.7% in 2032 (the end of the sublease term) and to 49.6% in 2052 (end of the Spruce headlease).", "These numbers, according to Prof. Myers, reflected the gradual obsolescence of the plant.", "Discounted cashflow analysis performed by Deloitte and Prof. Myers incorporated the plant capacity factor and the hours of operation to determine the cashflows from the Spruce plant and determine its value in 2032.", "This \"real Spruce plant\", however, was not what petitioner was entitled to receive at the end of the Spruce sublease period.", "Petitioner was entitled to receive, because CPS had agreed to deliver, a plant that would operate in 2032 at a plant capacity factor 23% greater than anticipated by petitioner's experts.", "This \"hypothetical Spruce plant\" would, therefore, generate a much higher revenue stream and would have a value significantly higher than the value projected by Deloitte and Prof. Myers.", "According to the Deloitte appraisal, the plant capacity factor for Spruce would go down to 72.2% by year 16 of the sublease, with the available hours of operation going down to 6,325.", "Deloitte estimated that the Spruce plant would operate at these levels up to year 30 of the sublease, and at year 31 of the sublease the Spruce plant capacity would be at 58.7%, with hours of operation at 5,139 per year.", "If the Spruce plant continued to operate throughout the term of the sublease at a minimum return requirements level (82% capacity factor and 8,760 operation hours per year), the cashflows in years 16-32 of the sublease would be at least 10% to 23% higher than anticipated by Deloitte.", "We also do not find reliable the Spruce plant value determined under the cost approach in the Deloitte appraisal.", "It is clear the appraisal considered the cost of purchasing an asset that would not meet the minimum operating requirements under the Spruce sublease agreement.", "Therefore, we conclude that the plant Exelon was entitled to receive at the end of the sublease term had characteristics distinctly different from those assumed by Deloitte and Prof. Myers.", "Although the parties did not submit any evidence regarding the amounts CPS would be required to invest in the Spruce station to meet the return standards, the requirement to do so significantly changes the economics of the Spruce transaction.", "We note that Prof. Myers stated in his analysis that \"a capacity factor 20% above [Deloitte] forecasts would move the return vs. cancel boundary up enough to include the base-case scenario [in Prof. Myers' analysis that petitioner would retain the plant].\"", "What Prof. Myers has not considered in his analysis, however, is how the parties allocated the risks and costs related to the diminution in the power plant efficiency.", "According to the Spruce transaction agreement documents, that risk was shifted to CPS. As we explained, if the Spruce plant failed to meet the minimum operating standards at the time it was returned to Exelon, CPS would have to either pay up the diminution in fair market value or exercise the cancellation option to cut its losses.", "Under the circumstances, we find it significantly more likely that CPS, should it attempt to walk away from the transaction and return the Spruce station to Exelon, would face substantial economic losses.", "Accordingly, we find that the range of scenarios under which CPS would decide to exercise its cancellation option is significantly broader than expected by petitioner's experts, including Prof. Myers.", "We also find that both petitioner and CPS, experienced power plant operators having the benefit of professional legal and other advice, understood that the terms of the Spruce transaction were inconsistent with the Deloitte appraisal and the projected future value of the Spruce station.", "The parties understood that it would be very difficult, if not impossible, for CPS to return the Spruce plant at the end of a 32-year sublease in almost the same condition in which CPS received it in 2000 without significant investment.", "Thus, the parties understood and reasonably expected at the time of entering into the Spruce transaction that CPS would exercise the cancellation option at the end of the sublease because meeting the return conditions would be extremely burdensome.", "According to Prof. Myers' analysis, with the required capacity factor of 82% in 2032, more than 20% higher than projected in the Spruce appraisal, it would be economically beneficial for CPS to exercise its cancellation option.", "Moreover, we note that when the City of San Antonio brought suit in court to obtain a declaratory judgment of the continued validity of certain covenants in its outstanding public securities--thereby allowing CPS to enter into the transaction with petitioner--in its initial draft of the petition the city represented that it intended to exercise the cancellation option.", "Even though this representation was subsequently deleted at the suggestion of Winston & Strawn and PwC, this Court infers an understanding among the parties that CPS would exercise the option to reacquire the Spruce plant.", "At the very least, it was reasonably likely at the time of the transaction that the purchase option would be exercised.", "We hold that the Spruce transaction fails the substance over form inquiry because petitioner did not acquire the benefits and burdens of ownership of the Spruce station.", "Petitioner's investment was not subject to more than a de minimis risk of loss. We need not consider the risks and benefits to petitioner of the remaining headlease period because it was reasonably likely that the circular flow of money allowing petitioner to fully recover its investment and interest would close on the last day of the Spruce sublease.", "We agree with respondent that the transaction most closely resembles a financial arrangement. Specifically, the Spruce transaction resembles a loan from Exelon to CPS.", "Exelon funded the Spruce transaction entirely with its own funds and received the funds back with interest in two tranches: the first tranche six months after the closing date and the second tranche at the end of the Spruce sublease term in the form of the cancellation option payment.", "Exelon's return on its investment was predetermined, and Exelon did not have an upside potential or much of downside risk with respect to the Spruce station.", "This is more indicative of a loan than of a genuine equity investment.", "Accordingly, we sustain respondent's disallowance of Exelon's depreciation deductions claimed on the 2001 tax return with respect to the Spruce transaction.", "Because the Scherer and Wansley transactions are structured and documented very similarly, we discuss them together.", "We use the same analysis framework as for the Spruce transaction.", "Petitioner and respondent make the same arguments for the Scherer and Wansley transactions as for the Spruce transaction.", "First, as we noted in discussing the Spruce transaction, a 100% out-of-pocket investment does not necessarily make a transaction nonabusive from a tax standpoint.", "Here, petitioner indeed used the untaxed proceeds from the sale of the Powerton station and did not use any loans to finance the Scherer and Wansley transactions (collectively, MEAG transactions).", "However, petitioner got 77.9% of its initial investment back just six months after the closing of the MEAG transactions in the form of prepaid rent from MEAG.", "A portion of the remaining 22.1% of the initial investment was placed into a trust account and invested in low-risk securities to provide for the payment of the MEAG purchase option at the end of the sublease period for MEAG transactions.", "Another portion was set aside to provide MEAG with the NPV benefit in consideration for entering into the transactions.", "For the same reasons we discussed for the Spruce transaction, we do not find that an out-of-pocket investment automatically shows that petitioner acquired benefits and burdens of ownership of Scherer and Wansley stations.", "This is especially important when six months into the transaction petitioner was in substantially the same cash position as with using loans to finance the leases.", "Second, similarly to the Spruce transaction, we do not see the rights and obligations conveyed by the Scherer and Wansley respective headlease and sublease agreements as significantly altering the rights of the parties.", "Petitioner did not have any obligations to MEAG with respect to the maintenance, operation, or insurance of the Scherer and Wansley stations during the sublease term or the remainder of the headlease.", "Petitioner also did not have to meet any return conditions in the case of headlease termination. The rights and obligations of the parties under the Scherer and Wansley subleases were essentially the same as in the Spruce transaction, with MEAG bearing all the costs and risks related to the interests in the stations it conveyed to petitioner in the MEAG transactions.", "As we observed in the discussion of the Spruce sublease, the terms of the sublease agreements were designed to insulate petitioner from any operational risks.", "Third, similar to the Spruce transaction, we do not find that petitioner's due diligence efforts are somehow indicative of a true ownership interest in the Scherer and Wansley stations.", "We also do not find any merit in petitioner's argument that it was exposed to a risk of MEAG's going bankrupt during the Scherer and Wansley sublease terms.", "Petitioner received an opinion from Holland & Knight that confirmed that the laws of the State of Georgia did not allow municipalities to declare bankruptcy.", "Petitioner's own expert, Dr. Gilson, confirmed in his expert report that Georgia would have to change its laws to allow MEAG to declare bankruptcy.", "We consider this scenario highly unlikely. See UnionBanCal Corp., 113 Fed. Cl. at 135 (discussing that highly unlikely risks do not add substance to a LILO transaction).", "In any event, credit enhancements put in place at the outset of the MEAG transactions provided petitioner with sufficient protection from that risk.", "We find that petitioner also did not face a substantial risk of loss with respect to the payment of the Scherer and Wansley rent by MEAG.", "The rent was prepaid six months into the sublease term, and the stipulated loss value provisions, together with MEAG and UII swaps, insulated petitioner from any significant risk of loss in this respect.", "We now turn to an analysis of whether it was reasonably likely that at the closing of the Scherer and Wansley transactions MEAG would exercise its purchase option.", "Similarly to the Spruce transaction, we will look not only at fair market value of the assets involved as of the option exercise date, but also to the costs to MEAG if it decides to forgo exercising the option.", "We will also briefly address the rights of the Scherer and Wansley coowners, who also received a right to exercise the purchase option if MEAG decided to forgo it.", "Neither petitioner nor respondent argues that there are legal, political, industrial, or technical reasons that would weigh in favor of or against MEAG's exercise of its purchase option.", "Thus, we consider financial and economic aspects of the MEAG transactions first.", "According to the Deloitte appraisal, the undivided interests petitioner received under the MEAG transactions were estimated to have fair market values of $203,800,000 for Wansley and $485,000,000 for Scherer using a discounted cash flow analysis, adjusted for inflation at 2.5% per annum, at the respective lease expiration dates.", "The Wansley purchase option price was set at $214 million, and the Scherer purchase option price was set at $537.1 million, with $143,543,915 and $179,284,424 allocable to the Wansley and Scherer test transactions, respectively.", "Because the Deloitte appraisals and expert reports addressed the Wansley transactions without allocating the values between Wansley 1 and 2, we will use the aggregate analysis and will assume that the projected value of the Wansley interest conveyed in the test transaction bears the same ratio to the overall projected value of the Wansley as the purchase option exercise value for the test transaction to the overall purchase option price.", "The cost approach inflation-adjusted values are $191,300,000 for the Wansley and $481,000,000 for the Scherer interest.", "For the same reasons we discussed supra note 26, we will be using the discounted cashflow results.", "The Deloitte appraisals for the Scherer and Wansley stations suffer from the same deficiencies we identified in our review of the Spruce appraisal.", "Deloitte elected to use the 40.85% corporate tax rate that included a 9% State corporate tax rate, even though MEAG does not pay income tax (and even if it did, Georgia taxes its corporations at a flat 6% rate).", "Winston & Strawn attorneys were very closely involved in the appraisal report preparation process. Deloitte did not consider the costs MEAG would have to incur if it decided not to exercise the purchase option, including the costs of bringing the plants up to the required operating standards.", "Deloitte also did not consider any additional factors that could make MEAG's cotenants consider exercising the purchase options, including obtaining majority control over the Scherer and Wansley stations.", "Petitioner's expert witnesses made the same arguments as for the Spruce transaction. Mr. Reed opined that it was impossible to predict with a degree of certainty whether MEAG or its cotenants would exercise the purchase options at the end of the Scherer and Wansley subleases.", "Ms. Hughes opined that the Deloitte appraisals conformed with the USPAP principles and the Deloitte analysis was reasonable and appropriate.", "Prof. Myers conducted the sensitivity analysis of the Deloitte appraisals and confirmed that if the inflation or electricity prices were higher than predicted by Deloitte, it would increase the likelihood of MEAG's exercising the purchase options.", "Prof. Myers concluded that MEAG would never purchase Wansley or Scherer in order to avoid the cost of a PTPA subsidy.", "Prof. Myers also recognized that changes in other factors, including capital investments, capacity factors, and discount rates will affect MEAG's decision.", "We also note that Prof. Myers used a different corporate tax rate (38.9%) for the Wansley and Scherer transactions.", "His discounted cashflow results, however, were comparable to those in the Deloitte appraisal reports because of several adjustments made by Prof. Myers, such as capital investments.", "Respondent's expert witness Dr. Skinner suggested that Deloitte should have used a 0% corporate tax rate to analyze the MEAG transactions and used a 6.3% discount rate based on cost of debt to MEAG.", "Dr. Skinner also suggested that Deloitte should have conducted sensitivity testing at least for corporate rates.", "With the new assumptions, Dr. Skinner concluded that MEAG would value the Scherer and Wansley stations a lot higher than the purchase option price and thus would be almost certain to exercise the purchase option.", "For similar reasons as those we discussed for the Spruce transaction, we agree that Deloitte should have used a 0% corporate tax rate and the prevailing discount rate in its analysis.", "As with the Spruce transaction, a further problem with the Scherer and Wansley appraisals is that Exelon was entitled to a operating efficiency of Scherer and Wansley at the end of the sublease significantly higher than the values used by Deloitte in the respective appraisals.", "If the Scherer and Wansley stations did not meet the minimum operating requirements outlined in the respective subleases, MEAG would have to pay damages reflecting the diminution in the value of the stations due to decreased efficiency.", "Deloitte and Prof. Myers failed to consider these costs in analyzing whether MEAG would exercise the purchase options at the end of the Scherer and Wansley subleases.", "For Wansley, petitioner was entitled to receive, because MEAG had agreed to deliver, the Wansley station at the end of the sublease with a capacity factor of at least 62% based on 8,760 hours of operation per year with the net energy output of at least 85%.", "The Wansley appraisal by Deloitte and Prof. Myers' report assumed a plant capacity factor of only 66.5% in 2000, declining to 39.2% in 2028 (Wansley sublease expiration year) and to 32.6% in 2045.", "These numbers were based on the engineering reports prepared by Stone & Webster.

Ambac Credit and petitioner would not have consented to the collateral replacement if they had anticipated they would have any problems with the payment at the end of the sublease term.", "In fact, one of the goals of replacing the collateral was to replace the Government securities, which did not give sufficient yield in the beginning of the 2000s, with relatively secure but higher yield instruments.", "Because MEAG could not declare bankruptcy under the laws of Georgia, we find that petitioner did not bear any significant risk of nonpayment at the end of the sublease periods for the Scherer and Wansley stations.", "One of the significant differences between the MEAG transactions and the Spruce transaction is that MEAG's cotenants in the Wansley and Scherer stations received the right to exercise the purchase option at the end of the subleases should MEAG fail to do so.", "Petitioner and respondent did not put much emphasis on that right in their briefs. Prof. Myers, petitioner's expert, concluded that cotenants would use the same analysis as MEAG to decide whether to exercise the purchase options.", "We agree with this statement, but we also emphasize that the cotenants may have some other significant considerations that may make it more likely that they will step in and purchase the interests in the Scherer and Wansley stations if MEAG fails to do so.", "This further insulates petitioner from the risk of loss in the MEAG transactions or a risk of MEAG's nonpayment.", "We hold that the Wansley and Scherer transactions fail the substance-over-form inquiry because petitioner did not acquire the benefits and burdens of ownership of the Scherer and Wansley stations.", "It was reasonably likely at the time the MEAG transactions were entered into that MEAG or its cotenants would exercise the purchase options at the end of the sublease term.", "Accordingly, we do not need to consider the risks and benefits to petitioner of the remaining headlease periods.", "We agree with respondent that the MEAG transactions most closely resemble financial arrangements. Specifically, the MEAG transactions resemble loans from Exelon to MEAG because Exelon's income was predetermined and the transaction did not have an upside potential or significant downside risks for Exelon.", "Because Exelon funded the transactions with its own funds and there are two distinct tranches of money it expected to receive back, it is appropriate to characterize each transaction as creating two loan instruments: one to be repaid six months after the closing date in the form of prepaid rent, and the second to be repaid at the time of the purchase option payment.", "Accordingly, we sustain respondent's disallowance of Exelon's depreciation deductions claimed on the 2001 tax return with respect to the Spruce transaction.", "Respondent further asserts that we should disallow petitioner's depreciation, interest, and transaction cost deductions claimed on the 2001 tax return because the test transactions lacked economic substance.", "Respondent did not directly challenge the 1999 like-kind exchange gain deferral under the economic substance doctrine.", "Because we resolve the issues related to the disputed deductions claimed in petitioner's 2001 tax return on substance over form grounds, we need not address this alternative theory.", "IV. Consequences for the 1999 Tax Year Section 1031 Like-Kind Exchange Adjustment", "Section 1031(a)(1) provides: \"No gain or loss shall be recognized on the exchange of property held for productive use in a trade or business or for investment if such property is exchanged solely for property of like kind which is to be held either for productive use in a trade or business or for investment.\"", "The regulations further explain that \"the words 'like kind' have reference to the nature or character of the property and not to its grade or quality.", "One kind or class of property may not, under * * * section [1031], be exchanged for property of a different kind or class.\"", "We have held that all of the test transactions failed the substance over form inquiry because petitioner did not acquire the benefits and burdens of ownership in the assets involved in the test transactions.", "We have also concluded that the test transactions are more similar to loans made by petitioner to CPS and MEAG because petitioner's return on its investment was predetermined at the time petitioner entered into the test transactions.", "Accordingly, in 1999 petitioner exchanged the Powerton and Collins power plants for an interest in financial instruments.", "Such an exchange fails to meet the \"like kind\" requirement outlined in the Code and the regulations. Thus, petitioner must recognize the gain it received in 1999 on the sale of the Powerton and Collins plants under section 1001.", "V. 2001 Interest Expense Deductions and Rental Income", "Six months after the closing of the test transactions, petitioner received prepayment of all rent from CPS and MEAG due under the respective sublease agreements.", "Petitioner reported the rent payments as income according to the provisions of section 467.", "Section 467 governs the reporting of rental income from rental agreements that are treated as leases for Federal income tax purposes and which either have increasing or decreasing rents, or prepaid or deferred rents.", "See sec. 467(d)(1) ; Sec. 1.467-1(c), (h)(12), Income Tax Regs. If a rental agreement constitutes a section 467 rental agreement, the lessor and the lessee must take into account only the sum of the section 467 rent and interest during the taxable year.", "We have concluded that petitioner did not acquire the benefits and burdens of ownership in the Spruce, Wansley, or Scherer plant.", "We have also concluded that the test transactions most closely resemble financial arrangements in the form of loans from petitioner to CPS and MEAG.", "Thus, the agreements among petitioner, CPS, and MEAG are not lease agreements for Federal tax purposes under section 467, and petitioner may not deduct interest or include rental income with respect to them for the taxable year 2001.", "This is consistent with our conclusion that petitioner failed to enter into a like-kind exchange in 1999 and must recognize the gain on the sale of the Powerton and Collins stations.", "VI. Original Issue Discount and Transaction Expenses", "A taxpayer receives OID income when a debt instrument is issued for less than its face value. See Sec. 1273;", "United States v. Midland-Ross Corp., 381 U.S. 54, 85 (1965); and John Hancock Life Ins. Co. (U.S.A.) v.

Commissioner, 141 T.C. at 147 (citing section 1272(a)(1)).", "Respondent argues that petitioner has OID income arising out of petitioner's equity contribution that would be repaid through the cancellation/purchase options with interest.", "Respondent suggests that such contributions should be treated in the same manner as a zero-coupon bond.", "Respondent further contends that the terms of each test transaction established a guaranteed, fixed return to Exelon through the use of defeasance instruments.", "Respondent maintains that we should follow the same approach as in John Hancock, where this Court upheld the Commissioner's recharacterization of a number of SILO transactions as in substance a loan from the taxpayer to the counterparties and applied the OID rules.", "Petitioner's main argument is that the test transactions should be characterized as leases, not loans, and thus petitioner does not have any OID income.", "For the reasons set forth in the previous portions of the opinion, this argument lacks merit. Because petitioner, CPS, and MEAG reasonably expected that the respective cancellation/purchase options would be exercised at the end of the sublease period, the purchase option price was fixed, and the funds for payments set aside (defeased) as of the closing date, the transactions represent fixed obligations similar to those discussed in John Hancock.", "Accordingly, we uphold respondent's application of the OID rules and his calculation of OID income thereunder.", "In addition, we note that because each transaction was fully funded by petitioner's money and created two distinctive tranches of money--one payable in six months, one at the end of the respective sublease term--each tranche should be treated as a separate debt instrument under the OID rules.", "Ordinary and necessary business expenses paid or incurred in carrying on any trade or business are generally deductible.", "See sec. 162(a). We have concluded as to all test transactions that they are properly characterized as loans from petitioner to CPS and MEAG.", "We also concluded that for each transaction, the loan consisted of two tranches, one due six months after the closing date, the other due at the time of the cancellation/purchase price option payment.", "Under section 1.1273-2(g)(4), Income Tax Regs., transaction costs must be included as an additional amount lent to the borrowers.", "See also John Hancock Life Ins. Co. (U.S.A.) v. Commissioner, 141 T.C. at 149. Thus, petitioner's transaction costs related to the test transactions are not deductible and should be allocated to the respective loans.", "The parties are further directed to address the issue of transaction cost allocation in Rule 155 computations.", "We recognize that there may be several ways to approach this issue. One way would be to allocate transaction costs pro rata to the amounts of the respective loans.", "The other way would be to allocate expenses on the basis of the billing records and invoices of petitioner's advisers related to the transactions at issue.", "Section 6662(a) and (b)(1) and (2) imposes a 20% accuracy-related penalty on the portion of an underpayment of tax attributable to negligence or disregard of rules and regulations or a substantial understatement of income tax.", "The accuracy-related penalty does not apply to any portion of an underpayment for which a taxpayer had reasonable cause and acted in good faith.", "This Court previously held that the statutory provisions shifting the burden of production to the Commissioner with respect to penalties are inapplicable to corporations.", "See NT, Inc. v. Commissioner, 126 T.C. 191, 195 (2006) (holding that section 7491(c) does not apply to a C corporation's liability for a penalty, an addition to tax, or an additional amount).", "Petitioner in the consolidated cases before us is a corporation. Thus, the provisions of section 7491(c) do not apply.", "Respondent determined accuracy-related penalties pursuant to section 6662(a) of $86,234,918 for the 1999 tax year and $1,106,922 for the 2001 tax year in the respective notices of deficiency.", "Respondent determined these penalties on the grounds of negligence and disregard of rules and regulations and substantial understatements of income tax.", "Respondent has conceded the substantial understatement of income tax grounds for the 2001 tax year.", "Petitioner argues that no penalty is appropriate in these cases because petitioner was not negligent, did not disregard any applicable rules and regulations, and acted reasonably and in good faith when relying on the tax advice of its advisers, who adequately considered all relevant law under the applicable standards at the time of the transactions.", "In addition, petitioner asserts that the OID income cannot be included in the penalty computations because this argument has only recently been introduced and developed by the Commissioner and the courts, and petitioner could not anticipate such an assertion in 1999 and 2000, at the time of closing the transactions.", "B. Negligence or Disregard of Rules and Regulations", "We will address the issue of negligence or disregard of rules and regulations first because it was determined as the ground for penalties in both notices of deficiency on which these cases are based.", "Section 6662(a) and (b)(1) imposes a 20% penalty on any portion of an underpayment of tax attributable to negligence or disregard of rules or regulations.", "Negligence includes \"any failure to make a reasonable attempt to comply with the provisions of the internal revenue laws or to exercise ordinary and reasonable care in the preparation of a tax return.\"", "Sec. 1.6662-3(b)(1), Income Tax Regs.

Id.", "However, the penalty does not apply to any portion of an underpayment for which a taxpayer had reasonable cause and acted in good faith.", "See sec. 6664(c)(1). This defense can be established through reasonable and good-faith reliance on advice received from a competent tax professional.", "See United States v.

Further, because Winston & Strawn directed the conclusions that Deloitte had to arrive at, we are highly suspicious that the tax opinions are similarly tainted.", "We also concluded that the technical and engineering assumptions used in the Deloitte appraisals were inconsistent with the return conditions specified in the test transaction documents, which made the exercise of the purchase/cancellation options considerably more likely.", "Winston & Strawn, as the firm that drafted the transaction documents and was closely involved in all stages of the test transactions, knew or should have known of this defect and that its tax opinions were therefore based on unreasonable assumptions and arrived at unreasonable conclusions in the light of how the transactions were actually structured.", "The third prong of the Neonatology test requires the taxpayer to show that it relied in good faith on the adviser's judgment.", "There is a longstanding policy of not requiring taxpayers to second-guess the work of a tax professional providing the advice.", "As the Supreme Court has stated, \"[t]o require the taxpayer to challenge the attorney, to seek a 'second opinion,' or to try to monitor counsel on the provisions of the Code himself would nullify the very purpose of seeking the advice of a presumed expert in the first place.\"", "Boyle, 469 U.S. at 251; see also Bruce v.

The deferred tax would be financially similar to a 0% borrowing note.", "By reinvesting it, Unicom could receive a significant yield premium. Moreover, leveraging the new lease in such a manner would leave Unicom in substantially the same cash position.", "The PwC strategy envisioned a lease term in the range of 20-25 years with an \"enhancement and defeasance structure providing for AA rated or better enhancement of the lessee's entire financial obligations to Unicom.\"", "PwC compared the costs for maintaining the new lease investment with maintaining a typical debt private placement.", "Under the strategy, Unicom would lease the exchange assets to the lessee under a triple net lease with an end-of-term fixed purchase option.", "Unicom would pass on a portion of its tax deferral benefit to the lessees through a reduction in rental obligation.", "The lessee would \"defease its rental obligations, and thereby monetize the lower rental cost into an upfront cash benefit.\"", "The final structure of the like-kind exchange and sale-leaseback was different, as explained further in this Opinion.", "PwC pointed out to petitioner that municipal utilities and rural electric cooperatives seeking to monetize tax benefits they could not use because of their tax-exempt status would be interested in entering into a sale-leaseback transaction.", "PwC also suggested that taxable entities desiring to obtain low cost/off-balance-sheet financing alternatives might also be interested.", "After the initial consultation with PwC, Mr. Roling decided to present the idea of the like-kind exchange to his superiors.", "IV. Unicom's Decision To Enter Into the Test Transactions", "Mr. Roling first presented the PwC strategy to Mr. Berdelle. Although Mr. Berdelle initially did not fully understand the strategy, he decided it had promise and was in line with Unicom's tax strategy.", "John C. Bukovski, the chief financial officer of Unicom, gave Mr. Roling permission to move forward with the like-kind exchange strategy and present it to the Unicom's board of directors for consideration and approval.", "On October 5, 1999, two months after receiving ICC approval to sell ComEd's fossil fuel power plants, ComEd submitted a notice to the ICC stating that it was considering entering into a like-kind exchange for at least several of the fossil fuel power plants.", "On October 14, 1999, Unicom and PwC executed an agreement whereby Unicom retained PwC to act as its financial adviser in connection with the proposed like-kind exchange strategy.", "On October 20, 1999, Mr. Berdelle provided information on the strategy to Unicom's board of directors.", "He presented the strategy during the board meeting held on October 27, 1999, seeking and receiving approval for various preliminary steps necessary to pursue the concept and preserve the option of entering into a like-kind exchange transaction.", "Mr. Berdelle assembled a team to further evaluate the like-kind exchange opportunity. That team consisted of a number of Unicom's employees from various departments, including the tax department, treasury and finance departments, engineers, and outside consultants.", "Core members of the team, including Mr. Berdelle, Robert Hanley, a tax department employee, and Mr. Roling, would meet weekly, if not more often, to discuss the status of the project.", "Neither Mr. Roling nor anyone on his staff in the tax department had any experience with like-kind exchanges.", "Because Unicom did not have the internal expertise necessary to adequately assess all of the legal and technical aspects of the proposed like-kind exchange, Unicom employed a number of consultants and advisers to work on the project, including performing due diligence of potential replacement properties.", "Unicom retained a Chicago law firm, Winston & Strawn LLP (Winston & Strawn) to advise on the legal aspects of the transaction, including its tax consequences.", "In addition, in March or April of 2000 Unicom engaged Stone & Webster Management Consultants, Inc. (Stone & Webster), to provide engineering and environmental reports on prospective replacement properties.", "Unicom retained Deloitte to conduct an appraisal of the relinquished properties and potential replacement properties in November 1999.", "In addition, petitioner engaged PwC (financial and accounting adviser), Arthur Andersen (accounting adviser), Sidley Austin (regulatory counsel), Vinson & Elkins (Texas counsel), and Holland & Knight (Georgia counsel).", "V. Identification of Properties To be Relinquished in the Like-Kind Exchange", "On or about December 9, 1999, six days before the closing of the sale under the EME agreement, Unicom identified the Collins and Powerton stations as the properties it would try to exchange for like-kind replacement properties.", "Mr. Roling concluded, on the basis of the valuations from Deloitte, that the fair market value of the Collins station at that time was $930 million, with an expected taxable gain of $823 million, while the fair market value of Powerton station was $870 million, with an expected taxable gain of $683 million.", "Unicom did not plan to execute a like-kind exchange for any of the other fossil fuel power plants it was selling.", "VI. Identification of Like-Kind Replacement Properties and Due Diligence", "Because section 1031 has a strict timeframe for identification--on or before the 45th day after the date on which the relinquished property is transferred--and acquisition of replacement property--within 180 days of the date on which the relinquished property is transferred (or, if earlier, the transferor's tax return due date for the year in which the transfer of the relinquished property occurs)--Unicom started looking for potential replacement properties before the closing of the sale under the EME agreement.", "By November 1999 PwC had identified 26 prospective lessees. Unicom did not participate in the initial identification process.", "On or about November 9-10, 1999, PwC, on behalf of Unicom, sent proposals to a number of potential lessees for the sale-leaseback portion of the like-kind exchange.", "PwC contacted both taxable and tax-exempt entities.

For example, Stone & Webster identified stress corrosion cracking in the low pressure turbine sections of the Wansley station.", "Stone & Webster also raised concerns about the potential for the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency to take action relating to maintenance activities at Wansley.", "At the Scherer station, Stone & Webster identified spills associated with transformer failures and fires.", "Unicom chose not to follow up on any of these and other findings.", "In addition, two ComEd engineers visited all of the stations before June 2000. Their review, however, was not as thorough as Stone & Webster's and involved only short site visits and interviews.", "ComEd engineers did not find any problems with any of the stations.", "Deloitte prepared appraisal reports for all three replacement properties as well as for the fossil fuel power plants sold by Unicom under the EME agreement.", "The reports provided current valuations of the replacement properties, as well as valuation opinions as to the plants' residual values and remaining useful lives, and the likelihood of the prospective lessees' being economically compelled to exercise their cancellation or purchase options.", "In preparing the reports, Deloitte sought to address specific requirements set forth in Internal Revenue Service (IRS) published guidance on leasing transactions, such as the requirements articulated in Rev.

opinions, but the board memorandum dated March 28, 2000, discussed some tax and legal risks.", "Specifically, appendix D discussed the risks related to the MEAG transaction, and appendix E discussed the risks related to the CPS transaction.", "On the risks related to a MEAG bankruptcy, the conclusion was that the risk was mitigated by MEAG's inability to become a debtor under current Georgia

option.", "However, this statement was later deleted at the suggestion of Winston & Strawn and PwC, who reviewed the petition on behalf of Unicom and provided comments.", "The City of San Antonio represented in its petition that it retained fee ownership in the Spruce station and retained possession and rights to operate it during the leaseback term.", "The City of San Antonio also represented that all the rent would be prepaid six months after the closing date on the leaseback transaction and that the City of San Antonio would make an investment that upon maturity would provide the amounts necessary to pay for the cancellation option.", "The City estimated that the net present value of the rights which Unicom would acquire in the future was approximately $40 million.", "On June 2, 2000,

sublease by CPS, the second fund would be set aside for investment that would secure the payment of the cancellation option should CPS decide not to reacquire the Spruce station at the end of the sublease, and the third fund would be retained by CPS and could be used for its current needs.", "Pursuant to the headlease agreement for the Spruce transaction (Spruce headlease), CPS leased the

the station beyond repair, CPS could elect to either replace the Spruce station or terminate the Spruce sublease.", "In any of these scenarios, Unicom had a number of remedies against CPS, including collecting the stipulated loss value of the Spruce sublease, and taking possession of the Spruce station to operate, sell, or sublease it to somebody else.", "The stipulated loss value was predetermined on the closing date and based on the Deloitte Spruce appraisal and was meant to ensure Unicom's return on the investment.", "Under the Spruce headlease, Unicom had the right to use, operate, and possess the Spruce station without interference from CPS.", "Unicom did not have any obligations to CPS in respect of maintenance, operation, or insurance of the Spruce station under the headlease.", "Upon the Spruce headlease expiration, Unicom could return the Spruce station to CPS. Unicom was not obligated to make any representations or warranties with respect to the Spruce station except that it was free and clear of liens in case CPS decided to exercise its cancellation option at the end of the Spruce sublease term.", "The Spruce sublease was a triple-net lease, meaning that CPS was responsible for all the costs and expenses, foreseen or unforeseen, in connection with the Spruce station, including costs of operation, maintenance, insurance, improvements and other expenses.", "The Spruce sublease contained a covenant of quiet enjoyment in favor of CPS unless it defaulted under the sublease.", "CPS could, at its own expense, use, operate, service, repair, and maintain the property as long as it complied with the industry standards and applicable laws and did not have a material adverse effect on the Spruce station, did not result in risk of criminal liability, and did not involve any material risk of loss, forfeiture, or sale of the Spruce station.", "CPS was solely responsible for environmental compliance and any necessary remedial measures.

He was also a director for Entergy Corp., a large public utility and merchant power generator based in New Orleans, Louisiana, that also has generating plants in the eastern and northeastern United States.", "In his expert report Prof. Myers discussed the primary factors that affect the decisions of the parties involved in the test transactions to exercise their respective options.", "Prof. Myers testified that, while both MEAG and CPS do not pay income tax, their tax-exempt status does not affect their valuation of the leased stations.", "Prof. Myers also testified that the accepted financial practice always makes decisions based on after-tax cashflows and rates of return.", "Prof. Myers conducted sensitivity analysis involving several variables such as inflation and electricity price to determine the range of future market values of residual interests in the Spruce, Scherer, and Wansley stations and to see how it would affect the decisions of CPS and MEAG to exercise their cancellation/purchase options at the end of the sublease terms.", "He concluded that both CPS and MEAG would return their respective interests in the subleased stations to Exelon if the values of these interests at the end of the sublease terms were less than the purchase option prices.", "This would also cover the \"base\" scenario outlined in the Deloitte appraisal.", "We find Prof. Myers' sensitivity analysis helpful because it illustrates that even a difference of 1%-2% in the inflation rate would dramatically change the future market value of an interest over a 30-year term.", "For example, in the case of the Spruce station, a 4% inflation rate--1.5% higher than the rate assumed by Deloitte--would result in the future market value of the plant of $971.1 million, almost $250 million above the exercise price of $723.2 million for the cancellation option and almost $350 above the fair market value projected by the Deloitte appraisal.", "Conversely, a 1% inflation rate--1.5% lower than the rate assumed by Deloitte--would result in the future market value of the plant of $394.2 million, almost $330 million less than the cancellation option exercise price and over $200 million less than the fair market value projected by the Deloitte appraisal.", "The Court recognized John J.

According to Dr. Skinner, here, where both CPS and MEAG are tax-exempt entities, their cashflows are about 40% higher than the cashflows Deloitte assumes, significantly increasing the value of the assets at the sublease termination dates.", "Second, Dr. Skinner concluded that Deloitte also applied too high a discount rate to these cashflows, further reducing the estimated value of the assets.", "Dr. Skinner recalculated the value of each asset using Deloitte's cashflows and applying a 0% tax rate and lower discount rates of 6.1% for Spruce and 6.3% for Wansley and Scherer.", "His calculations show an estimated value for each asset at the sublease expiration date that is substantially higher than the cancellation/purchase option exercise price.", "Thus, Dr. Skinner concluded that it was nearly certain that CPS and MEAG will exercise their respective cancellation/purchase options at the end of the sublease terms, allowing Exelon to obtain the option proceeds without ever bearing any significant risk of loss.", "In addition Dr. Skinner opined that CPS and MEAG would be economically compelled to exercise their cancellation/purchase options because of the \"onerous\" conditions they would face if they did not exercise their respective options.", "Dr. Skinner in his expert report shows that, absent tax benefits available under section 1031, Exelon would never recover its initial investment in the lease.", "Thus, Dr. Skinner concluded that Exelon would be able to generate a positive return from the transactions only because of the tax benefits.", "The Court recognized Christopher Knittel as an expert in energy and environmental economics, industrial organization, and regulation.", "Dr. Knittel is the William Barton Rogers professor of energy economics in the Sloan School of Management at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.", "He has a Ph.D. in economics from the University of California at Berkeley.

Mr. Saraon is a former director of Citigroup with a graduate degree in management from the MIT Sloan School of Management.", "Mr. Saraon opined that the structure of the test transactions, including the credit enhancement provisions, was very different from traditional U.S. leveraged leases.", "The Court, with prior agreement of the parties, directed certain expert witnesses, including Prof. Myers, Dr. Skinner, and Mr. Reed, to testify concurrently.", "The procedure was implemented in substantially the same way as in Rovakat, LLC v.

Thus, because petitioner exchanged ownership interests in power plants for financial instruments (low-risk loans), petitioner failed to meet section 1031 like-kind exchange requirements.", "Further, respondent argues that because the substance of each test transaction is a loan rather than a lease, these loans should generate original issue discount (OID) income under section 1272.", "According to respondent, petitioner is not entitled to depreciation deductions under section 168, interest deductions under section 467, or transaction cost deductions under section 162.", "In the alternative, respondent argues that the test transactions lack economic substance because they were driven by tax considerations and the desire to defer taxation of a $1.6 billion gain, not by a legitimate business purpose.", "Accordingly, respondent urges the Court to disregard the test transactions altogether and conclude that petitioner failed to enter into a like-kind exchange.", "Respondent maintains that petitioner never expected to realize pretax benefits from the test transactions alone.", "However, together with the tax deferral benefits available under section 1031, petitioner would be able to more than make up for the economic losses associated with the test transactions.", "Further, respondent argues that petitioner is also liable for accuracy-related penalties under section 6662 for both tax years, 1999 and 2001, for negligently engaging in transactions that it should have known were \"too good to be true\".", "According to respondent, petitioner's tax reporting also resulted in a substantial understatement of income tax for the 1999 tax year.", "We have discussed in detail the seminal cases and regulations related to leveraged leases, LILOs, and SILOs in this Court's opinion in John Hancock Life Ins.

Lessee had an option to purchase the building at certain times during the lease and at the end of the 25-year lease term.", "Lessee also had an option to renew the lease for additional periods of time. Frank Lyon claimed depreciation deductions and interest expense deductions related to the building.", "After considering the transaction, the Supreme Court held that the form of a sale-leaseback transaction will be respected for Federal tax purposes as long as the lessor retains significant and genuine attributes of a traditional lessor.", "Id. at 584. The Supreme Court recognized that these attributes necessarily depend on the facts of a particular case.", "Id. According to the Supreme Court, several factors weighed in favor of the taxpayer in Frank Lyon. Frank Lyon bore the financial risks of the transaction by assuming responsibility for loan repayment and investing its own money in the transaction.", "Id. at 581. The Supreme Court concluded that there was a real possibility that the lessor could walk away from the transaction at the end of the initial lease.", "The parties negotiated the deal in good faith and were independent of each other. The parties paid the same tax rates, making the transaction tax neutral.", "The rent and purchase option prices were reasonable, and Frank Lyon assumed the credit risk of the lessee's defaulting on its rent payments.", "Around the time the Supreme Court issued its ruling in Frank Lyon, the Government was working on developing a set of rules to determine whether a leveraged lease transaction is a true lease or something else.", "In 1975 the Commissioner issued guidelines for advance ruling purposes on whether a leveraged lease will be respected for Federal tax purposes as a lease.", "Rev.

L. No. 98-369, sec. 31, 98 Stat. at 509.", "The unintended consequence of the Pickle rule was the proliferation of LILO transactions with tax-exempt entities.", "LILO transactions were designed to work around the Pickle rule because the taxable party leased the property from the tax-exempt counterparty instead of buying it, and then immediately subleased it back to the tax-exempt entity.", "To fund the transaction, the taxable party typically took out a nonrecourse loan covering 80%-90% of the initial lease.", "See John Hancock Life Ins. Co. (U.S.A.) v. Commissioner, 141 T.C. at 11.", "The sublease to a tax-exempt entity would typically be shorter than the initial lease term. At the end of the sublease, the tax-exempt entity usually has the option to purchase the remainder of the leasehold interest in the initial lease.", "Even if the tax-exempt entity decides not to exercise its purchase option, the taxable party could still compel the tax-exempt entity to renew the sublease, take possession of the asset, or procure the replacement sublease.", "To return the asset to the taxable party, the tax-exempt entity would typically need to meet certain conditions, including refinancing the nonrecourse loan involved in the transactions.", "Failure to meet the return conditions meant that the tax-exempt entity had to exercise the purchase option.", "In 1999 LILO transactions became less popular because of a change in the regulations under section 467, which required that prepayment of the initial lease rent be treated as a loan for tax purposes.", "Id. at 16; see also sec. 1.467-4, Income Tax Regs. After that, investors started using SILOs to obtain similar results.", "See John Hancock Life Ins. Co. (U.S.A.) v.

The inquiry into the likelihood of purchase option exercise is determinative because if the original property holder is reasonably expected to exercise the purchase option at the end of the sublease, the obligations of the parties under SILO/LILO would offset each other, so that a taxpayer would be insulated from any economic risk of loss and would not be able to take advantage of any potential gain.", "Id. at 94. Instead, a taxpayer would be guaranteed a fixed return on its investment at the end of a sublease term.", "This would indicate that the taxpayer did not obtain any benefits or burdens associated with the leasehold or ownership interest transferred in a SILO/LILO.", "For the LILO transactions in John Hancock, the Court concluded that \"any legal, political, industrial, or technical objections to the nonexercise of the purchase options can be overcome, and thus are not determinative of whether [the LILO counterparty] is reasonably likely to exercise its purchase option.\"", "John Hancock Life Ins. Co. (U.S.A.) v. Commissioner, 141 T.C. at 99, 107. Thus, the Court based its ultimate conclusion primarily on financial analysis, including a comparison of the costs of the purchase option and alternative end-of-sublease options.", "In all LILO test transactions, the Court concluded that it was reasonably likely that the LILO counterparties would exercise their respective purchase options.", "Id. at 109-110. The Court came to the same conclusion for one of the SILO transactions, the SNCB SILO.", "Id. at 145. Thus, the Court held that the substance of all the LILO and SNCB SILO transactions was inconsistent with their form and that these transactions resembled loans because John Hancock did not acquire genuine attributes of ownership or leasehold interest.", "Id. at 109-110, 145. As a result, the Court held that John Hancock was not entitled to rental expense and depreciation deductions related to these transactions.", "Id. at 109-110, 145. The Court also disallowed the interest expense for the nonrecourse loans John Hancock took out to finance the transactions.", "Id. at 146-147. Further, the Court recharacterized the equity contributions into these transactions as a loan giving rise to the original issue discount (OID) income.", "Id. at 148.

According to the appraisals, the projected fair market value of the assets involved in the remaining SILOs was going to be substantially lower than the purchase option exercise price.", "Id. at 114-115, 123-124. Thus, the Court assumed that these options would not be exercised and proceeded with the analysis of whether John Hancock had any economic risk after the end of the sublease and until the end of the lease.", "The Court then concluded that John Hancock indeed faced economic risks indicative of ownership during that period under the service contract option because any payments under that option were not guaranteed.", "Id. at 132-135. Thus, the Commissioner did not succeed with the substance-over-form argument for these remaining transactions.", "With respect to the remaining SILO transactions, the Court held that John Hancock acquired a future interest in the transferred assets and was thus not entitled to depreciation deductions before the purchase option exercise date.", "John Hancock Ins. Co. (U.S.A.) v. Commissioner, 141 T.C. at 137. Because John Hancock had only future interest in the assets, the Court disallowed any interest deductions as well.", "Id. at 147.

Unlike parties in traditional LILO/SILO transactions, petitioner did not use any loans to pay the Spruce headlease rent.", "Instead, it paid with the proceeds of a recent sale of its own power plant. CPS returned only 76.9% of the headlease rent to prepay the rent during the Spruce sublease term.", "Petitioner argues that the 23.1% CPS retained after prepayment of the Spruce sublease rent satisfies any equity tests derived from judicial decisions and administrative guidance.", "Second, petitioner maintains that the rights and obligations conveyed by the Spruce headlease and sublease agreements are typical of traditional leases and significantly alter the rights of the parties.", "Specifically, petitioner cites the necessity for CPS to obtain consent for improvements that could have a material impact on the value of the subleased property.", "Third, petitioner points to its extensive due diligence efforts as indicative of obtaining a true ownership interest in the Spruce station.", "Finally, petitioner claims that it was exposed to a significant risk of loss in case of CPS' bankruptcy and sublease rejection because of the limitations of section 502(b)(6) of the Bankruptcy Code.", "We begin with an observation that what made SILO and LILO transactions abusive was not only the amount of equity invested by the parties entering into such transactions but rather the circular flow of money such transactions created.", "As the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit explained in Wells Fargo, 641 F.3d at 1330:", "[W]e are left with purely circular transactions that elevate form over substance. The only flow of funds between the parties to the transaction was the initial lump sum given to the tax-exempt entity as compensation for its participation in the transaction.", "From the tax-exempt entity's point of view, the transaction effectively ended as soon as it began. The benefits to Wells Fargo continued to flow throughout the term of the sublease, however, in the form of deferred tax payments.", "The third-party lender and its affiliate were also compensated for their participation, as were the creators and promoters of the transactions.", "These transactions were win-win situations for all of the parties involved because free money--in the form of previously unavailable tax benefits utilized by Wells Fargo--was divided among all parties.", "The money was not entirely \"free,\" of course, because it was in effect transferred to Wells Fargo from the public fisc.", "Here, the funds necessary to fund the headlease rent came from the untaxed proceeds of the Collins power plant sale by petitioner.", "In addition to attempting to reap the benefits of long-term tax deferral under the section 1031 rules for like- kind exchanges, petitioner claimed various tax deductions associated with its participation in the Spruce, Scherer, and Wansley transactions.", "Unlike the taxpayer in Frank Lyon, which entered into a sale-leaseback with another taxable entity such that the transaction was tax neutral as a result, petitioner entered into a transaction with a tax-exempt entity.", "This would allow petitioner to double-dip into the tax benefits by deferring the tax under section 1031 and using deductions related to the test transactions.", "The structure of the cashflows in the Spruce transaction guaranteed the return of 76.9% of petitioner's initial investment just six months after the closing date in the form of rent prepayment under the Spruce sublease.", "During that period, CPS obtained credit enhancements to secure the payment of the rent. The rest of petitioner's investment was either used to pay the accommodation fee to CPS in the form of the NPV benefit or set aside pursuant to the Spruce CPUA to secure the payments of the stipulated loss value during the period of the Spruce sublease or the payment of the purchase option price at the end of the sublease.", "CPS obtained credit enhancement and insurance for the CPUA from AIG, and the interest rate risk was also insured.", "Thus, similarly to traditional SILOs or LILOs, the Spruce transaction created a circular flow of money accompanied by a transfer of tax benefits from a tax-exempt to a taxable entity.", "See Wells Fargo, 641 F.3d at 1330. In addition, the terms of the Spruce transaction ensured that only six months into the deal petitioner would be in the same cash position as if it had taken out a loan to finance the transaction, similar to traditional SILOs and LILOs.", "In effect, CPS did not have any control over petitioner's investment after the closing of the transaction with the exception of the NPV benefit, which was CPS' reward for entering into the Spruce transaction.", "Accordingly, we are not persuaded by petitioner's argument that a 100% upfront out-of-pocket investment precludes the finding that any of the test transactions were abusive.", "We also disagree with petitioner's argument that the Spruce headlease or sublease somehow significantly altered the parties' rights and obligations with respect to the Spruce station.", "Under the Spruce headlease, petitioner did not have any obligations to CPS in respect of the maintenance, operation, or insurance of the Spruce station during the sublease term or the remainder of the headlease.", "If petitioner were to return the Spruce station to CPS at the end of the headlease or if the headlease was terminated, it was not required to meet any return conditions except making sure the Spruce station was free from petitioner's liens.", "Under the terms of the Spruce sublease, CPS accepted all the risks related to the operation of the Spruce station throughout the sublease term.", "CPS also agreed to observe certain maintenance and operating standards, subleasing restrictions, assignment rights, restrictions and requirements pertaining to alterations and modifications, environmental compliance, and minimum insurance coverage.", "These restrictions were designed to insulate petitioner's risk during the sublease term and ensure that in the worst case scenario--if CPS does not exercise its cancellation option at the end of the sublease--the Spruce station would be in good working condition.", "In short, CPS merely agreed to operate the station during the sublease term in the same manner a reasonable owner would.", "Similar to John Hancock, there is no evidence that before the closing date CPS was not already adhering to the same operating, maintenance, or environmental standards.", "See John Hancock Life Ins. Co. (U.S.A.) v. Commissioner, 141 T.C. at 113. Petitioner's expert Prof. McDermott also concluded that the contractual terms of the test transactions mitigated many risks of ownership, including technological obsolescence, failure of utility assets, long-term market value changes, failure of payments, and changes in Government or regulatory requirements.", "With respect to sublease and assignment restrictions, CPS could always ask petitioner for consent, the same as for improvements that could materially affect the value of the leased property.", "In fact, in 2004, when CPS decided to build Spruce II, which would share the site and some facilities with the Spruce station, petitioner gave its consent after a short site visit and receipt of a written confirmation from CPS that the construction was not going to affect the Spruce station value.", "Petitioner did not bother to visit the site after Spruce II was finally completed and started to work.", "Next, we do not find that petitioner's own due diligence efforts are indicative of any ownership rights.", "Respondent points out that petitioner had to complete the due diligence process within the strict time limits imposed by section 1031.", "As a result, petitioner did not follow up on certain red flags raised in engineering reports. Moreover, Mr. Roling and others in petitioner's tax department only cursorily reviewed the tax opinion packages prepared by Winston & Strawn.", "Mr. Berdelle, who testified that he read the entire Winston & Strawn tax opinion, did not act on or inquire about inconsistencies therein of which petitioner was, or should have been, aware.", "In most prior SILO/LILO cases taxpayers also engaged in extensive due diligence before to entering into the transactions, including hiring prominent law firms to draft documents, accounting firms to structure transactions and provide appraisals, and engineering firms to evaluate the properties.", "See, e.g., ConEd I, 90 Fed.

That nonetheless did not prevent the courts in those cases from holding that the substance of such transactions was inconsistent with their form and that the taxpayers did not obtain genuine attributes of ownership.", "See, e.g., ConEd II, 703 F.3d at 1378-1379, 1381 (discussing the appraisal prepared by Deloitte and concluding that it was insufficient to support the taxpayer's contentions and was boilerplate; holding that the taxpayer failed to obtain genuine attributes of ownership to support the claimed deductions).", "Finally, petitioner argues that it faced a substantial risk of loss in the event of CPS bankruptcy despite the available credit enhancements.", "Petitioner attempts to distinguish these cases from the SILO and LILO transactions in John Hancock on this ground because in John Hancock none of the tax-exempt counterparties were subject to the limitations stated in section 502(b)(6) of the Bankruptcy Code.", "Respondent maintains that this risk was illusory and petitioner would be able to recover its investment even if section 502(b)(6) of the Bankruptcy Code limited the recovery available through the bankruptcy proceedings.", "Sec. 502(b)(6) of the Bankruptcy Code limits a lessor's claim for liquidated damages in bankruptcy resulting from the termination of a lease of real property to an amount not to exceed three years' rent plus any unpaid rent due under the lease at the time a debtor files its bankruptcy petition.", "We agree with respondent. Petitioner's claim is inconsistent with the record and is a mere attempt to blow out of proportion the risk of loss in the event of CPS' bankruptcy.", "First, according to FCLC, petitioner's credit adviser, CPS was generally very creditworthy. FCLC opined that the payment obligations and associated risks had been effectively identified and supported by credit enhancements so even in the case of CPS' bankruptcy petitioner would be able to fully recover its investments from the credit enhancement providers.", "In 2000 CPS had one of the highest credit ratings in the country, and had cash on hand of over $450 million and a reserve fund surety policy in excess of $225 million.", "The City of San Antonio itself would have to file for bankruptcy before CPS became bankrupt. As of 2000 there had never been a failure of a major municipality in the history of the State of Texas.", "PwC explained that there was \"bulletproof assurance\" to Unicom that there was no practical exposure to loss during the first nine months of the CPS transaction, and that CPS' going bankrupt within the first six months of the transaction was commercially impossible.", "In addition, CPS obtained sufficient credit enhancements to secure the risk of rent nonpayment or early sublease termination.", "We find that petitioner's speculations on what might happen if CPS filed for bankruptcy do not add anything of substance to our analysis.", "No transaction is absolutely protected from all possible risks, including catastrophic economic events or destruction of property \"by a biblical flood or a superbolide meteor\".", "UnionBanCal Corp., 113 Fed. Cl. at 135. The record here supports respondent's argument that petitioner faced a risk of loss only in such a catastrophic event.", "We do not consider this risk sufficient to hold that petitioner had genuine attributes of ownership during the Spruce sublease term.", "Petitioner's own expert Mr. McDermott stated in his expert report that the bankruptcy of a municipal utility is a relatively low-probability event but has occurred in other jurisdictions.", "We also find that petitioner was sufficiently protected from the risk of economic loss if the Spruce sublease terminated early.", "The sublease agreement contained provisions that guaranteed that petitioner would receive stipulated loss value payments in the event of CPS' default.", "These payments were predetermined and set forth in a schedule to the Spruce sublease agreement. The payments would be made out of the funds set aside at the closing date pursuant to the CPUA.", "Petitioner argues that in case of an early Spruce sublease termination petitioner would have to return any unaccrued prepaid rent to CPS.", "This argument ignores the fact that after netting the unaccrued prepaid rent and the stipulated loss value, petitioner would still recover its full investment in the lease, including transaction fees and interest through the time of default.", "As Mr. Berdelle explained in a memorandum prepared for the Unicom board meeting on April 4, 2000, requesting the approval of the like-kind exchange plan,", "[t]he stipulated loss values also include additional earnings protection of about $3 million per each $100 million of initial investment.", "example, if there was a default on both the MEAG and CPS transactions (about $1.6 billion), Unicom would receive its investment and about $48 million pretax income in the year of default as earnings protection.", "The Spruce transaction documents were drafted to reflect this understanding. We are thus satisfied that petitioner did not face any significant risks indicative of genuine ownership during the Spruce sublease term.", "We next consider whether petitioner acquired the benefits and burdens of ownership in the light of the options available to petitioner and CPS at the end of the Spruce sublease period.", "First, we decide whether CPS was reasonably expected to exercise its cancellation option at the end of the Spruce sublease period.", "If it was, petitioner's profit was fixed at the outset of the Spruce transaction and petitioner did not acquire any benefits and burdens of ownership with respect to the Spruce station.", "See John Hancock Life Ins. Co. (U.S.A.) v. Commissioner, 141 T.C. at 139-143.", "Petitioner relies primarily on the Deloitte Spruce appraisal to show that CPS was not \"economically compelled\" to exercise the cancellation option at the end of the Spruce sublease.", "This is so, as petitioner sees it, because the cancellation option price was set above the expected future fair market value of the Spruce plant at the end of the Spruce sublease term.", "To support the Deloitte appraisal findings, petitioner invited several experts to submit expert reports and testify during the trial.", "Respondent relies primarily on the analyses of Dr. Skinner to argue that because CPS is a tax-exempt entity, it valued the Spruce station at a much higher level.", "Dr. Skinner asserts that there are a number of flaws with the Deloitte appraisal, including the very high corporate income tax rate and discount rate.", "Dr. Skinner suggested that because CPS was a tax-exempt entity, it would be more appropriate to use a 0% corporate income tax rate and a discount rate equal to CPS' weighted average cost of capital, about 6.1%.", "This would result in a much higher projected value for the Spruce plant at the expiration of the sublease.", "Dr. Skinner explained that because CPS did not pay dividends to its shareholders, the appropriate weighted average cost of capital should be based on the interest CPS usually paid on its bonds.", "At the beginning of our analysis, we specify what constitutes \"reasonable likelihood\" that a purchase option will be exercised at the end of the sublease period.", "We reiterate that this Court does not require an \"inevitable\", \"economically compelled\", or similar threshold for purchase option exercise likelihood in evaluating SILO/LILO transactions.", "See id. at 95-97.

United States, 113 Fed.", "Petitioner asserts that the Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit compared the option exercise price to the anticipated fair market value of the leased assets expected as of the closing of the lease in determining whether a transaction constitutes a true lease.", "See, e.g., In re Marhoefer Packing Co., Inc., 674 F.2d 1139, 1144-1145 (7th Cir. 1982) (considering whether option price was \"nominal\" in comparison to the fair market value of leased assets at the time the option could be exercised \"as anticipated by the parties when the lease *", "* * [was] signed,\" for purposes of determining whether the lease should be recharacterized as a security interest); M & W Gear Co. v.

These cases lead petitioner to assert that \"the appropriate standard for analyzing a lessee's purchase option must focus on objective economic realities and whether those realities compel exercise or strongly favor exercise to a degree of certainty.\"", "We do not find that the cases petitioner cites establish a legal standard incompatible with this Court's analysis in John Hancock and require economic compulsion or circumstances that \"strongly favor exercise to a degree of certainty.\"", "In M & W Gear Co. v. Commissioner, 446 F.2d at 844-845 (discussing in detail evidence regarding the intent of the parties), the Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit considered not only the comparable sale prices for the leased assets, but the intent of the parties at the time of entering the transaction.", "In In re Marhoefer Packing Co., Inc., 674 F.2d at 1141, the same Court of Appeals discussed only the issue of whether a specific lease in question with a $1 purchase option qualified as a true lease or a security under the provisions of the Uniform Commercial Code.", "This discussion is not pertinent here because it does not pertain to any tax law issues. Finally, none of the cases petitioner cites involve a lease supported by defeasance arrangements where both a lessee and a lessor would have certain options at the end of the lease and where the lessee would have some obligations under options available to the lessor.", "Thus, we will follow the legal standard of \"reasonable likelihood\" that this Court has adopted in John Hancock following the Courts of Appeals for the Second Circuit and the Federal Circuit.", "As to comparing the option exercise price to the estimated future value of the asset in the context of SILO/LILO transactions, this Court previously explained in John Hancock Life Ins.

First, Deloitte used the 9% State corporate income tax rate in all appraisals for test transactions.", "According to Deloitte, \"[t]he 9 percent tax rate represents the appropriate corporate income tax rate in the state of Texas' stepped tax rate schedule based upon tax year and taxable amount.\"", "In the context of the Spruce transaction, this statement sounds odd. Texas does not impose a State corporate income tax.", "It is possible that the cashflows from the Spruce plant thus would be taxed at a different rate. This could potentially increase the value of the Spruce plant in both 2000 and 2032.", "However, we do not think this flaw necessarily fatal to the Spruce appraisal.", "If we calculate the present value of a stream of revenue equal to $100 per year at 10% discount rate and with a 40.85% tax rate over a period of 30 years and compare the results with the present value of the same revenue stream taxed at 35%, the difference will exceed $50.", "We note, however, because the tax rate affects the numerator in the present value calculation, slight fluctuations in the tax rate may not have a significant enough effect to require completely discarding an appraisal as unreliable.", "To compare, a 1% change in the discount rate, which affects the denominator, would also bring up by $50 the present value of the revenue stream above.", "Second, we find that Winston & Strawn attorneys interfered with the appraisal process' integrity and independence by providing Deloitte with the wording of the conclusions it expected to see in the final appraisal reports.", "Deloitte confirmed in its engagement letter that \"[t]he appraisal will be conducted in conformity with the * * *", "[USPAP] of the Appraisal Foundation and the Principles of Appraisal Practice and Code of Ethics of the American Society of Appraisers.\"", "USPAP ethics rules require an appraiser to \"perform assignments with impartiality, objectivity, and independence, and without accommodation of personal interests.\"", "Appraisal Foundation, Uniform Standards of Professional Appraisal Practice 2 (1999).

According to petitioner, Deloitte's appraisal team was known for its expertise and experience in the appraisal field.", "There was no reason for concern that Deloitte was unaware of the existing guidance on characterization of leases for Federal tax purposes.", "We see Winston & Strawn's letter dated December 29, 1999, informing the Deloitte team of the conclusions the law firm needed to see in order to issue an opinion at the requisite level as an attempt to obtain certain results.", "Our finding is supported by a pattern of communications between Winston & Strawn and Deloitte where Winston & Strawn provided regular feedback at all stages of the project, starting with Deloitte's engagement letter.", "Petitioner asserts, and Deloitte's representative, Mr. Ellsworth, testified on this point at trial, that Deloitte arrived at the fair market value of the assets at issue independently.", "Nonetheless, even if that is true, Deloitte also performed the appraisal of the relinquished power plants, Powerton and Collins.", "Deloitte therefore was aware of the amount of untaxed gain petitioner was looking to defer. This further undermines the reliability of the appraisal reports Deloitte provided for all test transactions.", "Further, in analyzing the likelihood of cancellation option exercise by CPS, Deloitte failed to consider the costs of a potential subsidy CPS would have to pay to a qualified bidder or operator to entice such a bidder/operator to enter into an operating agreement or PTPA with petitioner if the energy industry does not fare as well as expected.", "Prof. Myers, however, considered such costs and concluded that in most cases CPS would still be better off taking the money and returning the Spruce station to petitioner.", "As to the likelihood of the cancellation option's exercise, it is unhelpful to petitioner's argument that Deloitte failed to consider the costs that CPS would have to incur to bring the Spruce plant to the required (per the Spruce sublease agreement) minimum operation standards for estimated annual capacity, net energy output, and efficiency.", "Meeting these requirements is a prerequisite for CPS to return the Spruce station to Exelon at the end of the sublease term.", "According to the Spruce sublease agreement, if CPS were to fail to deliver the Spruce station meeting the minimum operating and efficiency requirements, it would have to pay the diminution of fair market value or will be given another chance to exercise the cancellation option.", "Prof. Myers also failed to take these costs into consideration in his analysis.", "Thus, the price of failing to exercise the cancellation option for CPS would consist of (1) undertaking investments required to bring the Spruce station into compliance with the minimum operating standards and other return requirements; (2) securing a replacement property or source of electricity and related costs; and (3) potential subsidies to qualified bidders and transaction costs should Exelon decide to exercise the operating agreement or the service agreement options.", "To be more specific, CPS and petitioner agreed that if CPS decided to return the Spruce station at any time during the sublease or at the end of the sublease term in 2032, the Spruce station was required, at a minimum, to have an annual ratio of the actual net generation to the normal claimed capacity of at least 82% (capacity factor), operating for 8,760 hours per year.", "The Spruce station was also required to have the ratio of available generation to maximum generation of at least 89% and have an annual ratio of the heat energy output of not more than 10,950 Btu/kWh.", "Deloitte and Prof. Myers, however, used significantly lower capacity factors in their computations. These figures were based on Deloitte's due diligence of the Spruce station and the engineering reports provided by Stone & Webster.", "Both Deloitte and Prof. Myers assumed the plant capacity factor to be 90.3% in 2000, with gradual decline to 58.7% in 2032 (the end of the sublease term) and to 49.6% in 2052 (end of the Spruce headlease).", "These numbers, according to Prof. Myers, reflected the gradual obsolescence of the plant.", "Discounted cashflow analysis performed by Deloitte and Prof. Myers incorporated the plant capacity factor and the hours of operation to determine the cashflows from the Spruce plant and determine its value in 2032.", "This \"real Spruce plant\", however, was not what petitioner was entitled to receive at the end of the Spruce sublease period.", "Petitioner was entitled to receive, because CPS had agreed to deliver, a plant that would operate in 2032 at a plant capacity factor 23% greater than anticipated by petitioner's experts.", "This \"hypothetical Spruce plant\" would, therefore, generate a much higher revenue stream and would have a value significantly higher than the value projected by Deloitte and Prof. Myers.", "According to the Deloitte appraisal, the plant capacity factor for Spruce would go down to 72.2% by year 16 of the sublease, with the available hours of operation going down to 6,325.", "Deloitte estimated that the Spruce plant would operate at these levels up to year 30 of the sublease, and at year 31 of the sublease the Spruce plant capacity would be at 58.7%, with hours of operation at 5,139 per year.", "If the Spruce plant continued to operate throughout the term of the sublease at a minimum return requirements level (82% capacity factor and 8,760 operation hours per year), the cashflows in years 16-32 of the sublease would be at least 10% to 23% higher than anticipated by Deloitte.", "We also do not find reliable the Spruce plant value determined under the cost approach in the Deloitte appraisal.", "It is clear the appraisal considered the cost of purchasing an asset that would not meet the minimum operating requirements under the Spruce sublease agreement.", "Therefore, we conclude that the plant Exelon was entitled to receive at the end of the sublease term had characteristics distinctly different from those assumed by Deloitte and Prof. Myers.", "Although the parties did not submit any evidence regarding the amounts CPS would be required to invest in the Spruce station to meet the return standards, the requirement to do so significantly changes the economics of the Spruce transaction.", "We note that Prof. Myers stated in his analysis that \"a capacity factor 20% above [Deloitte] forecasts would move the return vs. cancel boundary up enough to include the base-case scenario [in Prof. Myers' analysis that petitioner would retain the plant].\"", "What Prof. Myers has not considered in his analysis, however, is how the parties allocated the risks and costs related to the diminution in the power plant efficiency.", "According to the Spruce transaction agreement documents, that risk was shifted to CPS. As we explained, if the Spruce plant failed to meet the minimum operating standards at the time it was returned to Exelon, CPS would have to either pay up the diminution in fair market value or exercise the cancellation option to cut its losses.", "Under the circumstances, we find it significantly more likely that CPS, should it attempt to walk away from the transaction and return the Spruce station to Exelon, would face substantial economic losses.", "Accordingly, we find that the range of scenarios under which CPS would decide to exercise its cancellation option is significantly broader than expected by petitioner's experts, including Prof. Myers.", "We also find that both petitioner and CPS, experienced power plant operators having the benefit of professional legal and other advice, understood that the terms of the Spruce transaction were inconsistent with the Deloitte appraisal and the projected future value of the Spruce station.", "The parties understood that it would be very difficult, if not impossible, for CPS to return the Spruce plant at the end of a 32-year sublease in almost the same condition in which CPS received it in 2000 without significant investment.", "Thus, the parties understood and reasonably expected at the time of entering into the Spruce transaction that CPS would exercise the cancellation option at the end of the sublease because meeting the return conditions would be extremely burdensome.", "According to Prof. Myers' analysis, with the required capacity factor of 82% in 2032, more than 20% higher than projected in the Spruce appraisal, it would be economically beneficial for CPS to exercise its cancellation option.", "Moreover, we note that when the City of San Antonio brought suit in court to obtain a declaratory judgment of the continued validity of certain covenants in its outstanding public securities--thereby allowing CPS to enter into the transaction with petitioner--in its initial draft of the petition the city represented that it intended to exercise the cancellation option.", "Even though this representation was subsequently deleted at the suggestion of Winston & Strawn and PwC, this Court infers an understanding among the parties that CPS would exercise the option to reacquire the Spruce plant.", "At the very least, it was reasonably likely at the time of the transaction that the purchase option would be exercised.", "We hold that the Spruce transaction fails the substance over form inquiry because petitioner did not acquire the benefits and burdens of ownership of the Spruce station.", "Petitioner's investment was not subject to more than a de minimis risk of loss. We need not consider the risks and benefits to petitioner of the remaining headlease period because it was reasonably likely that the circular flow of money allowing petitioner to fully recover its investment and interest would close on the last day of the Spruce sublease.", "We agree with respondent that the transaction most closely resembles a financial arrangement. Specifically, the Spruce transaction resembles a loan from Exelon to CPS.", "Exelon funded the Spruce transaction entirely with its own funds and received the funds back with interest in two tranches: the first tranche six months after the closing date and the second tranche at the end of the Spruce sublease term in the form of the cancellation option payment.", "Exelon's return on its investment was predetermined, and Exelon did not have an upside potential or much of downside risk with respect to the Spruce station.", "This is more indicative of a loan than of a genuine equity investment.", "Accordingly, we sustain respondent's disallowance of Exelon's depreciation deductions claimed on the 2001 tax return with respect to the Spruce transaction.", "Because the Scherer and Wansley transactions are structured and documented very similarly, we discuss them together.", "We use the same analysis framework as for the Spruce transaction.", "Petitioner and respondent make the same arguments for the Scherer and Wansley transactions as for the Spruce transaction.", "First, as we noted in discussing the Spruce transaction, a 100% out-of-pocket investment does not necessarily make a transaction nonabusive from a tax standpoint.", "Here, petitioner indeed used the untaxed proceeds from the sale of the Powerton station and did not use any loans to finance the Scherer and Wansley transactions (collectively, MEAG transactions).", "However, petitioner got 77.9% of its initial investment back just six months after the closing of the MEAG transactions in the form of prepaid rent from MEAG.", "A portion of the remaining 22.1% of the initial investment was placed into a trust account and invested in low-risk securities to provide for the payment of the MEAG purchase option at the end of the sublease period for MEAG transactions.", "Another portion was set aside to provide MEAG with the NPV benefit in consideration for entering into the transactions.", "For the same reasons we discussed for the Spruce transaction, we do not find that an out-of-pocket investment automatically shows that petitioner acquired benefits and burdens of ownership of Scherer and Wansley stations.", "This is especially important when six months into the transaction petitioner was in substantially the same cash position as with using loans to finance the leases.", "Second, similarly to the Spruce transaction, we do not see the rights and obligations conveyed by the Scherer and Wansley respective headlease and sublease agreements as significantly altering the rights of the parties.", "Petitioner did not have any obligations to MEAG with respect to the maintenance, operation, or insurance of the Scherer and Wansley stations during the sublease term or the remainder of the headlease.", "Petitioner also did not have to meet any return conditions in the case of headlease termination. The rights and obligations of the parties under the Scherer and Wansley subleases were essentially the same as in the Spruce transaction, with MEAG bearing all the costs and risks related to the interests in the stations it conveyed to petitioner in the MEAG transactions.", "As we observed in the discussion of the Spruce sublease, the terms of the sublease agreements were designed to insulate petitioner from any operational risks.", "Third, similar to the Spruce transaction, we do not find that petitioner's due diligence efforts are somehow indicative of a true ownership interest in the Scherer and Wansley stations.", "We also do not find any merit in petitioner's argument that it was exposed to a risk of MEAG's going bankrupt during the Scherer and Wansley sublease terms.", "Petitioner received an opinion from Holland & Knight that confirmed that the laws of the State of Georgia did not allow municipalities to declare bankruptcy.", "Petitioner's own expert, Dr. Gilson, confirmed in his expert report that Georgia would have to change its laws to allow MEAG to declare bankruptcy.", "We consider this scenario highly unlikely. See UnionBanCal Corp., 113 Fed. Cl. at 135 (discussing that highly unlikely risks do not add substance to a LILO transaction).", "In any event, credit enhancements put in place at the outset of the MEAG transactions provided petitioner with sufficient protection from that risk.", "We find that petitioner also did not face a substantial risk of loss with respect to the payment of the Scherer and Wansley rent by MEAG.", "The rent was prepaid six months into the sublease term, and the stipulated loss value provisions, together with MEAG and UII swaps, insulated petitioner from any significant risk of loss in this respect.", "We now turn to an analysis of whether it was reasonably likely that at the closing of the Scherer and Wansley transactions MEAG would exercise its purchase option.", "Similarly to the Spruce transaction, we will look not only at fair market value of the assets involved as of the option exercise date, but also to the costs to MEAG if it decides to forgo exercising the option.", "We will also briefly address the rights of the Scherer and Wansley coowners, who also received a right to exercise the purchase option if MEAG decided to forgo it.", "Neither petitioner nor respondent argues that there are legal, political, industrial, or technical reasons that would weigh in favor of or against MEAG's exercise of its purchase option.", "Thus, we consider financial and economic aspects of the MEAG transactions first.", "According to the Deloitte appraisal, the undivided interests petitioner received under the MEAG transactions were estimated to have fair market values of $203,800,000 for Wansley and $485,000,000 for Scherer using a discounted cash flow analysis, adjusted for inflation at 2.5% per annum, at the respective lease expiration dates.", "The Wansley purchase option price was set at $214 million, and the Scherer purchase option price was set at $537.1 million, with $143,543,915 and $179,284,424 allocable to the Wansley and Scherer test transactions, respectively.", "Because the Deloitte appraisals and expert reports addressed the Wansley transactions without allocating the values between Wansley 1 and 2, we will use the aggregate analysis and will assume that the projected value of the Wansley interest conveyed in the test transaction bears the same ratio to the overall projected value of the Wansley as the purchase option exercise value for the test transaction to the overall purchase option price.", "The cost approach inflation-adjusted values are $191,300,000 for the Wansley and $481,000,000 for the Scherer interest.", "For the same reasons we discussed supra note 26, we will be using the discounted cashflow results.", "The Deloitte appraisals for the Scherer and Wansley stations suffer from the same deficiencies we identified in our review of the Spruce appraisal.", "Deloitte elected to use the 40.85% corporate tax rate that included a 9% State corporate tax rate, even though MEAG does not pay income tax (and even if it did, Georgia taxes its corporations at a flat 6% rate).", "Winston & Strawn attorneys were very closely involved in the appraisal report preparation process. Deloitte did not consider the costs MEAG would have to incur if it decided not to exercise the purchase option, including the costs of bringing the plants up to the required operating standards.", "Deloitte also did not consider any additional factors that could make MEAG's cotenants consider exercising the purchase options, including obtaining majority control over the Scherer and Wansley stations.", "Petitioner's expert witnesses made the same arguments as for the Spruce transaction. Mr. Reed opined that it was impossible to predict with a degree of certainty whether MEAG or its cotenants would exercise the purchase options at the end of the Scherer and Wansley subleases.", "Ms. Hughes opined that the Deloitte appraisals conformed with the USPAP principles and the Deloitte analysis was reasonable and appropriate.", "Prof. Myers conducted the sensitivity analysis of the Deloitte appraisals and confirmed that if the inflation or electricity prices were higher than predicted by Deloitte, it would increase the likelihood of MEAG's exercising the purchase options.", "Prof. Myers concluded that MEAG would never purchase Wansley or Scherer in order to avoid the cost of a PTPA subsidy.", "Prof. Myers also recognized that changes in other factors, including capital investments, capacity factors, and discount rates will affect MEAG's decision.", "We also note that Prof. Myers used a different corporate tax rate (38.9%) for the Wansley and Scherer transactions.", "His discounted cashflow results, however, were comparable to those in the Deloitte appraisal reports because of several adjustments made by Prof. Myers, such as capital investments.", "Respondent's expert witness Dr. Skinner suggested that Deloitte should have used a 0% corporate tax rate to analyze the MEAG transactions and used a 6.3% discount rate based on cost of debt to MEAG.", "Dr. Skinner also suggested that Deloitte should have conducted sensitivity testing at least for corporate rates.", "With the new assumptions, Dr. Skinner concluded that MEAG would value the Scherer and Wansley stations a lot higher than the purchase option price and thus would be almost certain to exercise the purchase option.", "For similar reasons as those we discussed for the Spruce transaction, we agree that Deloitte should have used a 0% corporate tax rate and the prevailing discount rate in its analysis.", "As with the Spruce transaction, a further problem with the Scherer and Wansley appraisals is that Exelon was entitled to a operating efficiency of Scherer and Wansley at the end of the sublease significantly higher than the values used by Deloitte in the respective appraisals.", "If the Scherer and Wansley stations did not meet the minimum operating requirements outlined in the respective subleases, MEAG would have to pay damages reflecting the diminution in the value of the stations due to decreased efficiency.", "Deloitte and Prof. Myers failed to consider these costs in analyzing whether MEAG would exercise the purchase options at the end of the Scherer and Wansley subleases.", "For Wansley, petitioner was entitled to receive, because MEAG had agreed to deliver, the Wansley station at the end of the sublease with a capacity factor of at least 62% based on 8,760 hours of operation per year with the net energy output of at least 85%.", "The Wansley appraisal by Deloitte and Prof. Myers' report assumed a plant capacity factor of only 66.5% in 2000, declining to 39.2% in 2028 (Wansley sublease expiration year) and to 32.6% in 2045.", "These numbers were based on the engineering reports prepared by Stone & Webster.

Both petitioner and MEAG had vast experience with operation of power plants.", "Both petitioner and MEAG had the benefit of legal, tax, and other professional advice before and at the time of entering the transaction.", "Both petitioner and MEAG agreed to the return conditions set out in the Scherer and Wansley sublease contracts and understood the importance of the minimum operating standards.", "Thus, it was reasonably likely at the time the MEAG transactions were entered into that MEAG would exercise the purchase option at the end of the Scherer and Wansley subleases, because meeting the return conditions would be extremely burdensome, if not impossible, for MEAG.", "Petitioner may argue that Exelon faced a risk that MEAG would not have sufficient funds to pay the purchase option exercise price.", "We observe that indeed MEAG replaced the collateral pledged to Ambac Credit and Exelon under the UII and MEAG swaps with MEAG's own debt.", "We also observe, however, that both Ambac Credit and petitioner consented to such an exchange. Ambac Credit and petitioner would not have consented to the collateral replacement if they had anticipated they would have any problems with the payment at the end of the sublease term.", "In fact, one of the goals of replacing the collateral was to replace the Government securities, which did not give sufficient yield in the beginning of the 2000s, with relatively secure but higher yield instruments.", "Because MEAG could not declare bankruptcy under the laws of Georgia, we find that petitioner did not bear any significant risk of nonpayment at the end of the sublease periods for the Scherer and Wansley stations.", "One of the significant differences between the MEAG transactions and the Spruce transaction is that MEAG's cotenants in the Wansley and Scherer stations received the right to exercise the purchase option at the end of the subleases should MEAG fail to do so.", "Petitioner and respondent did not put much emphasis on that right in their briefs. Prof. Myers, petitioner's expert, concluded that cotenants would use the same analysis as MEAG to decide whether to exercise the purchase options.", "We agree with this statement, but we also emphasize that the cotenants may have some other significant considerations that may make it more likely that they will step in and purchase the interests in the Scherer and Wansley stations if MEAG fails to do so.", "This further insulates petitioner from the risk of loss in the MEAG transactions or a risk of MEAG's nonpayment.", "We hold that the Wansley and Scherer transactions fail the substance-over-form inquiry because petitioner did not acquire the benefits and burdens of ownership of the Scherer and Wansley stations.", "It was reasonably likely at the time the MEAG transactions were entered into that MEAG or its cotenants would exercise the purchase options at the end of the sublease term.", "Accordingly, we do not need to consider the risks and benefits to petitioner of the remaining headlease periods.", "We agree with respondent that the MEAG transactions most closely resemble financial arrangements. Specifically, the MEAG transactions resemble loans from Exelon to MEAG because Exelon's income was predetermined and the transaction did not have an upside potential or significant downside risks for Exelon.", "Because Exelon funded the transactions with its own funds and there are two distinct tranches of money it expected to receive back, it is appropriate to characterize each transaction as creating two loan instruments: one to be repaid six months after the closing date in the form of prepaid rent, and the second to be repaid at the time of the purchase option payment.", "Accordingly, we sustain respondent's disallowance of Exelon's depreciation deductions claimed on the 2001 tax return with respect to the Spruce transaction.", "Respondent further asserts that we should disallow petitioner's depreciation, interest, and transaction cost deductions claimed on the 2001 tax return because the test transactions lacked economic substance.", "Respondent did not directly challenge the 1999 like-kind exchange gain deferral under the economic substance doctrine.", "Because we resolve the issues related to the disputed deductions claimed in petitioner's 2001 tax return on substance over form grounds, we need not address this alternative theory.", "IV. Consequences for the 1999 Tax Year Section 1031 Like-Kind Exchange Adjustment", "Section 1031(a)(1) provides: \"No gain or loss shall be recognized on the exchange of property held for productive use in a trade or business or for investment if such property is exchanged solely for property of like kind which is to be held either for productive use in a trade or business or for investment.\"", "The regulations further explain that \"the words 'like kind' have reference to the nature or character of the property and not to its grade or quality.", "One kind or class of property may not, under * * * section [1031], be exchanged for property of a different kind or class.\"", "We have held that all of the test transactions failed the substance over form inquiry because petitioner did not acquire the benefits and burdens of ownership in the assets involved in the test transactions.", "We have also concluded that the test transactions are more similar to loans made by petitioner to CPS and MEAG because petitioner's return on its investment was predetermined at the time petitioner entered into the test transactions.", "Accordingly, in 1999 petitioner exchanged the Powerton and Collins power plants for an interest in financial instruments.", "Such an exchange fails to meet the \"like kind\" requirement outlined in the Code and the regulations. Thus, petitioner must recognize the gain it received in 1999 on the sale of the Powerton and Collins plants under section 1001.", "V. 2001 Interest Expense Deductions and Rental Income", "Six months after the closing of the test transactions, petitioner received prepayment of all rent from CPS and MEAG due under the respective sublease agreements.", "Petitioner reported the rent payments as income according to the provisions of section 467.", "Section 467 governs the reporting of rental income from rental agreements that are treated as leases for Federal income tax purposes and which either have increasing or decreasing rents, or prepaid or deferred rents.", "See sec. 467(d)(1) ; Sec. 1.467-1(c), (h)(12), Income Tax Regs. If a rental agreement constitutes a section 467 rental agreement, the lessor and the lessee must take into account only the sum of the section 467 rent and interest during the taxable year.", "We have concluded that petitioner did not acquire the benefits and burdens of ownership in the Spruce, Wansley, or Scherer plant.", "We have also concluded that the test transactions most closely resemble financial arrangements in the form of loans from petitioner to CPS and MEAG.", "Thus, the agreements among petitioner, CPS, and MEAG are not lease agreements for Federal tax purposes under section 467, and petitioner may not deduct interest or include rental income with respect to them for the taxable year 2001.", "This is consistent with our conclusion that petitioner failed to enter into a like-kind exchange in 1999 and must recognize the gain on the sale of the Powerton and Collins stations.", "VI. Original Issue Discount and Transaction Expenses", "A taxpayer receives OID income when a debt instrument is issued for less than its face value. See Sec. 1273;", "United States v. Midland-Ross Corp., 381 U.S. 54, 85 (1965); and John Hancock Life Ins. Co. (U.S.A.) v. Commissioner, 141 T.C. at 147.", "\"The holder of a debt instrument with OID generally accrues and includes in gross income, as interest, the OID over the life of the obligation, even though the interest may not be received until the maturity of the instrument.\"", "John Hancock Life Ins. Co. (U.S.A.) v. Commissioner, 141 T.C. at 147 (citing section 1272(a)(1)).", "Respondent argues that petitioner has OID income arising out of petitioner's equity contribution that would be repaid through the cancellation/purchase options with interest.", "Respondent suggests that such contributions should be treated in the same manner as a zero-coupon bond.", "Respondent further contends that the terms of each test transaction established a guaranteed, fixed return to Exelon through the use of defeasance instruments.", "Respondent maintains that we should follow the same approach as in John Hancock, where this Court upheld the Commissioner's recharacterization of a number of SILO transactions as in substance a loan from the taxpayer to the counterparties and applied the OID rules.", "Petitioner's main argument is that the test transactions should be characterized as leases, not loans, and thus petitioner does not have any OID income.", "For the reasons set forth in the previous portions of the opinion, this argument lacks merit. Because petitioner, CPS, and MEAG reasonably expected that the respective cancellation/purchase options would be exercised at the end of the sublease period, the purchase option price was fixed, and the funds for payments set aside (defeased) as of the closing date, the transactions represent fixed obligations similar to those discussed in John Hancock.", "Accordingly, we uphold respondent's application of the OID rules and his calculation of OID income thereunder.", "In addition, we note that because each transaction was fully funded by petitioner's money and created two distinctive tranches of money--one payable in six months, one at the end of the respective sublease term--each tranche should be treated as a separate debt instrument under the OID rules.", "Ordinary and necessary business expenses paid or incurred in carrying on any trade or business are generally deductible.", "See sec. 162(a). We have concluded as to all test transactions that they are properly characterized as loans from petitioner to CPS and MEAG.", "We also concluded that for each transaction, the loan consisted of two tranches, one due six months after the closing date, the other due at the time of the cancellation/purchase price option payment.", "Under section 1.1273-2(g)(4), Income Tax Regs., transaction costs must be included as an additional amount lent to the borrowers.", "See also John Hancock Life Ins. Co. (U.S.A.) v. Commissioner, 141 T.C. at 149. Thus, petitioner's transaction costs related to the test transactions are not deductible and should be allocated to the respective loans.", "The parties are further directed to address the issue of transaction cost allocation in Rule 155 computations.", "We recognize that there may be several ways to approach this issue. One way would be to allocate transaction costs pro rata to the amounts of the respective loans.", "The other way would be to allocate expenses on the basis of the billing records and invoices of petitioner's advisers related to the transactions at issue.", "Section 6662(a) and (b)(1) and (2) imposes a 20% accuracy-related penalty on the portion of an underpayment of tax attributable to negligence or disregard of rules and regulations or a substantial understatement of income tax.", "The accuracy-related penalty does not apply to any portion of an underpayment for which a taxpayer had reasonable cause and acted in good faith.", "This Court previously held that the statutory provisions shifting the burden of production to the Commissioner with respect to penalties are inapplicable to corporations.", "See NT, Inc. v. Commissioner, 126 T.C. 191, 195 (2006) (holding that section 7491(c) does not apply to a C corporation's liability for a penalty, an addition to tax, or an additional amount).", "Petitioner in the consolidated cases before us is a corporation. Thus, the provisions of section 7491(c) do not apply.", "Respondent determined accuracy-related penalties pursuant to section 6662(a) of $86,234,918 for the 1999 tax year and $1,106,922 for the 2001 tax year in the respective notices of deficiency.", "Respondent determined these penalties on the grounds of negligence and disregard of rules and regulations and substantial understatements of income tax.", "Respondent has conceded the substantial understatement of income tax grounds for the 2001 tax year.", "Petitioner argues that no penalty is appropriate in these cases because petitioner was not negligent, did not disregard any applicable rules and regulations, and acted reasonably and in good faith when relying on the tax advice of its advisers, who adequately considered all relevant law under the applicable standards at the time of the transactions.", "In addition, petitioner asserts that the OID income cannot be included in the penalty computations because this argument has only recently been introduced and developed by the Commissioner and the courts, and petitioner could not anticipate such an assertion in 1999 and 2000, at the time of closing the transactions.", "B. Negligence or Disregard of Rules and Regulations", "We will address the issue of negligence or disregard of rules and regulations first because it was determined as the ground for penalties in both notices of deficiency on which these cases are based.", "Section 6662(a) and (b)(1) imposes a 20% penalty on any portion of an underpayment of tax attributable to negligence or disregard of rules or regulations.", "Negligence includes \"any failure to make a reasonable attempt to comply with the provisions of the internal revenue laws or to exercise ordinary and reasonable care in the preparation of a tax return.\"", "Sec. 1.6662-3(b)(1), Income Tax Regs. Negligence is \"strongly indicated\" when the taxpayer fails to make a reasonable inquiry into correctness of an item that appears \"too good to be true.\"", "Disregard includes \"any careless, reckless or intentional disregard of rules or regulations,\" which includes \"the provisions of the Internal Revenue Code, temporary or final Treasury regulations * * * and revenue rulings or notices (other than notices of proposed rulemaking) issued by the Internal Revenue Service and published in the Internal Revenue Bulletin.\"", "Id. subpara. (2). Disregard is \"careless\" if the taxpayer does not use \"reasonable diligence to determine the correctness of a [tax] return position that is contrary to the rule or regulation.\"", "Id. Disregard is \"reckless\" if the taxpayer \"makes little or no effort to determine whether a rule or regulation exists under circumstances which demonstrate a substantial deviation from the standard of conduct that a reasonable person would observe.\"", "Id. Finally, disregard is \"intentional\" if a taxpayer knows of the disregarded rule or regulation. Id.", "However, the penalty does not apply to any portion of an underpayment for which a taxpayer had reasonable cause and acted in good faith.", "See sec. 6664(c)(1). This defense can be established through reasonable and good-faith reliance on advice received from a competent tax professional.", "See United States v. Boyle, 469 U.S. 241, 250-251 (1985); sec. 1.6664-4(b)(1), Income Tax Regs.", "Respondent argues that petitioner failed to make a reasonable attempt to comply with the existing tax laws and failed to exercise ordinary and reasonable care in the preparation of the tax returns for the years at issue.", "Respondent asserts that Exelon should have known that the like-kind exchange and the test transactions provided it with a result \"too good to be true\" and should have evaluated the transactions more carefully.", "Respondent also asserts that Exelon was aware that LILO transactions were already under scrutiny from the IRS and did not sufficiently closely review the tax opinions provided by Winston & Strawn at the time of entering into the transactions.", "Petitioner, in turn, argues that it conducted a thorough due diligence of all aspects of the like-kind exchange and test transactions before deciding to engage in them.", "Petitioner also argues that it reasonably relied in good faith on the advice it received from its advisers on the various aspects of the transactions, including tax treatment.", "Because the issue of whether petitioner under section 6662(a) was negligent or disregarded rules or regulations is so closely intertwined in these cases with whether petitioner under section 6664(c) reasonably and in good faith relied on advice it received from tax professionals, we consider the two issues together.", "It is well recognized that taxpayers may establish that they should not be liable for a section 6662 penalty if they acted in good faith and reasonably relied on advice of a tax professional.", "Reliance on a professional tax adviser, however, does not automatically establish reasonable cause and good faith.", "Sec. 1.6664-4(b)(1), Income Tax Regs. Instead, all facts and circumstances must be taken into account, including the taxpayer's knowledge and experience and the reliance on the advice of a professional.", "Id. In the case of reliance on an opinion or advice, the facts and circumstances inquiry should account for \"the taxpayer's education, sophistication and business experience,\" as well as whether \"the taxpayer knew, or reasonably should have known, that the advisor lacked knowledge in the relevant aspects of Federal tax law.\"", "To show that reliance on advice of a tax professional constitutes reasonable cause, the taxpayer must prove by a preponderance of the evidence the following three requirements: (1) the adviser was a competent professional who had sufficient expertise to justify reliance, (2) the taxpayer provided necessary and accurate information to the adviser, and (3) the taxpayer actually relied in good faith on adviser's judgment.", "Neonatology Assocs., P.A. v. Commissioner, 115 T.C. 43, 99 (2000), aff'd, 299 F.3d 221 (3d Cir. 2002).", "Reliance may be unreasonable when it is placed upon insiders, promoters, or their offering materials, or when the person relied upon has an inherent conflict of interest that the taxpayer knew or should have known about.", "Id. at 98. In addition, the advice must not be based on unreasonable factual or legal assumptions and must not unreasonably rely on representations, statements, findings, or agreements of the taxpayer or any other person.", "Petitioner claims it reasonably relied in good faith on Winston & Strawn's tax advice and therefore no accuracy-related penalty should be imposed.", "Respondent contends that petitioner's reliance on Winston & Strawn was unreasonable and not in good faith because Winston & Strawn was too involved in the structuring of the transactions to provide a reliable tax opinion.", "First, we will analyze the factors outlined in Neonatology. The record in these cases and the testimony of the parties establishes that petitioner carefully considered various factors, including necessary expertise in tax, in selecting its tax adviser.", "Winston & Strawn, in petitioner's opinion, was a strong firm possessing the necessary qualifications and expertise in handling similar deals.", "We do not find that Winston & Strawn was so involved in structuring the transaction that reliance on its tax opinions was per se unreasonable.", "Petitioner contacted Winston & Strawn to provide advice on the transaction, and there is no evidence that Winston & Strawn had a conflict of interest in rendering its advice.", "Winston & Strawn billed its normal hourly rates, and its fee did not depend on the closing of the test transactions.", "Cf. Kerman v. Commissioner, T.C. Memo. 2011-54, slip op. at 43 (finding that a tax opinion was burdened with an inherent conflict of interest where the fee for it was based on the amount of loss generated for the taxpayers in a CARDS transaction), aff'd, 713 F.3d 849 (6th Cir. 2013).", "Thus, petitioner met the first prong of the Neonatology test.", "As to the second prong of the Neonatology test, the parties do not dispute that Winston & Strawn was closely involved in the transactions and knew all the relevant facts to render a tax opinion.", "Respondent does not allege that petitioner misrepresented any material facts to Winston & Strawn, and the record does not contain any indicia that this was the case.", "However, as we discussed above, Winston & Strawn's tax opinions were based in large part on the appraisals prepared by Deloitte.", "We found that Winston & Strawn interfered with the integrity and the independence of the appraisal process by providing Deloitte with a list of conclusions it expected to see in the appraisals to be able to issue tax opinions at the \"will\" and \"should\" level.", "Such interference improperly tainted the Deloitte appraisal, rendering it useless. Further, because Winston & Strawn directed the conclusions that Deloitte had to arrive at, we are highly suspicious that the tax opinions are similarly tainted.", "We also concluded that the technical and engineering assumptions used in the Deloitte appraisals were inconsistent with the return conditions specified in the test transaction documents, which made the exercise of the purchase/cancellation options considerably more likely.", "Winston & Strawn, as the firm that drafted the transaction documents and was closely involved in all stages of the test transactions, knew or should have known of this defect and that its tax opinions were therefore based on unreasonable assumptions and arrived at unreasonable conclusions in the light of how the transactions were actually structured.", "The third prong of the Neonatology test requires the taxpayer to show that it relied in good faith on the adviser's judgment.", "There is a longstanding policy of not requiring taxpayers to second-guess the work of a tax professional providing the advice.", "As the Supreme Court has stated, \"[t]o require the taxpayer to challenge the attorney, to seek a 'second opinion,' or to try to monitor counsel on the provisions of the Code himself would nullify the very purpose of seeking the advice of a presumed expert in the first place.\"", "Boyle, 469 U.S. at 251; see also Bruce v. Commissioner, T.C.

The team reported its findings to petitioner's board of directors, and the board approved the transactions.", "Although the board did not have the benefit of reviewing the final versions of the tax opinions, it did have a chance to ask questions of the Winston & Strawn team as well as the PwC team.", "In addition to Winston & Strawn, petitioner engaged PwC (financial and accounting adviser), Arthur Andersen (accounting adviser), Sidley Austin (regulatory counsel), Deloitte (valuation), Stone & Webster (engineering and environmental adviser), Vinson & Elkins (Texas counsel), and Holland & Knight (Georgia counsel).", "Petitioner's employees and the board, however, had other considerations in mind as well: They were under pressure to find a reasonable solution to the problem of higher-than-anticipated revenue from the sale of its fossil fuel power plants.", "The clock on the section 1031 transaction was ticking, and the amount at stake--over $1.6 billion of potentially taxable sale proceeds--was too significant to let the like-kind exchange plan fall apart.", "Our analysis of the test transactions shows that petitioner knew or should have known that CPS and MEAG were reasonably likely to exercise their respective cancellation/purchase options because they would not be able to return the Spruce, Scherer, and Wansley power plants to petitioner without incurring significant expenses to meet the return requirements.", "It is true that Winston & Strawn provided a very favorable tax opinion on the test transactions, notwithstanding the obvious inconsistency of the return provisions and the projected plant capacity factor at the end of the respective subleases.", "Yet we are not persuaded that Winston & Strawn's tax opinion can serve as a shield for petitioner under the circumstances.", "We believe that petitioner fully recognized that a plant with a capacity factor of 82%--the minimum rate at which the Spruce station had to be running when returned by CPS upon expiration of the sublease--would be worth significantly more than the same plant with a capacity factor of 58%--the capacity factor used in the Deloitte appraisals.", "Petitioner, as a sophisticated power plant operator, must have appreciated that it would be very expensive for CPS to sufficiently upgrade the plant to meet the capacity requirements.", "Thus, petitioner must have understood that Winston & Strawn's tax opinions, based on the Deloitte appraisals, were flawed.", "See supra note 29 for a fuller explanation of these numbers. The difference in capacity factors for MEAG transactions was in the same range.", "This brings us to two conclusions: first, petitioner could not have relied on the Winston & Strawn tax opinions in good faith because petitioner, with its expertise and sophistication, knew or should have known that the conclusions in the tax opinions were inconsistent with the terms of the deal.", "Second, in the light of the previous conclusion, petitioner's alleged reliance on Winston & Strawn's tax advice fails the Neonatology test.", "Petitioner also alleges that it relied on its auditor, Arthur Andersen, to raise red flags about the transactions.", "According to petitioner, Arthur Andersen had no objections or challenges to petitioner's reporting of the like-kind exchange.", "Unlike petitioner, Arthur Andersen did not have the benefit of vast experience in operating power plants and may have overlooked the issue of return conditions.", "The record is also silent as to what documents related to the transactions were actually reviewed by Arthur Andersen and to what extent.", "We are thus not persuaded by petitioner's argument. --------", "We note that petitioner expended significant resources on due diligence and consulting fees related to the like-kind exchange and the test transactions.", "However, we find troubling petitioner's cavalier disregard of the risks connected with the test transactions and the underlying facts.", "Mr. Berdelle, petitioner's controller and a senior employee with substantial discretionary and strategic authority, testified that he had read the Winston & Strawn tax opinions and was otherwise intimately involved in the decisionmaking process behind the proposed transaction.", "In addition, Winston & Strawn had advised petitioner of certain tax risks that could accompany the proposed transactions, and indeed petitioner registered the test transactions as a confidential corporate tax shelter around the same time it entered into the transactions.", "It is true that Mr. Roling and other employees of petitioner besides Mr. Berdelle had only cursorily read the opinion package prepared by Winston & Strawn.", "This fact on its own might be sufficient to demonstrate a failure by petitioner to exercise ordinary and reasonable care in entering into the transaction and preparing the related tax returns.", "However, considering that petitioner (1) was a sophisticated taxpayer, (2) claims to have read the Winston & Strawn tax opinions in their entirety, (3) knew or should have known that Winston & Strawn's tax opinions based on the Deloitte appraisal reports were flawed, (4) was apprised of the risk that the proposed transactions might be classified as corporate tax shelters and registered them as such with the IRS around the same time it entered into the test transactions, and (5) proceeded with the transactions anyway, we find that petitioner disregarded the applicable rules and regulations.", "At a minimum, petitioner carelessly disregarded the rules and regulations by failing to \"exercise reasonable diligence to determine the correctness of a return position.\"", "See sec. 1.6662-3(b)(2), Income Tax Regs.

We hold that the OID income should be included in the calculation of the underpayment subject to the section 6662 penalty for the 2001 tax year.", "We have considered all of the arguments that petitioner made, and to the extent not discussed above, conclude that those arguments not discussed herein are irrelevant, moot, or without merit.", "We have considered respondent's arguments only to the extent stated herein.", "We note that the cost approach would result in lower projected future fair market value according to Deloitte appraisals for the test transactions.", "We will use the discounted cashflow analysis because petitioner relied mostly on discounted cashflow in pricing the Spruce, Scherer, and Wansley transactions.", "We believe this will provide us with more consistent results."]}
