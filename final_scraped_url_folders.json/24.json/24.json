Additionally, he noted that scrutiny over the tech world appears to have shifted towards the Big Tech platform companies, at least for the time being.", "Over the last several years, the industry has seen increasing numbers of anti-suit injunctions, anti-anti-suit injunctions and the proliferation of a complex litigation playbook covering SEP FRAND licensing.", "When asked if this sort of atmosphere is conducive to signing new deals, Rogers said there is some concern—especially if global FRAND determinations are deemed acceptable for determining the appropriateness of injunctive relief.", "Still, he said, how big of a problem this is will depend on whether tech companies can receive good, fair hearings under all jurisdictions.", "Rogers went on to voice support for the utilization of arbitration to settle SEP FRAND disputes, calling it a \"good, less hostile, less litigious way to resolve a licensing issue.\"", "For someone who has followed Qualcomm throughout the years and closely watched the FTC hearings, it was fascinating to get another insider perspective from the man leading QTL's strategy.", "By beating back the antitrust suit, Qualcomm has helped turn the tide away from prior, harmful licensing regulations and pushed the industry into a world where innovation is encouraged and IP is adequately protected and monetized.", "QTL and Rogers have been instrumental in these efforts, and the industry at large—especially other creators of IP—should be grateful.", "Note: Moor Insights & Strategy writers and editors may have contributed to this article.", "Moor Insights & Strategy, like all research and analyst firms, provides or has provided paid research, analysis, advising, or consulting to many high-tech companies in the industry, including 8x8, Advanced Micro Devices, Amazon, Applied Micro, ARM, Aruba Networks, AT&T, AWS, A-10 Strategies, Bitfusion, Blaize, Box, Broadcom, Calix, Cisco Systems, Clear Software, Cloudera, Clumio, Cognitive Systems, CompuCom, Dell, Dell EMC, Dell Technologies, Diablo Technologies, Digital Optics, Dreamchain, Echelon, Ericsson, Extreme Networks, Flex, Foxconn, Frame (now VMware), Fujitsu, Gen Z Consortium, Glue Networks, GlobalFoundries, Google (Nest-Revolve), Google Cloud, HP Inc., Hewlett Packard Enterprise, Honeywell, Huawei Technologies, IBM, Ion VR, Inseego, Infosys, Intel, Interdigital, Jabil Circuit, Konica Minolta, Lattice Semiconductor, Lenovo, Linux Foundation, MapBox, Marvell, Mavenir, Marseille Inc, Mayfair Equity, Meraki (Cisco), Mesophere, Microsoft, Mojo Networks, National Instruments, NetApp, Nightwatch, NOKIA (Alcatel-Lucent), Nortek, Novumind, NVIDIA, Nuvia, ON Semiconductor, ONUG, OpenStack Foundation, Oracle, Poly, Panasas, Peraso, Pexip, Pixelworks, Plume Design, Poly, Portworx, Pure Storage, Qualcomm, Rackspace, Rambus, Rayvolt E-Bikes, Red Hat, Residio, Samsung Electronics, SAP, SAS, Scale Computing, Schneider Electric, Silver Peak, SONY, Springpath, Spirent, Splunk, Sprint, Stratus Technologies, Symantec, Synaptics, Syniverse, Synopsys, Tanium, TE Connectivity, TensTorrent, Tobii Technology, T-Mobile, Twitter, Unity Technologies, UiPath, Verizon Communications, Vidyo, VMware, Wave Computing, Wellsmith, Xilinx, Zebra, Zededa, and Zoho which may be cited in blogs and research."]}

Agreement” Under Its Belt, Acacia’s Wi-Fi 6 Campaign Reaches More Defendants", "Acacia Research Corporation released its full-year 2021 and Q4 earnings last week, reporting $51.3M in licensing and related patent revenue during the fourth quarter—which it said was driven in large part by the licensing of its Wi-Fi 6 portfolio.", "The announcement was followed in short order by two new suits asserting patents from the same portfolio, filed by Acacia’s Atlas Global Technologies LLC this week against D-Link and Unizyx (Zyxel).", "Atlas Global’s April 4 complaints filed against D-Link (2:22-cv-00103) and Unizyx (Zyxel) (6:22-cv-00355) in the Eastern and Western Districts of Texas, respectively, assert an identical set of nine former NEWRACOM patents.", "The NPE has previously asserted overlapping sets of those same nine patents, plus a tenth (see a patent assertion grid here), against defendants ASUSTek, OnePlus, Samsung, SerComm, and TP-Link.", "With them, Atlas Global has targeted compliance with the 802.11ax networking standard by a long list of accused products including adapters, cameras, desktop computers, e-readers, laptops, mini PCs, motherboards, smartphones, set-top boxes, and televisions—and as in the recent complaints against D-Link and Zyxel, various networking devices (i.e., access points, gateways, routers, and stations).", "Atlas Global’s patents-in-campaign were among the over 200 US patents that the NPE received from chip maker NEWRACOM in February 2021.", "Formed in 2014 by a group of individuals from the Electronics and Telecommunications Research Institute (ETRI), NEWRACOM is described in Atlas Global’s complaints as a “major contributor” to the 802.11ax-2021 standard, citing a 2018 IAM Industry Report that ranked NEWRACOM “as the world’s fourth most active technical contributor to the 802.11ax Standard, behind only Qualcomm, Intel, and Huawei”.", "Atlas Global began its campaign in August 2021, suing ASUSTek (headquartered in Taiwan) and Sercomm (also based in Taiwan) in the Western District of Texas and Samsung (headquartered in Korea) in the Eastern District of Texas.", "Last November, the NPE added a suit against OnePlus (based in China) in West Texas and another, against TP-Link (also Chinese), in East Texas.", "While the NPE’s campaign has been somewhat bogged down by challenges related to service on foreign defendants—covered by RPX here—by the end of 2021, Atlas Global had resolved one of its cases: In November, Acacia announced a license agreement with Samsung, ending litigation against the company by early December (and two days before Atlas Global assigned five of its NEWRACOM patents to Samsung).", "This past week, Acacia reported IP revenue of $51.3M for the fourth quarter of 2021, compared to $4.4M during the same period in 2020.", "In a March 31 earnings call, Acacia’s CFO Rich Rosenstein attributed that increase to the “successful licensing” of Acacia’s Wi-Fi 6 portfolio—results which, according to CEO Clifford Press, “reinforces [Acacia’s] confidence about achieving future licensing agreements”.", "When questioned by an analyst, Press called the transaction “foundational” and “extremely important in validating the importance of the portfolio and the value of it”.", "Acacia’s IP business generated $76M in revenue for the year ended December 31, 2021, up from $29.8M for the full year of 2020.", "Other than the agreement with Samsung announced in November, the company did not provide any details about licenses and settlements signed in 2021, other than saying that a few were inked (“including one large settlement”) in Q2.", "As reported by RPX here, more than a handful of patent infringement cases were dismissed during that quarter.", "Acacia has been relatively quiet on the litigation front so far this year, filing just two new cases (the Atlas Global suits against D-Link and Zyxel), and it has not announced any new patent acquisitions since picking up the NEWRACOM portfolio in 2021.", "During Q&A with analysts on March 31, CFO Rosenstein said that Acacia’s goal is “to acquire one or more operating companies” in 2022.", "In Q4, the company announced that it had acquired Printronix Holding Corp., described as “a leading manufacturer and distributor of industrial impact printers, which are also known as line matrix printers, and related consumables and services”.", "Acacia reports paying $33M in cash for the business.", "Also last year, Acacia made a bid to acquire Comtech Telecommunications, described as a “global provider of next-generation 911 emergency systems and secure wireless communications technologies”, for $790M in cash.", "First reported by Reuters on November 1, Acacia’s offer to buy Comtech was confirmed in an 8-K filing the following day, in which Acacia disclosed that it had submitted a private proposal to acquire 100% of the outstanding shares of Comtech for $30 per share in cash.", "Acacia’s bid came as Comtech was facing pressure from Outerbridge Capital Management, one of its major shareholders, to “refresh” its board of directors and consider a potential “whole or partial sale” of the company.", "Apparently referring to an October 25 letter from Outerbridge to Comtech’s board, Reuters reports that “Comtech angered Outerbridge last month when it announced a deal to sell a $100 million stake in itself through a PIPE deal to hedge funds Magnetar Capital LLC and White Hat Capital Partners LP.", "In a PIPE deal, investors buy a publicly traded stock below its currently traded price”.", "Comtech issued a press release in January stating that its board had unanimously rejected Acacia’s unsolicited offer.", "Acacia itself underwent an activist investor-led transformation in 2018, when Sidus Investment Management and BLR Partners prevailed in a proxy campaign for changes at the company, including the election of their director nominees, Clifford Press (cofounder of the investment company Hyde Park Holdings) and Alfred Tobia Jr. (cofounder of Sidus Investment Management) to the company’s board.", "Shortly after Press and Tobias joined Acacia’s board in 2018, an executive turnover began, with the ousting of Acacia’s president, CFO, and general counsel, and the eventual departure of each of its remaining directors.", "A strategic shift—initially characterized as an “absolute return asset management strategy”—followed, part of which has involved a renewed focus on patent portfolio acquisition and assertion.", "That acceleration continued through Acacia’s partnership with hedge fund Starboard Value, opening up access to as much as $500M in new capital.", "Acacia’s company’s cash, cash equivalents, and equity investments totaled $670.7M at December 31, 2021, compared to $274.6M at December 31, 2020.", "Shares of Acacia’s stock were trading at $4.58 at the close of business on April 8, giving the company a market valuation of $207M."]}

We’ll now move over to Q&A. Out of respect for others on the call, we request that participants please only ask one question.", "KEITH WEISS, Morgan Stanley: Excellent, thank you guys for taking the question, and very impressive results in a very difficult environment that we’re all dealing with, particularly when it comes to those commercial cloud bookings.", "You talked about the largest ever number of big deals that you guys were able to sign in Q4. Typically, we think this type of environment makes it harder to sign those big deals.", "Can you talk to us a little bit about how you got that done? Was the consolidating impact that Microsoft brings to the market, the price performance, maybe the macro, is that actually a benefit for you guys to close these deals in this type of environment, or was it just kind of a typical Q4 end of year kind of budget flush kind of thing for you guys, and it was absent of the environment or not really related to the environment?", "SATYA NADELLA: Thank you, Keith, for the question. It was a record even for us, even with the context of Q4.", "So, there’s obviously something going on in the macro environment, which does feel that it does plays to our strengths.", "There are two things at least I would observe. One is, whether the bookings number or the MACC deals and the size of the MACC deals and the number of them, I think speak to very much what we have been talking about for a long time now, which is as a percentage of GDP, IT spend is going to increase because every business is trying to fortify itself with digital tech to, in some sense, navigate this macro environment.", "So that, I think, is probably what is reflected in those numbers.", "And then the second aspect is also what you just referenced, which is we do have every layer of the tech stack, right, whether it’s infra, data, hybrid work, security, even Power Platform.", "In each one of these, we do have this best-of-suite value, which includes best-of-category products, and that is leading to share gains.", "So if you want to bet on a window on a long-term basis, where you have that best-of-suite value, and then you’re able to sort of consume it on your terms, I think that that’s effectively what some of those numbers are indicators of.", "KEITH WEISS, Morgan Stanley: Outstanding. Thank you, guys.", "BRETT IVERSEN: Thanks, Keith. Jessi, next question, please.", "MARK MOERDLER, Bernstein: Thank you very much, and congratulations on the quarter. I’d like to follow up a little bit on that.", "With all the concerns about macro recession, everyone’s trying to understand how cloud, and from Microsoft’s case more specifically, IaaS, PaaS operates in a slowdown recession.", "How do you think about Azure’s resiliency? How do you think about Azure’s exposure to advertising business, consumer Internet and SMB if we do see a real recession?", "SATYA NADELLA: Yeah, maybe I’ll start, and Amy, feel free to add. I mean, overall, we’re not immune to what’s happening in the macro broadly, right, to Keith’s question and your question Mark.", "I think I’d say I’d start there, because whether it’s on the demand side with consumers or SMBs, I think Amy in her remarks talked about some of that, even in our results in the quarter.", "But what’s happening with it in Azure, though, is in some sense, businesses trying to deal with the overall macroeconomic situation and trying to make sure that they can do more with less.", "For example, moving to the cloud is the best way to shape your spend with demand uncertainty, right, because in fact, if anything, one of the things that we’re seeing is an increased shift towards the cloud, and then of course, optimizing your bill.", "We are incenting even our own field to ensure that the bills for our customers come down. And that, in fact, even shows up in some of the volatility in our Azure numbers, because that’s one of the big benefits of the public cloud.", "And that’s why I think, coming out of this macroeconomic crisis, the public cloud will be even a bigger winner, because it does act as that deflationary force.", "So, that’s sort of what we are seeing in the Azure numbers. We will be exposed to consumer driven businesses and SMBs, but at some level, our strength as a company is much stronger in the core commercial.", "The other one is also people building new applications that are completely new frontier. I mean, there are two numbers that I talked about.", "One is the triple digit growth in Cosmos DB, and triple digit growth in Container App Services. You take those two things, and you say, what are people doing?", "People are writing applications at a completely different frontier of efficiency, which is a cloud-native, serverless, container-based types of applications.", "And so, to me, that’s another way for you to make sure that your IT spend goes a long way in a time like this.", "BRETT IVERSEN: Thanks, Mark. Jessi, next question, please.", "BRENT THILL, Jefferies: Amy, great to hear the double-digit guidance. I guess many are asking are you embedding a worsening macroenvironment or a similar environment that we’re in to get to that type of growth?", "AMY HOOD: Thanks, Brent. As I said, it’s trying to take into account the current macroenvironment. And as I said, I took what we saw in June, applied it as best we thought we could through the course of the fiscal year.", "And if you think about how the… and if you try to look over the course of the year with some of my comments, you’d say, okay, in H1 vs. H2, I would point out three things that changed a bit over the course of that time.", "First, of course, if we’re talking about USD, it would be FX. It’s a bigger headwind in H1; it’s less of a headwind in H2.", "The second thing I would point to would be OpEx. As we’ve talked about in H1, we’ve obviously added .2%", "headcount this quarter. We still have 11,000 hires that we have started in Q1. We’ve still got Nuance and Xandr in acquisitions, and we anniversary, a lot of that as we focus our hiring and focus on the productivity of all the hiring we’ve done over the past year, and then the OEM comparables obviously get a lot different when you get from H1 into H2.", "And so, as you’re trying to think about the shape, and how did I consider it, I sort of took those things into account, thought about the trends we’ve been seeing in June and applied them as best we can.", "BRETT IVERSEN: Thanks, Brent. Jessi, next question, please.", "KARL KEIRSTEAD, UBS: Thanks very much. I’d love to probe a little bit more on Azure. Amy, you and Satya talked about a very robust, large new deal activity.", "I thought your guidance for Azure constant currency growth in the September quarter of a 3-point decel to 43 is fairly solid.", "But you did mention that in the June quarter, you experienced a little bit of consumption softness. Do you mind explaining what that was and when you put all this together, how you’re feeling about the Azure business in the next couple of quarters in terms of the slope of the likely deceleration?", "AMY HOOD: Thanks, Karl. Maybe I’ll start and then, Satya, you obviously should add on to the commentary.", "I would point you, Karl, really to some of the things Satya mentioned and we said in our comments. We did see some deceleration, a point a little more than we had expected in the consumption side.", "Through the course of Q4, it really applied across all customer segments and in general, applied across geographies.", "We saw customers, as Satya discussed, much like they always do, focused on optimization and continuing to think about which new workloads to prioritize and start.", "We’ve really taken that frame and applied it as we thought to H1, and specifically to Q1 in that guidance.", "It does assume continued consumption deceleration of 3 points, quarter to quarter.", "I still feel very good about the patterns we’re seeing. I feel good about the workloads that Satya mentioned and where we feel like we can take some share, but at the same time, we really are focused on taking the agreements that we signed in Q4, making sure we’re working with the customers on deployment, projects that have quick time to value, investing to make sure they’re starting the projects that can save them money, that can help them innovate.", "And I think that’s probably our larger focus rather than just the pure consumption number.", "BRETT IVERSEN: Thanks, Karl. Jessi, next question, please.", "RAIMO LENSCHOW, Barclays: Thank you. Along those lines on the customers kind of having slightly different spending priorities as they kind of try to maneuver this environment, can you talk a little bit more about what you’re seeing in Office, because obviously, Office E5, you’re offering a much more comprehensive solution that is kind of getting very, very competitive on several aspects?", "What are you seeing there in terms of your willingness of customers to kind of use this time to kind of consolidate further?", "SATYA NADELLA: Yeah, maybe I’ll just start, and Amy, you can add. I mean, the two numbers that are user growth numbers, right, the 14% growth in the number of seats of Microsoft 365, and then the E5 growth of 60%, I think speak to, again, that best-of-suite value in the core and in E5.", "So, we’re very competitive on both of those and that’s what you’re seeing in that seat growth.", "AMY HOOD: And I think what I would point to, maybe, just to add a little bit, as you can see, I do think we’ve been building momentum, really, with E5.", "There’s so much value, and we’ve added and continued to add value to the E5 suite. And as that value has become more and more competitive, both at the category level and at the suite level, we’re very focused on making sure customers get every bit of value in that SKU, so focused on deployment, increasing usage, moving resources there.", "Some of our investment that we’ve spent over the past six months and looking forward for hiring will be in those areas to make sure we are helping customers get the most out of that SKU.", "In the team and in Q4, and specifically in some of the bookings numbers, E5 was a strong point in terms of both renewals and people adding E5 to their existing contract.", "RAIMO LENSCHOW, Barclays: Makes sense. Thank you. Congrats.", "BRETT IVERSEN: Thanks, Raimo. Jessi, next question, please.", "PHIL WINSLOW, Credit Suisse: Hi, thanks for taking my question. Congrats on the strong quarter.", "Amy, I just wanted to focus in on your comments about capital spending, but also just utilization within Azure and obviously, some of the supply chain issues as mentioned before.", "What is the sense of sort of where utilization stands for around Azure and as you think about sort of demand trends relative to supply chain.", "How are you feeling about sort of where capacity stands right now? And is this actually driving any changes in your customer behavior, whether it be increased focus on reserved instances, etcetera?", "AMY HOOD: Thank you. Maybe let me start by talking about Q4’s capital spend. Obviously, the big driver of our growth this quarter was in datacenter spend, both new builds as well as adding capacity to existing datacenters.", "We are seeing, obviously, good demand signal. So hence, we’ve guided to another strong spending quarter in Q1 in terms of capital.", "Though it’s a sequential decline, I would think about that more as being timing. It always can move around a little bit, just based on when builds are complete or when shipments come in.", "We do feel that we’ve gotten in a good place on capacity on a global basis and are focused on making sure our customers can drive the new units they need, the new usage they need in those datacenters.", "I don’t know, Satya, if you wanted to add on anything to that.", "SATYA NADELLA: Yeah. I mean, I think that you’ve captured it right, and it is also right that customers are using more reserved instances.", "And so, that’s essentially a price discount, right? That’s the kind of optimization that you see. So, we are growing.", "The growth numbers we are posting in consumption is with all that optimization in place.", "BRETT IVERSEN: Thanks, Phil. Jessi, next question, please.", "KIRK MATERNE, Evercore ISI: Hi, thanks very much for taking the question. Amy, you noted a couple times just seeing some weakness in more the small business segment.", "Can you just talk about what’s going on there? Is that an opportunity for you all to go in and try to sell or more bundles and your suite?", "I guess how much of a drag has that been and do you see it getting better or worse? So just if you could just add a little bit more color on that part of your business, it’d be helpful.", "AMY HOOD: That’s a great question, Kirk. I did allude to it a couple of times when discussing Office EMS or the Azure per-user service as well as Windows Commercial.", "And, of course, that is because it’s all related to selling Microsoft 365. And we did see, as I noted, some weakness in new deals, particularly in the SMB segments outside of E5.", "To your point, think of them as SKUs it really intended, right, for that type of audience and customer base.", "And it came from a couple of things, Kirk, one of which we talked about before, is that that is primarily sold through partner.", "And so, we need to make sure we’ve got the best value props. We’ve got to make sure the price is right, offers right, and make sure that we are tuning that value prop to what small business customers need today, which is great value.", "And so, we’ll keep executing that through partner. We’re in the middle of that transition we talked about last quarter, and we’re still working on it.", "The second thing is I would also say that is a spot where you tend to see macro-weakness show itself.", "And we alluded to that as well in my comment, because while I can’t tell you in particular which part of that is some of the partner transition work we’re doing versus macro, it certainly feels like both.", "And so, that’s certainly a spot that we’re watching. I think your point around making sure we’ve got the right lead, which is absolutely do more with less, and that we can help you both modernize and get great value through the suites, but it’s an important caveat to that.", "But you saw the way it shows itself, as you might notice, is you saw the seat growth be a little lighter than you would have expected in the quarter.", "And then in Q1, that shows itself as a little bit of decel in that Office 365 growth number quarter to quarter.", "BRETT IVERSEN: Thanks, Kirk. Jessi, we have time for one last question.", "ALEX ZUKIN, Wolfe Research: Hey, guys, thanks for sneaking me in. I guess I wanted to double-down on the consumption commentary with respect to Azure specifically.", "I guess, do you feel as though clearly the guidance, I think, has a very confident posture. When you think about your visibility into those consumption dynamics, is it that you’re seeing customers optimize their spend?", "Are you seeing them commit to longer duration contracts? And therefore, you’ve kind of see the different linearity of that consumption pace?", "And then if you think about it on a global basis, are there any different patterns domestically versus internationally in those moderating projects starts, or just general optimization conversations?", "AMY HOOD: Maybe I’ll start and let Satya add. When we talked about it, what we saw in June and through the quarter, and then as we’re thinking about Q1, is we have seen that deceleration in consumption apply really across customer segments.", "And in general, it was across geos. I wouldn’t point in particular to any specific geo as showing a very different pattern than any other geo.", "And certainly, we’ve not applied that logic, as we look into Q1.", "I do think it speaks to what Satya and I have said, which is we see customers continuing to optimize, whether it’s through reserved instance, whether it’s through existing workloads or purchase patterns.", "And I expect that to continue, which is absolutely what the guide implies. And it implies that these Azure commitments that we signed through the course of the year, because it takes time to convert those large contracts until actual consumption and new project growth as that work gets completed, both at the customer and with our help, you’ll start to see new projects add as the plots to the optimization that occur.", "So, I would not point to it as being different that we have certainly seen to this point. It’s just a consistent deceleration that we’ve talked about.", "BRETT IVERSEN: Thanks, Alex. That wraps up the Q&A portion of today’s earnings call. Thank you for joining us today, and we look forward to speaking with all of you soon."]}

(and by steal i mean purchase, just like we write about how China is stealing our tech when they purchase patents or by other deep internal means)", "Samsung is in a worse position than intel, not only it is Korean, and they have problems with their northern neighbor, as well as with Japan, but they also got hit by the anti-competitive behavior and trade war from the US, and were told to stop development of their in-house chip (Exynos), to place Qualcomm as a western leader, despite their poor tech", "And i'm not sure if The Verge is a trustable source, they either have insider knowledge or their source is manipulative, because that contradicts with the Exynos story", "If what they claim is true, then that'll be interesting to see if their \"promise\" can become a reality, time will tell", "But as a matter of fact, still nothing is happening in the west, and that was my entire point", ">what do you mean exactly? you meant reunification? i don't see how that could be a problem, we do business with China already, it would just become one of their state, you can still trade with them", "I'm sorry what? A chinese invasion of Taiwan would be catastrophic for the global supply chain. It would require a force a few times bigger than the entire D-Day invasion, and there's no way the chip fabs wouldn't be smouldering ruins afterwards.", "The reason china hasn't already invaded is that it would have a nearly incalculable cost for very little benefit.", "Far better to rattle the sword for the nationalists every so often and trade your way to prosperity.", "It's not in the US's interest for China and Taiwan to reunify, i could see the US sending weapons and missiles, as well as Britain and Israel sending their mercenaries and drones", "But i don't think that's what most Taiwanese want, it would be a literal suicide, it's a small island, they see it as a political affair, not as a military one", "The military view is what the western media want to push for some reasons", "We seen it during the Pelosi visit btw, what's next? help elect a Zelensky bis?

So much investments enables TSMC to actually enable the technology.", "Simple. It takes time to get state of the art, bleeding edge CPU nodes to the point where they can have a consistently high yield of large-die-area chips, such as desktop processors.", "Yields on a new production line are often poor due to the many defects that would take out far too many large chips, but allows decent yields of smaller chips.", "Thus, the typical node starts manufacturing on small chips and works its way upward to larger chips as yields improve.", "But FPGAs, despite being way faster than software, are only ~1/5th to ~1/10th as fast as dedicated silicon, at best, on a small scale.", "An Apple M1 in FPGA would run like it was manufactured 2 decades ago, if not worse.", "Plus, FPGAs get absolutely huge with terrible yields for complex work. RED Cameras have a massive, multi-thousand-dollar FPGA (crossing over $10K as a part), and it is only powerful enough to process their custom video codec and nothing else.", "Still cheaper than designing a custom chip for that considering how niche RED Cameras are, but absolutely stupid for anything broader.", "An FPGA that could run an M1 equivalent would be larger than the laptop, cost over $100K, and be slow as a turtle racing across Oregon.", "They're extremely popular devices, people are actively demanding more from them every single year, companies use these marginal improvements as selling points, and these devices cost upwards of a thousand dollars, bringing a healthy profit.", "I think you hit the nail on the head with the \"storm\" word.", "Phone consumers seem to be a little bit irrational.

Processor efficiency increases, software gets bloated and we are back at square one.", "Every phone in the last decade has been a \"one day\" battery life.", "You hit the nail on the head... a few years back my phone was a de-Googled Motorola running LineageOS.", "It had no push notifications or any third-party apps on it besides Spotify and ProtonMail and I could go several days without charging it.", "My current-generation iPhone has superior hardware in every respect and it's down to 50% after a day of usage.", "You need about 1400 calories a day, 2l of water, a 40x40x180cm box to stand in, somewhere to drain your waste, and a temperature that is about 20-24 degrees.", "Everything else is want and as a society, we agreed that you don't need to justify your want.", "Whether that is a bottle of beer or a new smartphone.", "a rather old opinion: the race for thinness in Apple design has been over for, like, 3-5 years now? They hit a local maxima and also learned when they went too far.", "Now products, like MacBook Pros and iPad Pros, are returning to a bit more of their \"ideal\" sizes.", "The same question applies.

Each defect that resulted was then propagated through the replication cycle.", "Consequently, masks were considered expendable, to be used between five and fifteen times and then discarded.", "These problems led to several attempts at prolonging mask life. One was to make the photomask from harder materials that were more resistant to abrasion.", "Another was to reduce abrasion by reducing or even eliminating the contact force. These efforts did improve mask life to a limited extent, but neither was as effective as optically projecting the photomask image onto the wafer.", "A second reason for the 6502’s higher yield was something MOS Technology referred to as “spot-knocking”[12 page 18], essentially a retouching of point defects in the masks.", "The third reason for higher yields was through Mensch’s design rules — constraints on transistor size and feature spacing — which were conservative and much more tolerant of process variations,[19] a technique which he had learned on his own through experiences at Motorola, along with some lessons about what was and what wasn’t possible to achieve at the company.", "Mensch’s first year at Motorola in 1971 was a rotation through four different departments: Applications, Circuit Design, Process Design, and Marketing.[34]", "At the Marketing department, his supervisor Dick Galloway asked him to put a quote together for IBM for memory chips over a seven year period, with pricing decreasing over time — a fairly complicated document, with lots of numbers that had to be typed accurately.", "So he decided rather than having a secretary type it up and go through the trouble of finding and correcting errors, he would write a FORTRAN program on the Motorola mainframe computer to take in parameters, plug in the numbers into some formulas, and print out the quote on a terminal with a thermal printer, which he then copied onto better paper.", "The Marketing staff asked him how he did it, and when he told them, Galloway said “Bill, we want you to work in the Design Group.”", "“Why is that?” “None of their chips work.

Since this was Rod’s and my third (6501) and fourth (6502) microprocessor designs following the Olivetti 5065 CPU and 6800, we knew what we had to do to make a processor to change the world of processing at the microprocessor level.", "And unlike at Motorola, at MOS Technology there was no handicap in working on a low-cost state-of-the-art microprocessor, no other design groups or customers to worry about avoiding a conflict of interest.", "From the first day the “Rebels” were on the payroll at MOS in Pennsylvania — August 19, 1974, freed from the Ponderous Pachyderm, and motivated to succeed — to bringing MCS 6502 chips into production, ready for sale, it would take just over a year.[12]", "The 6502 was aimed to compete in price against the Intel 4040 in the microprocessor-based control systems market[46], but blew it away in technical specs: the 4040 was a 4-bit processor with a slower maximum clock frequency and required a 15V supply.", "By summer of 1975, MOS Technology was gearing up for an introduction in September at WESCON 75 in San Francisco, and took out ads focused on the 6501:[47]", "Here the story takes one of those legendary turns. Steve Wozniak had been designing the Apple I around the Motorola 6800, but he sees the MOS Technology ad, realizes he can get a better price (even better than a Motorola discount he can take advantage of as a Hewlett-Packard employee[48]), goes to WESCON, and buys a couple of chips from Peddle, who’s selling them in a jar from a suite in a nearby hotel because WESCON won’t let them sell product at the convention[49][10].", "The 6502 is soon in the Apple I design. Only two hundred Apple I computers were manufactured in 1976, but by that time, Wozniak is already thinking about the Apple II, introduced in 1977, which will quickly take off like a rocket, starting the use of the 6502 in the personal computer industry with a bang.", "But before Steve Wozniak and Steve Jobs incorporated as Apple Computer Inc., to bring Woz’s Apple II design to fruition, Wozniak was still an employee of Hewlett-Packard working on electronic calculators.", "Computers? No, calculators. (This is such a “Video Killed the Radio Star” moment in history.)", "MOS Technology was still looking for customers. In September 1976, it was purchased by Commodore, a calculator manufacturer, in a move that, to me, appears to be one of financial desperation… but it set the combined company on an arc that lasted the next 18 years as it crossed into personal computers.", "The magazine New Scientist chronicled the tone of the times in two articles, the first in November 1975 (“Coming of Age in the Calculator Business”):[59]", "… The LSI revolution started by specialist semiconductor suppliers like General Microsystems Inc along the 30 mile strip between San Francisco and San Jose (known nowadays as Silicon Gulch) effectively wiped out the cheap labour advantage of South-East Asia in a single stroke — and ensured that the market for pocket-sized calculators henceforth would be dominated overwhelmingly by US firms.", "By 1971, Bowmar had successfully married a compact LSI chip to a small light-emitting diode (LED) display to provide what was to be the first truly compact, hand-held pocket-sized calculator using a chip developed by Texas Instruments.", "Incredibly, Bowmar was not interested in marketing the pocket calculator itself, and tried instead to sell the idea in turn to most of the leading manufacturers of electro-mechanical calculating machines.", "Commodore was one of the two firms that agreed to market the pocket calculator for them; the other was a home entertainment supplier called Craig.", "So rapid was the take-off in the pocket calculator market that, by the following year, Bowmar was struggling to get back into the business.", "Another original component supplier, American Microsystems, also moved into calculator manufacture in 1972 under the trade name Unicom.", "This “vertical integration”, from the bottom up, then became the fashion. The world’s largest supplier of semiconductor components, Texas Instruments, started manufacturing calculators late in 1972, and was joined by National Semiconductor in 1973.", "While the major semiconductor suppliers were attracted by the large profit margins on finished calculators, the leading calculator assembly houses grew anxious about the supply of components and several consequently began to integrate the business downwards.", "However, the more sensible stopped short of actually manufacturing chips, but designed their own integrated circuits and then farmed them out to other semiconductor suppliers to manufacture for them.", "Though prices were still relatively high (the cheapest four-function machine still cost more than £30 in 1973), the pocket calculator quickly caught the public’s imagination.", "Sales rocketed, and prices crashed accordingly. Between 1968 and 1972, five of the original 18 firms involved in pioneering electronic calculators had dropped out, but 35 new names had joined the ranks.", "Since then, many other big names have fallen by the wayside, including Anita, SCM/Marchant, Rapidata, Summit, Seiko and Sony.", "Even Bowmar ultimately had to file for protection under “Chapter XI” of the US bankruptcy law. Unicom was submerged into Rockwell and Remington Rand departed from the field.", "This year the big vertically integrated calculator firms have seen their profits vanish, and some of the calculator assembly houses are now in really deep trouble.", "Even Commodore is struggling to survive. Two weeks ago the firm reported its end of year results, which showed a \\$4.3 million loss on sales which were up 12 per cent over the year to \\$55.9 million.", "Commodore is now pinning most of its hopes on the European market, which is nowhere near as stagnant as the American market has been lately.", "Only a handful of calculator firms look like surviving the present recession and the names that British retailers quote with confidence include Texas Instruments, Hewlett-Packard, Commodore (CBM), Litronix and Sinclair.", "Vertical integration in itself is no longer seen as the best way of ensuring survival. Certainly firms like Texas Instruments, who make practically all the components that go into their calculators themselves, will continue to dominate the market — not by virtue of their vertical integration but really because of their overall financial strength.", "But given a replacement market of 50 million units per year, the industry is obviously settling down to an era of maturity, which will be dominated by one or two really large suppliers and supported by a number of smaller companies specialising in more innovative designs.", "The prices of pocket calculators are not likely to fall appreciably, but the user will continue to get increasing calculating power for his money.", "Wow! This article was quite prescient, and seems to have got almost everything right, except for that bit about “The prices of pocket calculators are not likely to fall appreciably” — only a year later, Texas Instruments introduced the TI-30 in June 1976 for a \\$24.95 suggested retail price.", "(TI achieved this price point by designing it around a single TI chip, the TMC0981.) The rest, about the consolidation of the industry and anxiety of calculator manufacturers as IC manufacturers got into the calculator business, was right on the money.", "What I have not yet mentioned was that MOS Technology was started in 1969 by Allen-Bradley as a means to second-source TI’s calculator chips.", "Up until the 6502, the bulk of its business was in the calculator chip industry. With TI becoming a dominant force in the calculator industry, as its volumes surged and prices fell, MOS Technology was in trouble.", "Commodore was also in trouble, and at the very least saw a conflict of interest with TI (namely buying second-sourced TI chips when TI was a competitor for finished calculators) which it could solve by purchasing MOS Technology.", "New Scientist covered this in a brief filler article in its September 9, 1976 issue titled “Calculator manufacturer integrates downwards”:[60]", "You will note that there is no mention whatsoever of the 6502; it is only hinted at: (emphasis is mine, along with bracketed annotations)", "Commodore, the Canadian owned American based calculator manufacturer which markets under the name CBM in Britain, has announced its intention of entering integrated circuit component manufacture with a recent take-over.", "Unlike several of its competitors (such as Rockwell, National, and Texas Instruments) who are primarily microcircuit manufacturers but who have also integrated vertically upwards into end-products like calculators, Commodore is integrating downwards in order to protect its supply of components.", "Commodore, quoted at \\$60 million on the New York Stock Exchange, has acquired 100 per cent of the equity of MOS Technology Inc. of Pennsylvania in exchange for a 9.4 per cent equity stake in Commodore.", "MOS Technology is privately owned and valued at around \\$12 million. It has an integrated circuit manufacturing plant in Valley Forge, Pennsylvania.", "MOS Technology has been closely associated with Commodore for some years. The integrated circuit chip that went into CBM’s successful SR36/37 calculator came from MOS Technology, as does the current chip for the SR7919D calculator (a model which is rumoured to have around 25 per cent of the UK scientific calculator market) and others of the current CBM range.", "But the firm not only makes integrated circuits for calculators, it has also lately launched a video game chip for four players and is currently marketing a successful microprocessor", "At present, Commodore produces the art-work for its calculator chips and subcontracts the chip manufacture to outside plants around the world with spare capacity.", "The recent purchase of factories in the Far East has enabled it to assemble electronic watch modules by this subcontracting method.", "But as the up-turn in the economy begins to effect [sic] the consumer electronics industry, less spare capacity is becoming available for this type of subcontracting.", "When considered along with the additional recent purchase of an LED display manufacturing facility, Commodore now has a completely integrated operation.", "But supply chain issues were front and center: even in 1976, electronics companies were having to weigh trade-offs of external vs. internal IC fabrication.", "Internal fabs ensured a stable supply would be available, at the cost of running the fab. External fabs ensured flexibility to deal with demand fluctuations… as long as spare capacity was available.", "(1976 is also notable as the birth of the Taiwan semiconductor industry: an April 1976 deal between the Taiwanese government and RCA led to technology transfer of integrated circuit manufacturing by training 19 engineers from the Industrial Technology Research Institute.)", "MOS Technology became Commodore Semiconductor Group.

caveat, as a single plaintiff—Doggie Dental, a maker of teeth-cleaning chew toys for dogs—was responsible for 289, or just over half, of the operating company defendants added during the quarter.",

137 defendants in Q4 2019 as well.", "The Doggie Dental case follows another “canine hygiene” patent suit brought in Q4 2020 by AquaPaw, which sued around 125 defendants in Q4 over the provision of products designed to keep pets distracted while bathing.", "(PACER data did not reflect those defendants when RPX’s last quarterly report was published, so the Q4 2020 numbers are now higher than

operating companies.", "While that district is ordinarily not a popular patent venue, it took first place as the somewhat anomalous result of that single case filed by Doggie Dental against 289 makers of counterfeit canine hygiene products.", "The Western District of Texas, meanwhile, held second place for overall litigation, the top spot for NPEs, and the third highest for operating companies.", "Trailing West Texas for overall and NPE litigation was the District of Delaware, which in turn was followed by the Eastern District of Texas in both categories.", "As RPX has extensively reported, the rise of the Western District of Texas—the top patent district of 2020 by a wide margin—is largely the work of District Judge Alan D. Albright, whose courtroom has become such a popular destination due to his rather plaintiff-centric posture toward certain types of early motions, including transfer requests and Alice challenges.", "Moreover, his district’s lack of divisional standing rules allows plaintiffs to file directly in their preferred division—specifically, Waco, where they are guaranteed to get Judge Albright as the division’s only judge.", "For this reason, it is perhaps not surprising that Judge Albright presided over by far the largest share of patent litigation in 2020—accounting for 19% of all defendants sued in 2020, leading Eastern District of Texas Judge Rodney Gilstrap, who took a distant second place with 6%.", "While Judge Albright was narrowly outpaced in Q1 2021 by Western District of Pennsylvania Judge Mark R. Hornak, due to the aforementioned Doggie Dental case, he was the top judge for NPE matters by a significant amount, as shown below—presiding over nearly a third of such litigation.", "Judge Gilstrap again held the number-two spot for NPE filings, with less than half of Judge Albright’s defendant count.", "Just behind Judge Gilstrap were three of Delaware’s district judges: Maryellen Noreika (herself a former patent litigator, like Judge Albright), Colm F. Connolly, and Richard G. Andrews.", "With respect to Judge Albright’s treatment of early motions, convenience transfers—a form of relief that he has rarely granted since taking the bench in 2018—spurred the most debate in Q1.", "In particular, a rift has grown between Judge Albright and the Federal Circuit over the handling of such transfer requests, a divide that has drawn attention to both how he weighs the various factors in any convenience analysis and, increasingly, his tendency to let those motions sit undecided for months while proceeding with other issues, particularly claim construction.", "The latter trend finally came to a boil in March 2021, following a series of rulings in which the Federal Circuit highlighted those delays with increasing firmness—leading Judge Albright to announce that he will now rule on interdistrict transfer motions before holding a Markman hearing.", "COVID-19 Update: Judge Gilstrap Resumes In-Person Trials, While Washington Court Holds First Virtual One", "District courts have diverged from one another on their handling of patent jury trials during the COVID-19 pandemic—and some of the nation’s top patent judges have been forced to reassess their practices as infection rates rose and fell.", "For instance, Eastern District of Texas Judge Rodney Gilstrap suspended all jury trials due to rising COVID-19 infection rates in his district—and after a nearby trial before another judge ended in a mistrial after many of the participants contracted the disease.", "In that decision, Judge Gilstrap expressed a deep skepticism that jury trials, unlike other litigation procedures, could be conducted fairly in virtual form—remarking that in his view, online proceedings placed too much of a barrier between participants.", "However, he has since resumed in-person trials, starting with one between Solas OLED Limited and Samsung that kicked off in March.", "Judge Albright, meanwhile, held his second patent trial since taking the bench starting in late February, a closely watched in-person proceeding between Fortress Investment Group LLC subsidiary VLSI Technology LLC and Intel.", "That trial had previously been delayed several times as a result of COVID-19, with Judge Albright initially opting to move the trial to another division in order to work around a pandemic-related courthouse closure—a decision that resulted in two trips to the Federal Circuit.", "After one final delay due to winter storms, the trial went ahead with a variety of safety proceedings in place, including a daily COVID-19 testing requirement for attorneys that Judge Albright has since suspended for his next trial.", "In contrast, District Judge Thomas S. Zilly of the Western District of Washington has stood out for his recent decision to hold the nation’s first patent jury trial over Zoom, after his district worked closely with litigants to develop practical and equitable virtual trial procedures.", "Those included measures taken to ensure that the court could obtain a representative jury pool that was not generationally biased, nor skewed toward jurors wealthy enough to afford the equipment needed to participate virtually, in part by offering training and computer equipment to willing jurors.", "The court also worked with litigants to develop an effective process for conducting trials virtually, testing that process by conducting a mock trial with counsel from an actual, pending case and a paid jury pool.", "Despite the uncertainty over trial formats and procedures caused by the pandemic, Q1 2021 has continued a trend of high-dollar, high-profile jury verdicts in patent cases—including those resulting from the Solas OLED and VLSI Technology trials mentioned above, both of which resulted in significant damage awards, as well as a March infringement verdict from another trial in litigation filed by Personalized Media Communications, LLC.", "Such verdicts in these and other cases, issued in trials spanning the past 16 months, have capped off trials in other NPE campaigns as well as university litigation and operating company disputes, and involve products spanning market sectors including E-Commerce and Software, Financial Services, Mobile Devices and Communications, and Networking.", "See RPX Insight for an overview of notable verdicts handed down last year, as well as courts’ posttrial handling of other large damage awards issued before 2020.", "Market Sector Update: NPE Litigation Targeting Financial Services Skyrockets in Q1", "A breakdown of NPE district court filing trends by market sector (comparing the number of defendants added in Q1 to the quarterly average for 2020) reveals a marked increase in litigation targeting certain industries in the first quarter.", "Specifically, NPE litigation focused on the Financial Services sector jumped by 111%, with filings also rising in sectors like Mobile Communications and Devices (by 28%) and Networking (by 18%).", "That first-quarter wave of Financial Services litigation included lawsuits from a variety of familiar NPEs—among them IP Edge, which began a mobile point-of-sale campaign in September 2020 through its affiliated NPE Kwality IP LLC, initially targeting online payment service providers.", "In February, fellow IP Edge NPE Xylon Licensing LLC rebooted the campaign with a fresh wave of litigation targeting financial institutions.", "Another monetization firm, Dynamic IP Deals, LLC (d/b/a DynaIP), launched its own Financial Services campaign in Q1 as well through subsidiary mCom IP, LLC, also hitting several financial institutions—here over their use of digital banking platforms, focusing in part on certain analytics and marketing features.", "One more NPE that joined the fray in the first quarter was Caselas, LLC, one of several entities controlled by prolific inventor Raymond Anthony Joao, which in late January sued a group of banks and credit unions over the provision of financial payment cards.", "Additionally, inventor-controlled NPE Proxense, LLC launched a new mobile payments campaign in March, with allegations calling out biometric authentication features in particular.", "Mobile payments are also at issue in the latest round of lawsuits from inventor William Grecia, filed in January and February—his latest pivot in a long-running campaign that has also encompassed streaming services and cloud storage.", "For more coverage of litigation hitting this sector, see RPX Insight.", "Also, Financial Services is not the only space to see a sizeable uptick in recent NPE activity, as the Automotive sector experienced an even greater increase last year, despite the dip seen in Q1 2021.", "In 2020, NPE litigation targeting the Automotive sector rose by 120% compared to 2019, and with new entrants flocking to the scene, historically aggressive plaintiffs active in the space, and cars becoming increasingly high-tech, sustained activity in the sector looks likely.", "The effects will be felt by a broad range of defendants, from car makers and their suppliers to tech companies and wireless technology providers.", "See RPX’s fourth-quarter review for a deep dive on notable Automotive litigation filed by NPEs in Q4 and 2020 as a whole.", "PTAB Update: As NHK-Fintiv Limits IPR’s Availability, Defendants Reconsider Reexaminations", "In the first quarter of 2021, 337 petitions for America Invents Act (AIA) review were filed with the Patent Trial and Appeal Board (PTAB), including 304 petitions for inter partes review (IPR) and 33 petitions for post-grant review (PGR).", "This is comparable to the number of petitions filed in Q1 2020 (341). As previously reported by RPX, PTAB petitions for 2020 as a whole were up by 16.5% compared to 2019.", "However, AIA review institution rates have been on the decline. The institution rate in Q1 2021 was 58%, compared to 58.9% for the whole of 2020—which, in turn, was 2.2% lower than in 2019, when 61% of petitions were instituted.", "One of the most noteworthy factors contributing to this downturn is the PTAB’s increased exercise of discretion to deny institution in AIA review trials for reasons other than the merits, based on circumstances laid out in a steadily expanding body of precedential decisions.", "The most impactful of these has been the NHK-Fintiv rule, a set of factors established by the PTAB that allow it to consider the status of parallel district court litigation in deciding whether to institute.", "Perhaps most controversial of these factors has been one that allows the Board to deny institution when a parallel district court trial has been scheduled in close proximity to the deadline of the Board’s final decision.", "When litigating in venues that are more aggressive about scheduling early trial dates, such as the Western District of Texas, this factor shrinks the window in which an AIA review petition can be effectively filed to one smaller than what is practically allowed by statute.", "In the first quarter, the Federal Circuit made it much harder for such defendants to appeal the denial of an AIA review petition due to NHK-Fintiv.", "On March 13, the appellate court ruled in Mylan Laboratories v. Janssen Pharmaceutica that petitioner-defendants cannot directly appeal such a decision, and that they may only challenge one through a mandamus petition—further holding that such petitions must raise “colorable constitutional claims”, a high bar to clear.", "As the NHK-Fintiv rule makes AIA reviews a less attractive option, it is perhaps no surprise that some defendants seeking to challenge validity have increasingly been turning to ex parte reexaminations, which are not subject to discretionary denials.", "Indeed, in some cases, reexaminations have allowed companies to work around NHK-Fintiv denials and win stays in parallel district court litigation when IPR petitions have failed.", "Notably, this includes two recent rulings by District Judge Rodney Gilstrap of the Eastern District of Texas, one of which stayed litigation filed by NPE AGIS Software Development LLC and another that did the same in a case brought by Ramot at Tel Aviv University Limited.", "Beyond those strategic advantages resulting from NHK-Fintiv, reexaminations also offer other relative benefits, including that they tend to be much less expensive and the lack of estoppel—which for IPRs, bars companies from asserting in district court an invalidity argument that they “raised or reasonably could have raised” before the PTAB.", "That said, there are also significant disadvantages compared to IPR: in part, a third party requesting reexamination is essentially shut out from the process after the USPTO grants its request, and thus will not have the opportunity to rebut arguments subsequently raised by the patent owner.", "Meanwhile, the debate continues over NHK-Fintiv on both sides of the issue, including through litigation that spread to a new forum in Q1.", "Last year, Apple, Cisco, Google, and Intel sued then-USPTO Director Andrei Iancu in the Northern District of California, seeking to side aside the NHK-Fintiv rule—arguing that the rule conflicts with the AIA and is undermining the IPR regime.", "A growing coalition of companies spanning a wide range of industries aligned themselves with the California plaintiffs in Q1, including a group of 17 companies and industry associations operating in market sectors such as Automotive, Mobile Communications and Devices, Networking, and Semiconductors that recently filed a brief in support.", "Also, in February, the plaintiffs beat back a motion to intervene from a coalition of entities supporting the rule; those would-be intervenors, including inventors’ industry association US Inventor, have since filed suit against acting USPTO Director Andrew Hirshfeld in the Eastern District of Texas, seeking to halt all AIA reviews until the rule gets formally codified.", "The Supreme Court Considers APJ Appointments in Arthrex", "The first quarter also saw a key constitutional question proceed before the US Supreme Court in the ongoing appeal of Arthrex, in which the Court will decide whether the appointment of the PTAB’s administrative patent judges (APJs) violated the US Constitution’s Appointments Clause.", "In Arthrex, the Federal Circuit held in October 2019 that APJs were unconstitutionally appointed, concluding that under the applicable statute they were “principal officers” requiring Senate confirmation.", "However, rather than eliminate the PTAB altogether, the Federal Circuit chose a more targeted solution to the constitutionality issue by severing a portion of the statute restricting the Director’s removal authority over APJs, seeking to render them inferior officers.", "Both the Appointments Clause question and the proper remedy, should the Supreme Court agree that the current regime is unconstitutional, remain at issue—and were both addressed by the Court during oral arguments, which were held on March 1 and revealed no clear consensus among the Justices.", "Section 101 Update: Congress Renews Its Focus on Patent Eligibility Reform", "As frequently reported by RPX, the Supreme Court’s Alice decision remains in a narrowed state since the Federal Circuit’s 2018 Berkheimer and Aatrix decisions, which limited early patent eligibility rulings.", "While Alice invalidation rates have become markedly lower as a result, Section 101 has seen renewed attention from Congress in the past quarter.", "The following analysis reviews the latest data and takes a deep dive on those recent policy developments.", "The overall invalidation rate currently stands at 57% for patents adjudicated under Alice since the decision’s June 2014 issuance and through Q1 2021.", "A breakdown by plaintiff type, as shown below, reveals that NPEs and operating companies fare differently under Alice: challenges against patents asserted by NPEs prevail 64% of the time, whereas patents litigated by operating companies get invalidated under Alice 48% of the time.", "The effect of Berkheimer is also evident at a high level, as the overall invalidation rate since that decision’s February 2018 issuance has been 45%, compared to 65% before.", "Limiting the data to decisions that turned on Berkheimer or Aatrix, meaning that a plaintiff asserted that a factual issue precluded early resolution and the court’s order actually addressed that issue, further shows how the impact of Berkheimer varies by procedural stage.", "This analysis shows that courts found sufficient facts to rule about half of the time for Rule 12, compared to 23% for summary judgment.", "Furthermore, adding a plaintiff type filter to that analysis, as shown below, illustrates again how plaintiff type affects outcome.", "In particular, NPEs succeed less often at blocking Rule 12 challenges under Berkheimer/Aatrix, with courts finding sufficient facts to issue a ruling 57% of the time for motions against NPEs but 40% of the time for those against operating companies.", "NPEs fare even worse at the summary judgment stage, as courts found sufficient facts to rule in 75% of Alice summary judgment motions against NPEs—whereas for summary judgment motions against operating companies, courts found sufficient facts just 4% of the time.", "Additionally, the top five most popular districts for NPE litigation diverge sharply in their treatment of Alice motions, as shown below.", "Of those five, the Northern District of California is the most likely to grant an Alice challenge, with a per-patent invalidation rate of 70%.", "The District of Delaware and the Central District of California, each of which has an invalidation rate of 52%, are the closest to the national average of 57%.", "The Western District of Texas has the lowest invalidation rate of the group at just 25%, though it should be noted that just 21 patents appear to have been adjudicated in that venue under Alice since it was decided in June 2014.", "This small number of reviewed patents, and their low invalidation rate, are at least partly attributable to two factors: the district’s relatively recent rise in the rankings as a patent venue, and Judge Albright’s stated inclination against granting early patent eligibility motions.", "Moreover, a breakdown of invalidation rates by market sector (specifically, by the RPX market sector assigned to the litigation in which the patents were asserted and then challenged under Alice) reveals that parties filing Alice motions prevail far more often in litigation targeting certain industries.", "Subject matter eligibility challenges succeed most often against patents asserted in Financial Services suits, in which 79% of asserted patents adjudicated under Alice have had all challenged claims invalidated; followed by Automotive (72%), Biotech and Pharma (70%), and Semiconductors (69%).", "Sectors with the lowest invalidation rates include Medical (33%), Networking (38%), and Industrial (45%).", "One of the most persistent criticisms of Alice is the difficulty that courts face in applying the decision consistently.", "Among the most frequent critics of this uneven jurisprudence has been Senator Thom Tillis (R-NC), the former chair and current ranking member of the Senate IP Subcommittee, who has argued persistently in favor of legislative reform but hit a wall in 2019 after stakeholders in the life sciences and tech industries failed to reach a consensus.", "While Senator Tillis has since continued to speak out on this issue, the first quarter brought signs that he and some of his colleagues are gearing up for a new run at reform.", "On March 5, Senator Tillis and three other members of the IP Subcommittee—Senators Tom Cotton (R-AR), Christopher Coons (D-DE), and Mazie Hirono (D-HI)—sent a letter to Acting USPTO Director Drew Hirshfeld, stating that it was “past time that Congress act to address this issue” and asking for his assistance as they “consider what legislative action should be taken to reform our eligibility laws”.", "To that end, the senators asked that Hirshfeld “publish a request for information on the current state of patent eligibility jurisprudence in the United States, evaluate the responses, and provide [them] with a detailed summary of [his] findings”—with emphasis on current caselaw’s adverse impact on “investment and innovation in critical technologies like quantum computing, artificial intelligence, precision medicine, diagnostic methods, and pharmaceutical treatments”.", "Weeks later, Senators Tillis and Cotton sent Hirshfeld another letter asking him to consider revising the patent examination process to conduct the Section 101 inquiry last, rather than in conjunction with Sections 102, 103, and 112.", "The senators expressed a concern that under the current system, “patent examiners may be issuing Section 101 rejections without the benefit of addressing prior art, clarity and enablement issues that may well inform the examiner that the claim is eligible under Section 101”.", "Hirshfeld has since indicated that an official response to the letter is forthcoming, stating that the USPTO is considering a pilot program “to that effect”.", "In March, Senator Tillis also took the unusual step of cofiling an amicus brief with former Federal Circuit Judge Paul Michel and former USPTO Director David Kappos in American Axle & Manufacturing v. Neapco, a patent eligibility case presently before the Supreme Court that has ignited a heated debate over the bounds of Section 101 jurisprudence.", "In American Axle, a divided Federal Circuit found that a patent related to a quieter automotive driveshaft was unpatentably directed to a natural law, Hooke’s Law, in contrast to decisions like Diamond v. Diehr that found a mechanical process implementing a natural law to be eligible.", "The full Federal Circuit was split 6-6 on whether to rehear the panel decision—falling short of the threshold for en banc review.", "Several other amicus briefs have also been filed in that case from a range of other stakeholders, including others from the academic community, business trade associations, and the NYIPLA.", "When asked about his amicus brief in a recent interview, Senator Tillis underscored that while he has not yet given up on the prospect of legislative reform, it is both the hardest path forward and the slowest—emphasizing that the quickest way forward is for the Supreme Court to take on the issue itself.", "FRAND Update: Caselaw Moves Further in a Direction Favoring SEP Owners", "The first quarter also saw global FRAND jurisprudence move further in favor of patent owners—including a new German decision imposing heightened requirements on accused infringers, and a US ruling limiting SEP antitrust liability that a government agency recently declined to appeal.", "On February 22, the German Federal Court of Justice issued its decision in Sisvel v. Haier II (“Sisvel II”), which built upon its July 2020 ruling in Sisvel v. Haier I (“Sisvel I”)—a landmark opinion that established a series of guidelines for the conduct expected of SEP owners and implementers in FRAND disputes.", "That earlier decision in part set a higher bar for accused infringers hoping to show that their prior licensing behavior had been FRAND-compliant, with the court explaining that defendants must go well beyond merely stating their willingness to take a FRAND license.", "The court clarified and expanded upon these guidelines in Sisvel II. In part, it held that a SEP owner does not abuse its market power by submitting an initial offer that was not FRAND, explaining that such an opening offer is not the end goal but the start of a negotiation, and that it is not always clear in a complex dispute what constitutes a FRAND license.", "Rather, it is up to both parties to arrive at a FRAND agreement through good-faith negotiations.", "In explaining the obligations for both sides in such a negotiation, the court set an even higher bar than in Sisvel I for implementers hoping to show that a SEP owner’s conduct had been abusive under competition law: to do so, the implementer must show that it was “clearly and unambiguously” willing to take a FRAND license throughout the negotiation process, and that it maintained such willingness consistently and continuously during that process.", "Nearly all of the SEP owner’s obligations are conditioned upon such implementer behavior, the court held, apart from its duty to provide notice of infringement.", "Moreover, the court held that implementer hold-out (strategic delay in taking a license) can be deemed “dishonest conduct” and characterized it as involving the exploitation of a patent owner’s inherent “structural disadvantage” (i.e., the need to license patents to economically benefit from them).", "Also disfavoring implementers was the court’s ruling limiting when they may rely on a patent ambush defense, which arises when a member of a standard-setting organization intentionally conceals information about patents relevant to a standard.", "Crucially, the court held that under German law, such a defense may not be asserted against subsequent assignees of a patent and is limited to claims against the original patentee—thus precluding the defense’s use for patents subsequently acquired by NPEs.", "On the domestic front, one of the most significant US developments in SEP jurisprudence came in March, when the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) opted not to appeal the Ninth Circuit’s August 2020 decision in FTC v. Qualcomm to the US Supreme Court.", "In that case, the Ninth Circuit reversed the Northern District of California’s May 2019 ruling that Qualcomm had violated antitrust law by requiring mobile device makers to take licenses to its patents before they could buy its cellular modem chips—holding instead that Qualcomm’s conduct did not amount to a violation of antitrust law, and that such disputes over SEP licensing are best resolved under contract law.", "That August ruling was one of a series of victories for the US Department of Justice’s Antitrust Division, led at the time by Assistant Attorney General Makan Delrahim.", "Under Delrahim, the Antitrust Division reassessed its posture toward antitrust enforcement in SEP disputes, arguing that such disagreements should be handled under contract law, not antitrust; placing more emphasis on implementer hold-out rather than patent owner hold-up (the assertion of a SEP to gain an unduly high license rate); and favoring the availability of injunctive relief in SEP disputes (a remedy previously deemed anticompetitive in this context).", "The division advocated for these policies through a variety of channels, including the filing of amicus briefs in cases with SEP antitrust claims that courts ultimately found persuasive—including FTC v. Qualcomm as well as another FRAND dispute dealing with SEP licensing, Continental v. Avanci et al., which the court also dismissed under a similar contract law theory.", "The FTC’s case against Qualcomm, brought during the Obama administration but pursued during the Trump years, put the Commission squarely at odds with the Delrahim’s Antitrust Division.", "It remains to be seen whether the Biden administration will choose a new direction, but in the meantime, the FTC has doubled down on its prior posture.", "In a statement announcing the FTC’s decision not to appeal the Qualcomm case, Acting Chairwoman Rebecca Kelly Slaughter cited the “significant headwinds facing the commission in this matter”, perhaps acknowledging the magnitude of the above changes in the SEP landscape, but pushed again for SEP antitrust enforcement: “Now more than ever, the FTC and other law enforcement agencies need to boldly enforce the antitrust laws to guard against abusive behavior by dominant firms, including in high-technology markets and those that involve intellectual property.”", "Slaughter further underscored that she is “particularly concerned about the potential for anticompetitive or unfair behavior in the context of standard setting”, stating that “the FTC will closely monitor conduct in this arena”.", "Marketplace Update: Operating Company Patents and Outside Funding Still Fueling NPE Litigation", "RPX data on the origins of asserted patents show that the vast majority of patent litigation has consistently involved patents originating with operating companies.", "This trend includes NPE litigation and persisted into Q1: as shown below, the data reveal that NPEs far more often assert patents originating with operating companies (shown below in light blue) than homegrown NPE assets (shown in orange).", "Combined with litigation filed by operating companies (in dark blue), which comprises about 30-40% of defendants added in recent years, about 85% of the patent litigation filed in any given year from 2005 onward has involved at least some operating company patents.", "The flow of operating company patents to NPEs may accelerate as a result of COVID-19. Per prior RPX coverage, if past is precedent, the financial crisis triggered by the pandemic may well be followed by years of increased patent divestments by operating companies as those patent owners face pressure to preserve and augment balance sheet cash, with some of those assets ending up in NPE hands.", "One result of that activity could very well be a further rise in NPE litigation.", "Indeed, such transactions continue to fuel NPE activity today, with some divestments sparking new litigation campaigns in the first quarter of 2021.", "Take for example the portfolio of nearly 30 patents, mostly focused on network security, that Pennsylvania-based CyberSoft, Inc. assigned in early February to NPE Cybersoft IP LLC, a subsidiary of patent monetization firm Dynamic IP Deals, LLC (d/b/a DynaIP).", "Cybersoft IP has since launched its inaugural campaign, targeting network security software products in a pair of lawsuits filed against BlackBerry and FireEye.", "That plaintiff is among a trio of Texas-based NPEs formed by DynaIP in late 2020, another one of which—AML IP LLC—has continued to file new cases in the e-commerce campaign it began just before the start of the new year.", "Meanwhile, in early March, 2BCom, LLC, an NPE that has targeted automakers as well as networking companies with litigation over former Toshiba patents, received yet more patents from the Japanese conglomerate.", "That assignment, which includes patents related to wireless communications, could signal a plan to “refresh” a campaign that saw a string of dismissals in late 2020.", "Also during the first quarter of 2021, Scramoge Technology Limited—an Irish NPE linked by public records to the hedge fund Magnetar Capital, as detailed further below—received over 120 US patent assets from LG Innotek, including assets related to wireless charging and NFC communications.", "A number of operating company-to-NPE divestments executed in Q1 include patents related to semiconductors.", "In late February, California-based fabless chipmaker NEWRACOM—formed in 2014 by a group of over 20 individuals from the Electronics and Telecommunications Research Institute (ETRI)—assigned hundreds of homegrown US patent assets, as well as a number of counterparts in Asia and Europe, to Atlas Global Technologies LLC, a subsidiary of Acacia Research Corporation.", "Additionally, IPValue Management (d/b/a IPValue) subsidiary Future Link Systems, LLC acquired another set of patents from NXP Semiconductors in mid-January, after filing its first litigation in late 2020 over patents from the same source.", "Also notable are two late-December assignments, recently made public by the USPTO, from Teleputers, LLC to Coresecure Technologies, LLC, two NPEs apparently controlled by the same Princeton professor.", "While Coresecure has not yet filed any litigation, Teleputers kicked off a semiconductor campaign of its own in June 2020.", "Since 2019, RPX has reported on the practices of a new breed of NPEs—one with sufficient resources to acquire relatively robust portfolios of patents for assertion in expensive, often multi-front, and potentially protracted enforcement campaigns.", "Now, with the litigation finance industry flush with capital amid the COVID-19 pandemic, and with a number of third-party backed campaigns maturing, the effects of litigation finance on the patent space are becoming apparent.", "Litigation funding is typically provided on a nonrecourse basis, with the funder collecting a return on its investment only in the event of a successful outcome.", "If a funded plaintiff fails to recover in litigation, that plaintiff is generally not obligated to repay the funds advanced for the litigation.", "Given that a nonrecourse funding arrangement comes with the risk of a total loss for the investor, litigation funders are spending substantial time and effort evaluating patents for assertion.", "As litigation finance continues to permeate the patent space, the character of the assets asserted by third-party funded NPEs may reflect additional due diligence and portfolio selection.", "Among the most notable campaigns with third-party backing are those being waged by a growing web of affiliated Irish NPEs backed by Magnetar Capital, a hedge fund with $12.3B in assets under management.", "The most established plaintiffs in that group include Data Scape Limited, litigating patents originating with Sony; Neodrón Limited, asserting patents received from Microchip or subsidiary Atmel; and Solas OLED Limited, waging a multi-front litigation campaign since April 2019 over display panels, including both district court litigation and actions brought before the International Trade Commission, and also with former Microchip patents.", "Amid a recent trial victory against Samsung, Solas OLED filed two new complaints against Samsung (including Samsung Display) during the first quarter.", "Moreover, another two related NPEs—Arigna Technology Limited and Sonraí Memory Limited—launched their first campaigns in February, wielding former HP Enterprise (HPE), Mitsubishi, or Microchip (Atmel) patents in suits targeting automakers and device makers.", "Meanwhile, as recently covered by RPX, USPTO records indicate that yet more well-funded Irish NPEs are waiting in the wings—some with former operating company portfolios already in hand.", "Another active NPE with outside backing is Fundamental Innovation Systems International LLC (FISI), which in March added two new cases to the USB charging campaign that it has been waging since 2016 over patents acquired from BlackBerry.", "FISI’s current management team is reportedly behind two other Irish NPEs holding significant portfolios of former operating company assets—Pictiva Display International Limited and Valtrus Innovations Limited—with USPTO records reflecting the recent movement of a large portfolio of patents from HPE to Ocean Tomo (OT Patent Escrow LLC) to Valtrus Innovations.", "More well-funded litigation from this team, again over former operating company patents, looks headed for the courts in 2021.", "For further analysis and up-to-date information on patent litigation and market trends, visit RPX Insight."]}

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. This was a highly successful quarter for InterDigital with revenue growing by 64% year-over-year to more than $140 million, driven by an excellent blend of strong reocurring revenues and royalty payments for past sales.", "Our performance was fueled by licensing deals signed with several major device manufacturers, including a mobile license with Xiaomi and a consumer electronic license with one of the top 10 global TV manufacturers.", "I will let Rich give you more details on the numbers. But I want to emphasize that this kind of result is only made possible when the business is closely aligned with our strategic goals and when we execute superbly across the company on our key initiatives.", "Since the beginning of 2020, we have signed 16 new agreements, including 10 so far in 2021. It's worth remembering that most of these deals have been signed during the COVID pandemic, when meetings with prospective licensees have taken place virtually.", "This is a remarkable achievement and demonstrates the adaptivity, the expertise and the tenacity of our whole team.", "Additionally, our use of video conferencing in these negotiations highlights the importance of the connectivity and video technologies we have created.", "During the third quarter, we closed our new license with Xiaomi, which has risen to become one of the top three smartphone manufacturers in the world in 2021.", "This agreement provides consistent, substantial, reoccurring revenue for years to come, and underscores the value of our cellular portfolio, particularly in 5G as well as the importance of our patent coverage in video and Wi-Fi.", "In addition to the Xiaomi deal, we also signed a new license agreement with a top 10 global TV manufacturer and renewed our license agreement with Seiko.", "Together, this agreement underlines both the quality and the breadth of our research and our patent portfolio.", "It also points to our excellent recent progress, including deals in the CE sector.", "Our performance highlights the strong momentum we continue to build and cements our status as the leading innovator in mobile and video technologies.", "With increasing adoption of IoT and video services, our technology has never been more important. However, there are still major manufacturers that continue to benefit from the innovation InterDigital has created but have yet to pay a licensing fee like many of the peers.", "We remain actively engaged on multiple fronts with those manufacturers. And while we would prefer to reach agreement via commercial negotiations, we are prepared to enforce our IP rights when necessary should we be unable to come to an agreement with them.", "Our groundbreaking research is the foundation of everything we do, and our R and I engineers are consistently recognized for the quality of the research and their leadership of the industry.", "Recently, one of our senior engineers was appointed as the chair of a key working group with European Telecommunications Standards Institute, which is working on technology that could dramatically improve the use case for wireless connectivity.", "On the video side, the Head of our Regional Standard Team has been given the highest technical honor by the Advanced Television Standards Committee for his years of working on the cutting edge of video technology.", "Our work in Wi-Fi has also received further recognition with our research team being commended for their contributions in power-saving technology which significantly extend battery life and also in high-frequency Wi-Fi, which dramatically increases network speeds.", "While we are always delighted to see InterDigital engineers receive well-deserved industry accolades, a highlight of research is how our R and I team contributes across the board to our world-class patent portfolio.", "More than 90% of our engineers are inventors and almost 60% of our inventors have at least 10 patents.", "Despite of the impact of pandemic, we remain focused on developing key wireless and video technologies and are on pace to grow our contribution to the 5G standard by well over 50% year-over-year and the number of 5G invention disclosures by more than 30% year-over-year.", "In short, we believe our 5G story has never been more competitive. At InterDigital, we pride ourselves in being at the forefront of development of the next generation of innovation in connectivity, which is why I'm particularly pleased with some of the work we are doing in the early stages of 6G. For example, we are a founding member of the University of Texas at Austin 6G Research Center, along with fellow founders, AT and T, NVIDIA, Qualcomm and Samsung.", "We will work with the University in areas that will form the core of 6G such as AI and machine learning, advances in technologies and more.", "In September, we also cohosted the 6GSymposium Fall, a two-day virtual event that we held in partnership with Northeastern University and the Next G Alliance.", "The event attracted over 2,000 participants and brought together over 60 speakers from industry, garment academia and beyond to discuss some of the priorities, opportunities and challenges for 6G. On the litigation front, our new license agreement with Xiaomi means all pending cases between the parties will cease.", "We still have ongoing proceedings with Lenovo in the U.K., U.S. and China.", "In August, we won a complete victory from the U.K. High Court in our first technical trial, which found our patent in suit to be valid, essential to 4G LTE standard and infringed by Lenovo.", "We are now preparing for our FRAND trial in U.K. which will take place in January of 2022 and will determine the terms that will be applicable to a worldwide license with Lenovo.", "Moving on to some internal changes at the company. As we first announced in June, we have taken steps in 2021 to restructure our research and innovation group with a focus in France.", "We recently expanded that effort to look at total cost structure of our G and A functions, largely centered in the U.S., which will result in significant annual cost savings beginning in 2022.", "Additionally, as we announced two weeks ago, we appointed Josh Schmidt as our new Chief Legal Officer and Corporate Secretary.", "Josh was previously Deputy General Counsel at InterDigital where he managed a wide range of matters, including public company reporting, corporate governance, M and A, employment, R and D collaboration agreements and our ESG initiatives.", "After six years with InterDigital, he has in-depth understanding of the company and is a superb addition to our executive leadership team.", "Josh is taking over from Rick Gulino who is retiring after several years of excellent service as our Chief Legal Officer.", "Rick has agreed to stay on board as a strategic advisor until December to ensure a smooth transition, and I'd like to thank Rick for his contribution to InterDigital and to wish him well for his retirement.", "And with that, I will let Rich provide you with more details on our third quarter business performance.", "Richard J. Brezski -- Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer", "Thanks, Liren. I'm really pleased to provide details on what has been our strongest quarter in almost four years.", "With increased adoption of both the 5G cellular standard and HEVC video standard, the combination of our wireless and video technologies has never been more important.", "This is evident in our strong financial results, headlined by $144 million of revenue, including $93 million of recurring revenue.", "Both the increase in recurring revenue and the past sales were driven by new license agreements, including Xiaomi on the mobile side, and with a top 10 global TV manufacturer on the CE side.", "Xiaomi is the third major smartphone manufacturer who has taken a license to our wireless and video technologies in the last two years.", "Led by our 5G wireless and HEVC video technologies, the aggregate value of these three contracts is expected to be more than $0.5 billion.", "We now have roughly 55% of the smartphone market under license and expect to be paid on about 800 million smartphones shipped during this year.", "Given the increased concentration within the market, we believe we have an opportunity to increase our license market share to about 80% by adding a few customers.", "At the same time, we are increasing our penetration in CE markets where the latest licenses have raised our recurring revenue to roughly $20 million on an annualized basis.", "Given our substantial operating leverage, the 64% increase in total revenue we reported led to a 138% increase in operating income.", "This occurred despite reporting onetime expenses of $26 million. The remaining sequential increase in operating expense was driven by a $3 million increase in litigation costs as we move toward our scheduled January 2022 FRAND trial with Lenovo.", "Even including the onetime expenses, we reported GAAP EPS of $0.83 per share, which was our best quarterly mark since first quarter 2018.", "Moving on to cash. We reported $87 million of free cash flow in the quarter, driving our quarter end cash balance to $900 million.", "We also reported that our year-to-date share repurchases have reached approximately $30 million as of November 3.", "Looking forward to Q4, we expect total revenue to be in the range of $98 million to -- excuse me, $105 million, including an expected increase in recurring revenue to $97 million to $100 million.", "As always, these figures do not include any new agreements we might sign over the balance of the quarter.", "As for fourth quarter expenses, Liren already noted, we expanded our restructuring program early in Q4.", "We now expect to recognize another $5 million to $6 million of related restructuring expenses in the fourth quarter, on top of our recurring expense base of just over $80 million from the third quarter.", "We believe these actions will better position us for growth by providing the space to make additional investments to further expand our leadership in key areas while driving higher profit margins and better returns to our shareholders.", "We will provide additional updates on the long-term net savings from these actions as we evaluate our levels of reinvestment in connection with developing our 2022 plan.", "Thank you, Rich. Thank you, Liren. And we will now open the call for questions.", "[Operator Instructions] And we'll take our first question from Ian Zaffino with Oppenheimer.", "Just wanted to get a little detail on what's going on, on the smaller video players? I know you talked about doing some patent pools.", "What's the progress there? And help us understand how that's going to proceed?", "Richard J. Brezski -- Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer", "Ian, we missed the beginning of your question. I think you were asking what the status is with smaller video players and how we plan to proceed there individual licensing versus pools?", "Yes, because you talked about it somewhere in the video there. Yes. So I wanted maybe to go down to the next tier and get a little color on that.", "Richard J. Brezski -- Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer", "Yes. So Ian, we announced -- I think Liren mentioned in his script, the number of licenses we've signed over the last year which was quite a few, particularly if you compare that to historical patterns.", "And part of that is by making progress with some of the smaller video players. Of course, the big news for the quarter is on the video side is signing a top 10 global TV manufacturer.", "That's the most significant CE deals that we've signed since closing the Technicolor acquisition. But of course, that's still -- that acquisition still plays into the Xiaomi deal, which, as I mentioned, includes HEVC technology.", "And our next question comes from Derek Soderberg with Colliers Securities.", "Hey guys! Congrats on the very strong results. And congrats to you, Rich, on the retirement. On the commentary that you guys put could potentially license 80% of the handset market.", "Wondering what the time line you envision for potentially getting to that 80% number? What sort of needs to happen as well?", "And can you guys benefit as you see that concentration sort of go up from the key players in the industry?", "Or sort of, do you need to wait until those existing deals that you have with those guys -- you have to wait until you resign those deals?", "Liren Chen -- President and Chief Executive Officer", "Derek, this is Liren. Yes, regarding the 80% market concentration question, we do see we can get to that number by simply signing another few vendors that has significant market share.", "And regarding the exact timing of the signing of those agreements, each individual discussion has its own sort of discussion dynamic.", "As we described earlier, we always prefer commercial negotiations and most of our deals do get done through commercial negotiations.", "However, we have to enforce our right, as our track record as indicated. We are able to successfully enforce a right, which every single time leads to a license agreement that supports our valuation.", "So regarding the key player market increase. Of the agreement that has already in place, a vast majority of our agreements are $6 amount agreement.", "So in that context, we got a substantial reoccurring, but it is the same payment throughout the course of the agreement.", "And we do have some variable agreements, but they are a smaller portion of licensing program. However, as you have pointed out here, our agreements, they all have certain terms.", "So when the agreement expires when we do negotiate with them for the next agreement, the increased volume as well as future projections are some of the key indicators that we will consider.", "Got it. That's helpful. And then on noncurrent royalties came in higher. It looks like due to that TV agreement.", "I think that brought in close to $21 million. That seems a bit atypical for a consumer electronics agreement.", "Could you provide any additional color as to why that was the case this time?", "Richard J. Brezski -- Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer", "Yes. I think what I'll just say there is there was a period of infringement prior to signing the agreement.", "So that was the result of covering some of that prior infringement.", "Got it. Got it. And then just another quick one on recurring revenue. It looks like that TV deal contributed $1.5 million to $2 million this quarter, but guidance sort of implies a decent step-up.", "Just curious if you can sort of parse out the upside in recurring revenue guidance as it relates to new deals, timing of some of the -- you guys receiving a revenue, tech solutions?", "Any color on that sequential growth in recurring revenue would be helpful.", "Richard J. Brezski -- Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer", "Yes, sure. So I guess the first thing I'd say relative to the TV deal, we had been reporting roughly $15 million annualized recurring revenue in CE.", "And now I've kind of talked about that CE recurring revenue being $20 million on an annualized basis.", "I'll note that, that does move around a little bit more than the mobile side because there's a greater proportion, a much greater proportion of variable deals on CE.", "So that's going to really move up and down based on shipments in a given quarter. Where on the mobile side, we have, particularly on a dollar-weighted basis, much more revenue coming from fixed price agreements, which are going to be generally the same quarter after quarter.", "That $5 million increase, if you think about it, if you just take 1.5 annualized, that's about $6 million.", "So that's kind of in that zone. And again, we don't want to be overly precise because of the variability quarter-to-quarter.", "So hopefully, that addresses the question. If there was another aspect I missed, Derek, please let me know.", "Richard J. Brezski -- Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer", "Okay. And then let me just clarify, Derek, there's a plethora of Richards that I got. In addition to myself, we have Richard Lloyd here today.", "It was Rick Gulino, our Chief Legal Officer, that had retired so.", "Richard J. Brezski -- Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer", "And our next question comes from Scott Searle with ROTH Capital.", "Just to follow up on the prior question. In terms of the TV relationship that was signed. I want to make sure that there was a recurring element to that, that was recognized in the quarter.", "Also wondering kind of what the pipeline looks like that in the near term. And if there was any IoT contribution during the quarter, if that's starting to ramp up and where that stands?", "Richard J. Brezski -- Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer", "Yes. So Scott, there was a recurring element to the TV deal signed during the quarter. So I'll start with that.", "And as to IoT, there continues to be revenue recognition from -- contributions from the Avanci platform.", "I don't think there's anything material to call out in terms of a change there. But certainly, we'll keep you updated as that does evolve.", "Great. And I'm wondering if you could give a quick update in terms of the relationship and discussions with LG in terms of their potential exit from the handset market and sell that business.", "What that means for any sort of potential licensee opportunities going forward. Is there any update on that front?", "Liren Chen -- President and Chief Executive Officer", "Scott, this is Liren. So as you pointed out, LG has decided to exit the smartphone licensing program.", "So as a result, the mobile licensing program no longer in place. So LG is a very significant player in TV market.", "So as we are expanding the CE market, consumer electronic market, we are engaging in active discussions regarding getting paid on the CE side.", "I don't have more precise as to report other than we are having active engagement with them.", "Okay. And lastly, if I could, Liren. Now that you've been in for a bid, you guys are certainly generating significant amount of cash flow.", "You start to return some of that to the shareholders in terms of buybacks and otherwise. But I'm wondering how you're starting to think about inorganic opportunities.", "Are you actively looking on that front? Or do you have enough on your plate in terms of executing with unlicensed mobile providers as well as the video opportunity?", "Liren Chen -- President and Chief Executive Officer", "Yes. So regarding -- yes, we do have a substantial amount of cash on our balance sheet, which is I consider a very strong strength for the company.", "And we have a very strong team, super strong patent portfolio and a very impactful track record enforcing our right when we have to.", "We are always looking at new opportunities. So if there's a right opportunity coming and that makes sense for us to consider merger acquisition, we will.", "But internally, we are very, very strong. Regarding the on-license opportunities that you are pointing out to here, as I mentioned earlier, we always prefer commercial negotiation, and we are having negotiations with multiple vendors on multiple fronts.", "And as I mentioned also earlier, we are ready to enforce our right if necessary. And we have a very good track record in that space also.", "[Operator Instructions] We'll take our next question from Joseph Kowalsky with Upstream Investment Partners.", "Joseph Kowalsky -- Upstream Investment Partners -- Analyst", "Good morning. Congrats on a great quarter and a great beginning to the new management team. I've been a shareholder since the early 1980, and I have about 100 clients for our shareholders as well.", "And you really answered my questions, but I did want to make two brief comments. Bill Merritt was a great litigator.", "But I think it showed in his management style, and I'm really happy to see indications that the new management has a more collaborative approach, and I appreciate that very much.", "The other comment is that InterDigital was known for years for its good relations with its shareholders who acted frequently as a free public relations resource.", "And at some point in the not too distant past, there seems to be more of a circling of the wagon. And I'm grateful to see that the company is working to renew good relations with the shareholders that I think could again be a very good resource for the company.", "And an example being simply taking questions and comments on this call. And it really -- it encourages me, and I think that the entire movement of the company in the last several months has been just in the absolute right direction.", "I really want to just thank you very much for all of that.", "Richard J. Brezski -- Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer", "Liren Chen -- President and Chief Executive Officer", "Joseph, this is Liren. I also appreciate your comments. I also want to thank you for being a long-term shareholder for InterDigital.", "And we collectively for the new management, definitely wanted to build on Bill's legacy, which he had built a very strong company and we're grateful what we have, and we obviously wanted to work with shareholders for the next level of success.", "[Operator Instructions] At this time, I'm showing no questions in queue. I would like to hand it back over to our speaker for any additional or closing remarks.", "Thank you, Amy. Liren, do you have any final remarks?", "Liren Chen -- President and Chief Executive Officer", "Yes. Thank you for everyone for joining us today. I'll close by saying thank you all to all the employees for your dedication and strong execution.", "I also hope everyone stays safe and healthy as we continue to navigate through the pandemic.", "Thanks, Liren.

million for the quarter, up from 190 in Q3 2020 and down from 320 in Q4 2019.", "- Buybacks remained top heavy, with the top 20 issues accounting for 66.3% of Q4 2020 buybacks, down from 77.4% in Q3 2020, 87.2% in Q2 2020, but still up from the historical pre-COVID average of 44.5%.", "- Full year 2020 buybacks were $519.7 billion, a 28.7% decrease from 2019's 728.7 billion, and 35.6% less than the record $806.4 billion in 2018.", "- Buybacks are expected to significantly increase in 2021, as big banks, via Fed approval for Q1 2021, have returned to the buyback market and more companies continue to look to negate stock options.", "- 6.4% of companies reduced share counts by at least 4% year-over-year, down from Q3 2020's 9.6%, and down significantly from Q4 2019's 20.7% (the recent

"\"More companies ventured back into the buyback market as they sought shares to cover employee options being exercised and prevent dilution.", "That, combined with buying from cash-flow strong companies, resulted in a buyback rebound in the fourth quarter,\" said Howard Silverblatt, Senior Index Analyst at S&P Dow Jones Indices.", "Silverblatt added, \"More companies are expected to venture back into the buyback market – initially to cover stock options, and then, depending on cash-flow, to reduce share count and increase earnings-per-share.", "Big-banks, which received Fed Q1 2021 approval to resume buybacks, are expected to significantly increase their 2020 expenditure of $80.7 billion, most of which – $46.6 billion – was done in the pre-COVID Q1 2020 period, subject to Fed approval.\"", "Information Technology continued to lead and dominate in buybacks, even as their share declined to 42.9% of all S&P 500 buybacks from Q3 2020's 48.9%, partially due to a higher buyback participation rate in the S&P 500.", "For the quarter, the sector spent $56.1 billion, up 12.8% from the prior quarter's $49.7 billion, and up 7.0% from the Q4 2019 $52.4 billion level.", "For 2020,

"For 2020, the group spent $80.7 billion, representing 15.5% of all buybacks, down 54.8% from their 2019 expenditure of $178.7 billion, which represented 24.5% of the buybacks.", "For 2021, big-banks are expected to return to the buyback market, and significantly increase their expenditures.", "Of note, Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway, spent $9.0 billion on buybacks in Q4, the same as it did in Q3, as it spent $24.7 billion for the year, compared to $4.9 billion in 2019.", "Health Care returned to spend $15.0 billion for the quarter, representing 11.5% of the buybacks, up 98.9% from their Q3 2020 $7.6 billion expenditure.", "For 2020, the sector spent $54.1 billion, representing 10.4% of the buybacks, down from the $83.9 billion spent in 2019, when it represented 11.5% of the buybacks.", "The five issues with the highest total buybacks for Q4 2020 are:", "- Apple (AAPL) continued to be the poster-child for buybacks, spending $27.6 billion in Q4 2020, setting a new record for any company in S&P 500 history, as the level was up from their Q3 2020 $17.6 billion expenditure and their Q4 2019 $22.1 billion level.", "For 2020, Apple has spent $81.5 billion on buybacks, down a tick from 2019's $81.7 billion.

billion for Q4 2020, the same level as Q3 2020; for 2020 they spent $24.7 billion versus $4.9 billion.", "- Alphabet (GOOG/L): $7.9 billion for Q4 2020, also the same as their Q3 2020 expenditure; for

billion.", "- Charter Communications (CHTR): $4.4 billion for Q4 20120, up from $3.4 billion in Q3 2020; for 2020 they spent $11.2 billion versus $6.9 billion.", "For more information about S&P Dow

Many in the field believe that this is a substantive interpretation of the law that requires more, and more public discussion and analysis prior to its application to rights holders in the everyday practice of their trade, particularly given the lack of evidence that “patent holdup” is a significant or pervasive problem.", "It was this very lack of evidence of anticompetitive effects in the Qualcomm case that led Commissioner Ohlhausen to issue a written dissent decrying the lack of facts or economic analysis to show that Qualcomm’s licensing practices led to the alleged anticompetitive harms in the marketplace.", "Her dissent recognizes the right of SEP holders to monetize their investments, stating that “reasonable royalties are not an exclusionary tax, even if paid by competitors.”", "But she does not dispute — at least not expressly — the complaint’s underlying premise that the holder of an SEP gives up its right to exclude others when it contributes its patent to the standard.", "Assuming that the Trump FTC continues to prosecute the Qualcomm case — which is far from a certainty — resolution of the case will provide key guidance on the appropriate treatment of SEPs under the antitrust laws and the FTC Act."]}

Ohlhausen dissented from the decision to file suit, criticizing the action as “based on a flawed legal theory ... that lacks economic and evidentiary support[.]”1", "The FTC contended that Qualcomm had violated federal antitrust law through several of its patent licensing policies.", "Qualcomm holds a significant portfolio of patents that are essential to practicing various cellular standards (standard-essential patents, or SEPs), as well as many nonessential patents.", "Qualcomm licensed chips exclusively to original equipment manufacturers (OEMs), such as smartphone manufacturers, and, under its so-called “no license, no chips” policy, refused to sell modem chips to OEMs that did not sign patent license agreements requiring them to promise not to resell Qualcomm’s chips.", "The FTC alleged that this policy, along with certain of Qualcomm’s exclusive licensing agreements and purportedly “anticompetitive surcharges” imposed by Qualcomm’s patent-licensing royalties, harmed competition by preventing rival chipmakers from competing in the modem chip markets.2 The FTC also alleged that Qualcomm’s conduct violated commitments made to standard-setting organizations (SSOs) that the SEPs in Qualcomm’s portfolio would be licensed on fair, reasonable and nondiscriminatory (FRAND) terms.", "The case was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California in January 2017 and was presided over by Judge Lucy H. Koh.", "Notably, after trial but before Judge Koh had issued a final decision, the Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice (DOJ) took the unusual step of filing a “statement of interest” in its sister agency’s case, expressing concern over the impact that an overly broad remedy could have on the markets for 5G technology.3", "In May 2019, Judge Koh issued an opinion siding with the FTC, finding Qualcomm’s “no license, no chips” policy anticompetitive and concluding that its refusal to license to rival chipmakers violated both its FRAND commitments and an antitrust “duty to deal.”4", "Judge Koh issued a permanent, worldwide injunction ordering, among other things, Qualcomm to make its patents available to rival chipmakers and prohibiting Qualcomm from conditioning the supply of modem chips on whether a customer has purchased a license.", "The decision drew immediate criticism — including from current FTC Commissioner Christine S. Wilson — for significantly expanding the circumstances under which a company is required to do business with its competitors under Section 2 of the Sherman Act.5 Qualcomm promptly sought and won a partial stay of the injunction pending its appeal, supported by declarations from the Departments of Defense and Energy that emphasized Qualcomm’s leadership in 5G technology and the affiliated national security benefits.", "In the appeal, Qualcomm also received merits amicus support from the DOJ,6 as well as from former Federal Circuit Chief Judges Paul R. Michel and Randall Rader, among others.", "In its highly anticipated decision, the Ninth Circuit panel unanimously rejected the lower court’s reasoning, vacating the judgment and reversing the worldwide injunction against Qualcomm.", "The panel concluded that the district court had erroneously imposed the antitrust duty to deal on Qualcomm, had impermissibly looked outside the relevant antitrust market in order to infer an anticompetitive act and had relied on outdated evidence of agreements that were terminated before the suit was filed to justify a broad, forward-looking global injunction.", "The Ninth Circuit further rejected the argument that a SEP holder’s violation of FRAND commitments could independently create antitrust liability, instead pointing to patent and contract law as sources for potential remedies.", "The decision reflects a considered effort to rein in the district court’s expansive interpretation of general antitrust principles and their specific application to SEP holders, as well as recognition that the antitrust laws aim to preserve companies’ incentives to innovate and compete.", "Recognizing that while “[a]nticompetitive behavior is illegal under federal antitrust law[,]” the panel was adamant that “[h]ypercompetitive behavior is not.”7", "Rejection of District Court’s Expansive Interpretation of Antitrust Laws", "The Ninth Circuit decision contains several notable conclusions regarding the scope of Section 2 of the Sherman Act and what constitutes cognizable antitrust harm.", "First, the court reaffirmed that there is no general duty to deal with competitors beyond the limited exception found in Aspen Skiing Co. v. Aspen Highlands Skiing Corp., 472 U.S. 585 (1985), no such claim existed against Qualcomm where there was scant evidence of a prior course of dealing (as required by post-Aspen Skiing Ninth Circuit precedent) and clear data showed that Qualcomm’s licensing practices were more profitable in both the short and long term.8", "Second, the Ninth Circuit repeatedly emphasized that the district court had failed to adequately account for the realities of the marketplace and the actual impact of Qualcomm’s practices in the relevant market.", "In applying the antitrust rule of reason to the FTC’s monopolization claims, the court noted that it was the FTC’s initial burden to demonstrate that Qualcomm’s practices had a significant anticompetitive effect in the relevant market — here, the markets for CDMA and LTE cellular modem chips.9", "The lower court had reasoned that Qualcomm’s refusal to license its SEPs to competitor chip manufacturers created an anticompetitive surcharge for OEMs that used non-Qualcomm chips.10 But the Ninth Circuit rejected this argument, concluding that it was impermissible for a court to infer anticompetitive conduct harming Qualcomm’s competitors simply from higher prices paid by OEM customers.11 Merely identifying a monopoly and inferring harm from high prices will not satisfy a plaintiff’s burden, the court noted, as the Sherman Act does not prohibit a monopolist from simply charging high prices.12", "The panel pointed to Ohio v. Am. Express Co., 138 S. Ct. 2274, 2284 (2018), as establishing the proposition that new technologies and new business strategies could be mistaken for anticompetitive conduct by regulators while actually being procompetitive.13 Indeed, in Qualcomm, as in AmEx, the Ninth Circuit found the challenged conduct to have spurred fiercer competition, as evidenced by the successful entry and expansion of other major chip firms and the continued decline of OEM prices.14 The Ninth Circuit reiterated that plaintiffs must clearly show anticompetitive harm in the market, rather than simply pin antitrust liability on the ability to charge prices higher than what regulators may perceive to be “reasonable.”", "Clarification of Limits of Antitrust’s Application to SEP-Related Conduct", "In addition to addressing general antitrust principles, the Ninth Circuit also clarified the intersection of antitrust law and claimed breaches of FRAND commitments, issuing a near-total rejection of the use of antitrust laws to police such conduct.", "The FTC had alleged that, regardless of a duty to deal, Qualcomm’s breach of its voluntary commitment to license on FRAND terms itself constituted an antitrust violation.", "The court rejected the FTC’s claims, noting the “persuasive policy arguments” against applying antitrust law to FRAND breaches.", "The FTC premised its SEP-based claims solely on the “intentional deception” theory articulated in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit’s decision in Broadcom Corp. v. Qualcomm Inc.", "Broadcom had held that a patent holder’s intentional false promise to license essential patents on FRAND terms, coupled with the SSO’s reliance on that promise and the patent holder’s subsequent breach of the promise, could constitute a Section 2 violation.15 The Ninth Circuit rejected the FTC’s argument because unlike in Broadcom, “the district court found neither intentional deception of SSOs on the part of Qualcomm nor that Qualcomm charged discriminatorily higher royalty rates to competitors and OEM customers using non-Qualcomm chips.”16", "Thus, even the “Third Circuit’s ... exception to the general rule that breaches of SSO commitments do not give rise to antitrust liability” did not apply to the FTC’s claims.", "The Ninth Circuit went on to criticize the Broadcom exception itself and the FTC’s attempt to apply the antitrust laws to breaches of FRAND commitments, a subject of significant debate and criticism from regulators and commentators, including Assistant Attorney General Makan Delrahim,17 Ohlhausen18 — at the time the FTC’s acting chair — and even current FTC Chair Joseph J. Simons.19 The Ninth Circuit noted the “persuasive policy arguments of several academics and practitioners with significant experience in SSOs, FRAND, and antitrust enforcement,” focusing on critiques from former FTC Commissioner Joshua D. Wright and Judge Michel.20", "Finally, the Ninth Circuit also rejected the district court’s finding that Qualcomm’s royalty rates were anticompetitive because they were “unreasonable.”", "The Ninth Circuit emphasized that the FTC’s theory and the district court’s holding that patent royalties must “precisely reflect a patent’s current, intrinsic value and are in line with the rates other companies charge” was based on patent theories, not antitrust theories.21 Given that, the court refused to “to adopt a theory of antitrust liability that would presume anticompetitive conduct any time a company could not prove that the ‘fair value’ of its SEP portfolios corresponds to the prices the market appears willing to pay for those SEPs in the form of licensing royalty rates.”22", "The Ninth Circuit also criticized the district court for its incorrect interpretation of Federal Circuit law addressing the use of the “smallest saleable patent-practicing unit” as a metric in patent royalty disputes and its application of those principles to an antitrust case.23", "The Ninth Circuit opinion reins in a sprawling district court decision that, in the panel’s view, exceeded the bounds of antitrust jurisprudence and threatened to dampen the type of innovative, “hypercompetitive” behavior that the antitrust laws aim to encourage.", "As a result, the narrow interpretation of Aspen Skiing, whereby an antitrust duty to deal can only arise in circumscribed circumstances, remains intact.", "The decision’s conclusion that purported anticompetitive harms must be experienced in the relevant market and demonstrably harm competition — not individual competitors, and not just customers — will require greater rigor from antitrust plaintiffs in future cases.", "Finally, the decision has significant implications for SEP holders accused of antitrust violations resulting from purported breaches of FRAND.", "The Ninth Circuit’s caution against using “the hammer of antitrust law ... to resolve FRAND disputes when more precise scalpels of contract and patent law are effective”24 clarifies the boundary of antitrust law where plaintiffs have in recent years been pushing to broaden its scope.", "The Qualcomm dispute has served as a continuing source of friction between the two U.S. antitrust enforcers, particularly given the DOJ’s public interjection in its sister agency’s case.", "The FTC has not yet said whether it will seek en banc review at the Ninth Circuit or petition the U.S. Supreme Court for certioriari.", "1 In the Matter of Qualcomm, Inc., Dissenting Statement of Commissioner Maureen K.

All licensors of SEPs have a dominant market position.", "Other than the record-setting penalty, one of the most significant implications of the Qualcomm decision is that it was the first instance in which an antimonopoly enforcement agency in China such as the NDRC has stated and recognized that holders of SEPs have a dominant market position, and that licensing of technologies (particularly SEPs) may constitute monopolistic conduct.", "In other words, the NDRC concluded that because of the nature of SEPs, a holder or exclusive licensee would be deemed to have market dominance per se and run a risk of antitrust violations in China if its licensing scheme does not comply with the AML.", "Further, unlike antitrust breaches in other cases where dominant market position is determined by market shares, each licensor of an SEP has the power to impose unreasonable and unfair licensing terms, regardless of the number of SEPs and the percentage of SEPs it owns within a standard.", "Therefore, based on NDRC’s stance in the penalty decision, we do not believe that a licensor with few SEPs is more likely to avoid antitrust violations based on that ground.", "Private parties may elect to pursue antitrust violations in the judiciary system (as in the case of Huawei v. InterDigital, Shenzhen Intermediate People’s Court (2013), Guangdong High People’s Court (2013)) or file an administrative complaint with an antimonopoly enforcement agency such as the NDRC, or both.2", "These two procedures have different implications. Judicial proceedings involving antitrust violations single out licensing practices with individual licensees, while administrative proceedings may have a more profound effect on the patentees in terms of both financial damage and equitable remedies.", "For example, NDRC fined Qualcomm US$975 million, based on 8% of the patentee’s sales revenue, while the Shenzhen court merely awarded Huawei US$3.51 million to cover the attorney fees.", "In addition, the rectification plan committed by the licensor will be binding on all of its prospective licenses (and may also amend existing licenses, allowing existing licensees to renegotiate their licensing terms).", "However, while a court may have this capability, complainants should not rely on antimonopoly enforcement agencies to set or provide a basis for calculating a FRAND rate for the license.", "It can be derived from the Qualcomm decision (and the other administrative antitrust decisions) that there are recommended do’s and don’ts that licensors should keep in mind during negotiation of SEP licenses that cover Chinese patents, e.g.:", "- Offer a patent list in the license negotiations.", "- Offer non-discriminatory and reasonable royalty rates, consistent with any FRAND rate applied.", "- Resort to arbitration to resolve disputes regarding royalty rates.", "- Bundle patents that cover different standards in a portfolio.", "- Apply no-challenge clauses as a pre-requisite to license SEPs or supply products.", "- Request any reciprocal cross licenses for no consideration.", "- Condition SEP licenses on grants of reciprocal cross licenses (but it may be acceptable if the cross licenses are related to the same standard).", "- Restrict licensees' on its use of the licensed SEPs.", "While permissible licensing practices should be determined on an ad hoc basis, under Qualcomm’s rectification plan, it can be observed that the NDRC does not object to the following licensing practices, at least in the case of Qualcomm:", "- Charge licensee-buyers separately on the basis of the costs of the baseband chips plus royalty rates on the applicable technologies.", "- Calculate royalties based on a portion of the wholesale price of the finished products, even though the subject matter of the license only relates to a key component of such product (assuming and provided that the finished product actually performs the patented subject matter).", "While it was neither addressed nor apparently considered in the NDRC’s Qualcomm decision, there is a possibility that the rectified licensing scheme may run afoul of the patent exhaustion doctrine under PRC Patent Law, which provides that an affirmative defense to infringement may be available if a party uses, offers to sell, sell or imports a product after the sale of a patented product or a product obtained directly by a patented process by the patentee.", "In any event, since the rectification plan is customized for the licensing practice of Qualcomm, it may have limited probative value for other licensors.", "Specifically, the decision does not provide any basis or guidance on reasonable royalty rates in the industry.", "Furthermore, not only does the decision fail to refer to FRAND rates, but the reduced royalty rates in the rectification plan are discriminatively lower than the standard royalty rate Qualcomm charges in other jurisdictions.", "While it is not specified in the penalty decision, the scope of NDRC’s decision (and the rectification plan) would also be territorial in nature, adopting language that focused on (i) licensing of Chinese SEPs (ii) to Chinese smartphone manufacturers (iii) for use in China in various instances.", "It remains unclear whether Qualcomm will adhere to the terms of the rectification plan in its worldwide licenses to Chinese manufacturers, or separate the Chinese license from the global license as a result of the decision.", "However, based on the FRAND principle, it is foreseeable that Qualcomm will face requests from its licensees to extend the (lower) license rates under the rectification plan to licenses involving other jurisdiction.", "It wasn’t until recently that Chinese law makers have begun drafting laws and regulatory guidelines to address antitrust issues in the abuse of IP rights.", "Specifically, to raise awareness of this issue and provide guiding references on the licensing of SEPs, the SAIC has released draft regulations on Prohibition of Abuse of Intellectual Property Rights to Eliminate and Restrict Competitions in June 2014 for public comments.", "- Recognition that certain conduct related to the licensing of IP may be deemed monopolistic in nature, especially if the IP is essential to the business activity, e.g., the IP is essential for other player to enter the market and there is no design-around available.", "- Licensors with a dominant market position may not refuse to grant licenses for others to use any essential IP under reasonable terms.", "- Bundling of IP or products of different nature is not permitted.", "- Licenses by licensors with dominant market positions may not contain the following conditions: request for grant-back licenses; inclusion of no-challenge clauses; charging royalties on expired patents; restriction of licensees from dealing with third parties; and any other unreasonable conditions.", "While the draft regulations have not been finalized and promulgated, they may provide some further insights on the licensing of SEPs.", "We have singled out two main questions regarding the licensing of SEPs not addressed in the Qualcomm decision:", "1. Compliance of AML in license of non-Chinese SEPs / to non-Chinese phone makers.", "While the NDRC claimed to have collected evidence from both Chinese and foreign smartphone makers in the investigation, its findings appear to be mostly based on Qualcomm’s monopolistic licensing practices against Chinese companies and licensees.", "In response, the rectification plan covers licensing terms that are almost exclusively applicable to Chinese licensees and their devices sold for use in China.", "It is quite obvious that a main driving force behind NDRC’s sanctions was to protect the interest of Chinese manufacturers.", "Therefore, the question is whether the NDRC or another antimonopoly enforcement agency will apply the same level of enthusiasm in protecting the interest of foreign licensees against holders of Chinese SEP, even if a significant number of their mobile devices are sold to Chinese consumers.", "In other words, what are the risks of antitrust violations by SEP holders when they are negotiating licenses to non-Chinese companies for use in China, or to Chinese multinational companies for global licenses not limited to China?", "Should the licensor be overly concerned to ensure that the licensing terms comply with the AML?", "We believe that the answer would depend on (i) the origin of the licensee, (ii) the market share of the licensee in China and (iii) the amount of the licensor’s revenue from royalties it derives in China.", "Depending on the “nexus” of its licensing activities with China, it may be preferable for the licensee to seek an opinion on compliance with AML, or even to grant a Chinese license separate from its global license to avoid any potential sanction by the NDRC.", "\"Nexus\" with China and risks for antitrust violations in China / Chinese licensee / Non-Chinese licensee", "- Licensing of SEPs for use in China (e.g. Chinese patents) / High risk / Lower risk", "- Licensing of SEPs for use outside of China / Lower risk / No risk", "For example, under the above table, for licensing of an SEP to Xiaomi, which is currently the top smartphone maker in China by unit sold and is predominantly a local brand, the “nexus” is high and the licensor should ensure that its licensing scheme is in compliance with AML.", "For licenses with China-based multinational smartphone makers such as Huawei and ZTE, due to their strong government ties, the licensee should also carefully consider the AML, regardless of the territory of the license, especially when cross licenses of IP from those companies are sought.", "The same may apply to a license with Samsung or Apple, whose products are highly popular in China. While it may not be a priority for the NDRC to protect their interests, a resourceful foreign licensee may also take advantage of the Qualcomm decision and threaten to file complaint with the NDRC, incurring risks of antitrust investigations against the licensor.", "2. Whether licensor must comply with FRAND standard in licensing of SEP.", "Even though FRAND rates have been mentioned and adopted in other administrative and court decisions regarding the license of SEPs (e.g., Huawei v. InterDigital, InterDigital and Microsoft antitrust probes) as well as the draft regulations, it was not applied by the NDRC in the Qualcomm decisions.", "Specifically, contrary to Huawei v. InterDigital, no discussion that the royalty rate must be under the FRAND term was made by the NDRC.", "If the FRAND rate is not the sole standard, another question that was not answered in Qualcomm is the existence of a proper and objective basis for computing reasonable royalty rates for the licensing of SEPs.", "To the contrary, the reduced royalty rate to be charged by Qualcomm under its rectification plan is lower in China than in other territories, making the licensing terms more favorable to Chinese phone makers and thereby creating inconsistencies and departing from the FRAND term.", "In any event, based on the proceedings in investigations by the NDRC, it may ultimately be up to the licensor to prove that the license rate adopted or committed by it is not unreasonable in light of all of the circumstances.", "As the Qualcomm decision did not address the above issues, they remain unanswered for now, and licensors will need to evaluate their own risks and proceed to implement their own licensing programs in China with considerable caution.", "1) The NDRC explained that while a licensor may request for cross licenses under the AML, consideration must be given for such cross-licenses.", "2) In Huawei v. InterDigital, Huawei filed two complaints in the Shenzhen Intermediate People’s Court claiming that InterDigital had violated the AML by abusing its market dominant position in its SEP license negotiations and requested the court to determine the FRAND rate for the license.", "It was the first judicial case acknowledging and applying the concept of SEPs and FRAND rate in China."]}

FTC Commissioner Christine Wilson, for example, publicly noted her personal (non-official) disagreement with Judge Koh’s decision.1 Specifically, Wilson criticized the court’s analysis of the duty to deal with and aid competitors under Aspen Skiing Co. v. Aspen Highlands Skiing Corp., 472 U.S. 585, 595 (1985).", "Wilson also criticized the broad nature of the remedy Judge Koh crafted, suggesting that it was not appropriately tailored to the identified competitive harm.", "The Ninth Circuit granted Qualcomm’s motion to expedite an appeal. Accordingly, on August 23, 2019, Qualcomm filed its opening brief appealing Judge Koh’s decision to the Ninth Circuit, including the FTC’s novel “tax” or “surcharge” theory of antitrust liability and Qualcomm’s duty to deal in the standard-setting context.", "Despite Judge Koh’s denial of Qualcomm’s motion for a stay of her decision pending appeal, on August 23, the Ninth Circuit granted Qualcomm’s motion for a partial stay, maintaining the status quo during the expedited appeal.2 While not deciding the issue of “[w]hether the district court’s order and injunction represent a trailblazing application of the antitrust laws, or instead an improper excursion beyond the outer limits of the Sherman Act,” the Ninth Circuit concluded Qualcomm had demonstrated that a stay was warranted.3 In its order, the Ninth Circuit noted that the Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice (“DOJ”) “filed a statement of interest expressing its stark disagreement [with the FTC] that Qualcomm has any antitrust duty to deal with rival chip suppliers.”4", "The Ninth Circuit further held that Qualcomm “made the requisite showing that its practice of charging OEMs royalties for its patents on a per-handset basis does not violate the antitrust laws.”5", "The Ninth Circuit noted that the balance of equities favored the stay as “the government itself is divided about the propriety of the judgment and its impact on the public interest [because] the Department of Defense and Department of Energy aver that the injunction threatens national security, and the DOJ posits that the injunction has the effect of harming rather than benefitting consumers.”6", "The appeal is currently calendared for January 2020.", "While the debate surrounding this decision will continue throughout the appeal process, companies with significant market shares engaged in the licensing of IP for important inputs should be cautious and assess any similar types of conduct as that at issue in the Qualcomm case.", "Please contact us for additional information or if you have any questions or concerns about how this decision applies to your business.", "1Christine Wilson, “A Court’s Dangerous Antitrust Overreach,” May 28, 2019, available at https://www.wsj.com/articles/a-courts-dangerous-antitrust-overreach-11559085055", "2Fed.

Various companies manufacture such chipsets, and the phones into which they are incorporated. To function properly, however, cell phones and chipsets made by different manufacturers must be capable of interfacing with each other.", "(Id. at 13.) To ensure the interoperability of different cell phones, the wireless industry works with several standards development organizations (\"SDOs\") to develop wireless communications standards.", "(Id.) The standards that are established may be comprised of patented technology. (Id. at 14.) An SDO may require a patent-holder to agree to license the patent on fair, reasonable, and non-discriminatory (\"FRAND\") terms before it agrees to incorporate the patent into the standard.", "(Id.)

Many of the patents are essential for CDMA systems and chipsets.", "(Id.) Broadcom asserts that (1) Qualcomm used its power over CDMA technology to obtain and protect monopoly power in the CDMA chipset markets, and (2) this monopoly is due to exclusionary and anticompetitive conduct, and not business acumen.", "(Id. at 21-23.) For example, Broadcom alleges that Qualcomm (1) has threatened cell phone manufacturers with the loss of certain benefits if they purchase chipsets from a Qualcomm competitor, (2) reduces royalty rates when a company obtaining a patent license from Qualcomm agrees to purchase Qualcomm chipsets exclusively, and (3) has manipulated the SDOs to ensure that the third generation (\"3G\") CDMA standard is in a form Qualcomm prefers.", "(Id. at 24-26.)

The amended complaint contains many allegations of anticompetitive conduct on the part of Qualcomm.", "The alleged conduct, however, can be summarized and grouped into three categories; Qualcomm's acts of (1) refusing to license its WCDMA technology on FRAND terms, (2) tying the sale of its UMTS chipsets to the license for its WCDMA patents, and (3) offering discounts and inducements to buyers agreeing not to use the chipsets of a Qualcomm competitor.", "(Id. at 5-8, 30-36.) Examples of Qualcomm's alleged refusal to license its patents on FRAND terms include its demands for (1) royalties on unpatented components, (2) nonreciprocal patent rights, (3) double-royalties, (4) excessive royalty rates, and (5) anticompetitive information exchanges, from potential UMTS licensees.", "(Id. at 30-34.) As to the alleged tying arrangement, Broadcom alleges that Qualcomm requires WCDMA licensees to pay multi-million dollar licensing fees unless they agree to purchase Qualcomm chipsets exclusively.", "(Id. at 35.)

Qualcomm, Finding No Antitrust Violations from Qualcomm’s Licensing of its Standard-Essential Patents", "In a reversal that came as no surprise to many observers, on Tuesday, August 11, 2020, a unanimous panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit reversed the decision by the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California in FTC v. Qualcomm and vacated the district court’s worldwide, permanent injunction prohibiting several of Qualcomm Incorporated’s (“Qualcomm”) licensing practices with respect to standard-essential patents (“SEPs”) covering cellular technology.", "In reversing the district court’s decision, the Ninth Circuit held that Qualcomm had no antitrust duty to license its SEPs to rival chip suppliers and that the FTC failed to establish anticompetitive effects to the cellular chip market arising from Qualcomm’s patent licensing practices.", "This was a controversial and closely watched case by both antitrust and intellectual property practitioners, academics and enforcement agencies.", "The FTC brought the suit in 2017 on a 2-1 partisan vote over the strong and unusual objection of Commissioner Ohlhausen.", "As described below, Qualcomm used its monopoly power in aggressive and strategic ways, but as the Ninth Circuit concluded, within its rights as the owner of valuable intellectual property.", "Qualcomm is a cellular technology company that holds patents to technological innovations relating to modern cellular technology, including third-generation (“3G”) CDMA and fourth-generation (“4G”) LTE cellular standards practiced in most modern smartphone devices.", "Qualcomm licenses these patents to original equipment manufacturers (“OEMs”), such as mobile phone manufacturers/suppliers, whose devices practice CDMA and premium LTE technologies.", "In addition to its patent licensing business, Qualcomm also manufactures and sells cellular modem chips, the hardware that enables devices to communicate using these technology standards, to OEMs.", "Qualcomm’s patent portfolio includes standard-essential patents (“SEPs”) for CDMA and premium LTE technologies found in all modern smartphone devices.", "SEPs are patents on technologies that international standard-setting organizations (“SSOs”) choose to adopt as the technological standards practiced by each new generation of cellular technology; SEPs are therefore necessary to practice a particular standard.", "In order to ensure that SEPs are available to all industry participants, SSOs require SEP holders who participate in the standards setting process to commit to license their SEPs on fair, reasonable, and nondiscriminatory (“FRAND”) terms.", "This commitment is generally set forth in agreements between the SSO and its members.", "Qualcomm licenses its patents exclusively to OEMs; it does not license its patents to rival chip suppliers.", "These patents can include SEPs, non-cellular SEPs, and non-SEPs. Qualcomm enforces a “no license, no chips” policy, under which it refuses to sell its chips to OEMs that do not also take the licenses to practice its SEPs.", "Qualcomm sets the royalty rates for its CDMA and LTE patent portfolios as a percentage of the end-product sales price.", "The reason Qualcomm does not license its SEPs to competing chip suppliers is to avoid “patent exhaustion,” whereby OEMs could purchase chips from Qualcomm’s rival chip manufacturers without paying for the licenses themselves.", "However, because those competing chip suppliers must practice Qualcomm’s SEPs in their own chips by necessity, Qualcomm grants these competing chip suppliers a covenant not to sue, effectively allowing these chip suppliers a royalty-free license enabling them to practice the SEPs.", "In exchange, these competing chip suppliers must report their supply agreements with OEMs to Qualcomm.", "Qualcomm then charges OEMs a per-unit licensing royalty for the use of chips manufactured by Qualcomm’s rivals that utilize Qualcomm’s SEPs.", "As a result, OEMs pay royalties to Qualcomm for the SEPs regardless of which company they choose to source their chips from.", "In January 2017, the FTC sued Qualcomm for equitable relief in the Northern District of California, alleging that Qualcomm’s patent licensing practices excluded competitors and harmed competition in the modem chip markets in violation of the Federal Trade Commission Act and Sections 1 and 2 of the Sherman Act.", "In May 2019, the district court issued its opinion finding that Qualcomm violated federal antitrust laws by (1) refusing to license its SEPs to its direct competitors in the modern chips markets; (2) imposing an anticompetitive surcharge on rival chip manufacturers’ chip sales through its patent licensing and “no license, no chips” policies to OEMs; and (3) entering into exclusive dealing arrangements with Apple in 2011 and 2013.", "In a unanimous opinion, the three-judge panel reversed the district court’s decision and held that the FTC failed to satisfy its initial burden under the rule of reason framework to prove that the challenged restraint had a substantial effect that harmed consumers in the relevant market for CDMA and premium LTE chips.", "Accordingly, the Court vacated the worldwide permanent injunction relating to Qualcomm’s patent licensing practices.", "Refusal to License to Rival Chip Manufacturers Is Not an Antitrust Violation", "The Ninth Circuit held that the exception provided by Aspen Skiing creating an antitrust duty to deal with competitors did not apply because Qualcomm’s switch to licensing exclusively to OEMs did not meet any of the three required elements of the exception.", "The Aspen Skiing exception requires (i) the unilateral termination of a “voluntary and profitable course of dealing,” (ii) the only conceivable rationale or purpose of which is to “sacrifice short-term benefits in order to obtain higher profits in the long run from the exclusion of competition,” and (iii) the refusal to deal involves products that the defendant already sells in the existing market to other similarly situated customers.", "In contrast, the Court noted that Qualcomm ceased its prior practice following developments in patent laws that made it more difficult to provide “non-exhaustive licenses,” that licensing exclusively to OEMs was profitable in both the short and long run, and that unlike in Aspen Skiing, the district court found no evidence that Qualcomm singles out any specific chip manufacturer for anticompetitive treatment in its SEP-licensing.", "The Court also found the district court’s application of the Aspen Skiing exception in this case ignored the Supreme Court’s subsequent warning in Trinko that the Aspen Skiing exception should be applied only in rare circumstances.", "Indeed, the FTC itself conceded the district court’s error in that regard.", "No Antitrust Violation for Breach of SSO Commitments", "The Ninth Circuit held that the FTC failed to establish a Sherman Act violation arising from Qualcomm’s breach of its contractual SSO obligations absent evidence that the breach impaired the opportunities of its rivals in the CDMA and LTE chip markets.", "The Court concluded that any alleged harm from Qualcomm’s breach of SSO commitments was borne by OEMs, not rival chip manufacturers.", "Because Qualcomm’s royalties were “chip-supplier neutral,” the royalty rates are based on the portfolio chosen by the OEM customer regardless of where the OEM sources its chips.", "With regard to the CDMA and LTE chip markets, the Court pointedly noted that the FTC “identifies no such harm to competition,” as Qualcomm’s rival chip suppliers are permitted to practice Qualcomm’s SEPs royalty-free.", "The Court also found unpersuasive the FTC’s reliance on Broadcom v. Qualcomm given the lack of allegations relating to Qualcomm’s deception during the standards setting process and discriminatory charging for royalties dispositive to that decision.", "Finally, the Court noted that “[a]bsent a showing of harm to competition, antitrust is not an appropriate regime for resolving contractual disputes.”", "The FTC argued that by setting “unreasonably high” royalty rates, Qualcomm controlled its rival chip manufacturers’ prices by increasing the “all-in” price of its rivals’ chips to include the nominal chip price and Qualcomm’s royalty surcharge.", "The Ninth Circuit held that at worst, the “no license, no chips” policy might raise the price and harm Qualcomm’s customers, not its rivals in the relevant market.", "Furthermore, the Court emphasized that the Sherman Act does not prohibit Qualcomm from either licensing SEPs independent from chip sales and collecting royalties or limiting their chip customer base to licensed OEMs; Qualcomm’s policy would only raise potential antitrust concerns if it were exclusionary conduct in the form of “no chips, no license” in which Qualcomm refused to license its SEPs to OEMs unless they first agreed to purchase Qualcomm’s chips.", "However, unlike that situation, under Qualcomm’s “no license, no chips” policy, it makes no difference to Qualcomm whether the OEM purchases the Qualcomm chip or a rival’s chip.", "The Court likened “no license, no chips” to the novel business practice in American Express that “at first appeared to be anticompetitive, but in fact was disruptive in a manner that was beneficial to customers in the long run.”", "Exclusive Dealing Arrangements with Apple Were Not Anticompetitive", "While recognizing the merit in the district court’s conclusion that Qualcomm’s agreements with Apple in 2011 and 2013 were structured similar to exclusive dealing contracts, the Court held that the agreements did not have the actual or practical effect of substantially foreclosing competition in the CDMA modem chip market.", "Notably, the Court was persuaded by the record that no specific competitor or potential competitor was affected by either of the agreements, as there were no viable competitors to Qualcomm prior to 2014.", "The Ninth Circuit’s reversal of the district court’s decision reinforces the long-standing principle that plaintiffs seeking to allege antitrust violations must meet their burden of showing anticompetitive harm to the relevant market.", "Here, the FTC failed to show that Qualcomm’s practice of licensing exclusively to OEMs (and not rival chip manufacturers) amounted to a violation of the Sherman Act, as Qualcomm has no antitrust duty to license its rival chip manufacturers.", "To the extent that Qualcomm breached any of its SSO commitments by charging non-FRAND royalty rates, the Court emphatically noted that the remedy for such a breach lies in contract and patent law, not antitrust.", "Furthermore, the Court held that Qualcomm’s “no license, no chips” policy was not an antitrust violation absent any showing of harm in the relevant markets.", "The Ninth Circuit’s reversal of the district court decision serves as a reminder that plaintiffs bringing antitrust claims still bear the initial burden under the rule of reason framework to show anticompetitive harm to the relevant market.", "The last word on the “no license, no chips” approach may still be to come as this case is, of course, subject to appeal to the Supreme Court and a cert petition may well be filed.", "In any event, this is a big, if not unexpected win for Qualcomm."]}

Consequently, Qualcomm is presumptively entitled to demand high prices—or other concessions—for its chips.", "It is not inherently problematic for a firm to supply both SEP licenses and a physical product to the same customers.", "But Qualcomm intertwines its chip sales and SEP licensing, instituting what the FTC has called a “no license–no chips” policy.", "Qualcomm effectively ties its chips to its licenses, threatening to cut off the chip supply to any manufacturer who rejects its preferred licensing terms.", "Furthermore, the company’s terms are accompanied by provisions designed to ensure that manufacturers continue to buy chipsets exclusively from Qualcomm.", "It charges an unusually high royalty rate by default but offers licensees large “rebates” or “incentives,” essentially partial reimbursements, that reduce the effective royalty rate.", "Such rebates, however, are available only if the manufacturer buys chips exclusively, or nearly so, from Qualcomm.", "On final judgment, U.S. District Court Judge Lucy Koh found that this arrangement constituted anticompetitive exclusive dealing.", "This portion of the opinion argues quite effectively that Qualcomm’s conduct likely acted to maintain higher-than-competitive prices by forestalling competition in the chipset market.", "In a nutshell, the court’s theory of harm was that manufacturers are largely compelled to accept Qualcomm’s restrictive licensing terms due to its near-monopoly in the chipset market.", "And these agreements further secured the exclusivity Qualcomm needed to maintain its dominance.", "The case is a good example of the potential problems that can arise when an SEP owner ties its licenses to a complementary input such as a chipset.", "As I have argued elsewhere, tying may provide a backdoor means of violating a FRAND agreement even in cases where the SEP owner does not hold a monopoly over the complementary good.", "Although FRAND acts to cap the royalty rate at a “reasonable” level, the SEP owner may attempt to get around this by applying its desired markup to a complementary good instead, which it then ties to its SEP licenses.", "Similarly, public utilities have occasionally sought to circumvent regulatory price controls by tying the regulated service to an unregulated complement, such as tying telephone service to a lease for telephone equipment.", "A second component of the Qualcomm decision is more precarious. Judge Koh held that Qualcomm’s refusal to license rival chip makers such as Intel was an anticompetitive “refusal to deal.”", "Separately, she concluded that Qualcomm’s FRAND agreements created a contractual duty to license rivals, although that ruling has limited bearing on the FTC’s antitrust claim.", "There is some precedent for finding antitrust liability where a firm’s refusal to deal with a rival is motivated solely by the prospect of excluding the rival, although this doctrine is very narrow in scope.", "Nevertheless, Judge Koh concluded that Qualcomm’s refusals satisfied the relevant criteria for antitrust liability.", "What the court and the parties neglected to mention is that the Patent Act explicitly states that a refusal to license does not constitute patent “misuse or illegal extension of the patent.”", "This language arguably creates antitrust immunity for refusals to license. Although the antitrust agencies have previously disputed this interpretation, it remains an unresolved question.", "Moreover, Judge Koh’s opinion does not discuss any connection between FRAND and a potential antitrust duty to license.", "In principle, the court might have concluded that a FRAND commitment impliedly waives the statutory immunity for refusals to license.", "But even then, it is not obvious that the waiver would clear a path for antitrust enforcement, as opposed to an action under contract law.", "In the end, the district court’s recent decision sidesteps these thorny issues.

(Apple) that provided substantial incentive payments (i.e., pricing discounts) if Apple sourced its iPhone modem chips exclusively from Qualcomm.", "In 2014, however, Apple terminated these contracts and purchased the modem chips for its 2016 model from Intel.", "The district court held that Qualcomm’s conduct had violated Section 2 of the Sherman Act by monopolizing the markets for CDMA and Premium LTE chips and that its exclusive purchasing agreements violated Section 1 of the Sherman Act by unreasonably restraining trade in those markets.", "It also held that the refusal to license rival chip makers both breached its FRAND commitments and constituted predatory conduct violating Section 2.", "Further, it’s No License, No Chips policy was held to be an anticompetitive practice. Finally, its “unreasonably high royalty rates” in conjunction with its No License, No Chips policy were considered “an artificial and anticompetitive surcharge on its rivals’ chip sales.”", "As a remedy, the district court entered a worldwide injunction prohibiting the foregoing practices and requiring Qualcomm to re-negotiate all of its sales contracts that had resulted from the implementation of these policies.", "Qualcomm appealed the injunction, and the appeals court stayed the injunction. In a highly unusual move, the Antitrust Division of the United States Department of Justice filed amicus briefs supporting the stay and later supporting a reversal.", "The appeals court declined to opine on whether Qualcomm’s insistence on licensing only OEM manufacturers and not rival chip manufacturers violated its FRAND commitments.", "However, whether or not such refusal gave rise to a contract or patent law claim, the court held that it did not violate the antitrust laws.", "The antitrust laws, the court noted, generally impose no duty on a trader to deal with a competitor. The limited exception under Aspen Skiing Co. v. Aspen Highlands Skiing Corp.,2 applies only where (i) a monopolist has unilaterally terminated a voluntary and profitable course of dealing with a competitor, (ii) the only conceivable rationale for the refusal to deal is to sacrifice short-term profits to obtain higher profits in the long run from the exclusion of competition, and (iii) the refusal to deal involves products the defendant already sells to others in an existing market.", "In Verizon Communications, Inc. v. Trinko,3 the Supreme Court described this exception as “at or near the outer boundary of §2 liability.”", "Here, according to the appeals court, Qualcomm did not terminate a voluntary course of dealing with competing chip producers because it never granted licenses to rival chip manufacturers.", "Instead, it entered into royalty-bearing licenses with OEMs. Nor did its practice involve sacrificing short term profits to obtain larger monopoly profits in the long run.", "As the district court found, the practice of licensing OEMs maximized both its short term and its long term profits.", "Moreover, its practice was adopted as a response to developments in the doctrine of patent exhaustion, not to sacrifice short term profits for long term gains.", "Finally, Qualcomm was not singling out a specific chip competitor for anticompetitive treatment. The appeals court specifically distinguished Qualcomm’s refusal to license rival chip makers from cases involving an SEP holder’s deception of an SSO regarding such a commitment that leads to the SSO’s adoption of the holder’s technology as part of the SSO’s standards.", "Here, neither district court nor appeals court found evidence of deception or charging discriminatorily higher royalty rates to competing customers.", "The appeals court also held that the district court’s theory that Qualcomm’s “unreasonably high” royalty rates constituted an anticompetitive surcharge on its rivals’ chips was incorrect.", "First, the district court’s determination that the royalties were unreasonably high because they were based on handset prices was misplaced.", "In addition to misapplying patent damage rules to interpret the antitrust laws, the district court erroneously assumed that royalties are anticompetitive under the antitrust laws when they are higher than the patent’s current intrinsic value and higher than the royalties other companies charge on similar patents.", "The antitrust laws, however, do not limit the price a monopolist may charge. Moreover, whether the amount of the royalties was reasonable or not, they did not constitute an “artificial surcharge” on rivals’ chips because Qualcomm charged the same royalties whether the OEM used Qualcomm chips or a competitor’s chips.", "In addition, Qualcomm’s royalties were for patents that the OEMs actually used (regardless of the brand of chips purchased) and that therefore had value to the OEMs.", "Furthermore, the appeals court held the FTC’s theory that Qualcomm used its high licensing royalties to enable it to cut its chip prices and squeeze out chip competitors was precluded by the Supreme Court’s rejection of “margin squeeze” theories of liability in Pacific Bell Telephone Co. v. Linkline Communications, Inc.4 In Linkline, the Supreme Court had rejected monopoly claims of margin squeeze asserted against AT&T by its competitors who procured access to AT&T’s telephone lines in order to compete with AT&T in retail sales of internet service.", "Absent evidence that AT&T was guilty of selling below cost at the retail level, the Supreme Court held that AT&T had no antitrust duty to deal with its competitors on the wholesale level and could only be liable for monopolization at the retail level if there was evidence that its retail pricing was below cost.", "The FTC’s case against Qualcomm not only failed to show pricing below cost but was premised on the theory that Qualcomm receives monopoly profits on modem chips.", "Qualcomm’s No License, No Chips policy, the appeals court held, imposed no anticompetitive harm on rival chip producers, since Qualcomm received the same royalty rates for its SEP technology, regardless of whose chips an OEM purchased.", "By definition, the court reasoned, such equal royalty rates for the technology do not distort competition among chip manufacturers.", "The court distinguished this case from a hypothetical case in which Qualcomm would not license its technology unless the OEM purchased Qualcomm’s chips.", "Under the No Chips, No License policy, OEM would either have to use Qualcomm’s chips or pay for both Qualcomm’s and a competitor’s chips.", "But unlike such a policy, the No License, No Chips policy is neutral as to the brand of chips purchased.", "The appeals court concluded that Qualcomm’s contracts affording Apple pricing discounts if they bought exclusively Qualcomm chips did not foreclose a substantial share of the market since a competitive chip producer won a substantial portion of the Apple business the year after the challenged agreement was signed.", "Although exclusive dealing agreements can have anticompetitive effects, they are not per se unlawful.", "Instead, they are unlawful only when they foreclose competition in a substantial share of the markets.", "Pricing discounts conditioned on exclusivity in short term contracts seldom have significant adverse competitive effects.", "Although licensors of SEPs may find solace in the appeal court’s decision that Qualcomm’s licensing practices were not antitrust violations, licensees may take heart from the fact that the court left open the question of whether the same practices could generate liabilities under contract law for a breach of Qualcomm’s FRAND commitments to license all users of its technology on fair, reasonable, and non-discriminatory terms.", "This publication/newsletter is for informational purposes and does not contain or convey legal advice.", "The information herein should not be used or relied upon in regard to any particular facts or circumstances without first consulting a lawyer.", "Any views expressed herein are those of the author(s) and not necessarily those of the law firm's clients."]}

The Ninth Circuit Rejects Refusal to Deal Claims Based on Aspen Skiing", "The Supreme Court's decision in Aspen Skiing17 marks the high water mark of the Supreme Court's acceptance of monopolization claims based on a refusal to assist rivals.", "In Trinko the Court characterized Aspen Skiing as \"at or near the outer boundary of § 2 liability, \" and post-Trinko cases have narrowly cabined antitrust liability based on unilateral refusals to deal.18 The Ninth Circuit's decision continues that trend, refusing to conclude that Qualcomm's alleged commitments to standard-setting organizations changed the refusal to deal analysis.", "Consistent with the post-Trinko case law in the Ninth Circuit and elsewhere, the court held that even monopolists have no general duty to supply their rivals, and that antitrust liability may be imposed only when a monopolist \"unilaterally terminates a voluntary and profitable course of dealing\" and \"the only conceivable rationale or purpose is to sacrifice short-term benefits in order to obtain higher profits in the long run through the exclusion of competition.", "\"19 But the Ninth Circuit's decision also added another prerequisite not usually expressly stated in the post-Trinko cases, that \"the refusal to deal involves products that the defendant already sells in the existing market to other similarly situated customers.\"20", "As noted in MetroNet Services, the Ninth Circuit decision on which the Qualcomm court relied, this prong of the test relates to whether a remedy compelling dealing would be administrable, rather than whether the refusal to deal should be deemed anticompetitive.21 The court found that the FTC's claim failed all three prongs of the test.", "Indeed, while the district court had relied on Aspen, the Ninth Circuit's decision notes that the FTC conceded that the district court's application of Aspen Skiing was erroneous.22 Rather, the FTC asserted that the Aspen/Trinko \"heightened standard for claims challenging a simple refusal to deal has no application where, as here, a monopolist's refusal to license its rivals breaches its own voluntary commitments made to induce SSOs to include its patented technology in industry-wide standards.", "Applying Aspen and Trinko, the Ninth Circuit found that there was no prior course of dealing, and that Qualcomm's direct licensing of chip competitors back in 1999 was irrelevant, because Qualcomm changed its policies before it obtained monopoly power to reflect changes in the law of patent exhaustion.", "Qualcomm's conduct failed to satisfy the second prong of the test because its rationale was not to sacrifice profits for long-term gain, but to make greater current profits in both the short and long term.", "Finally, regarding the administrability prong, the Ninth Circuit found that because Qualcomm applied its policy \"neutrally with respect to all competing modem chip manufacturers, the third Aspen Skiing requirement does not apply.", "B. Harm to Customers That Does Not Foreclose Competitors Is Not an Antitrust Concern, and a Breach of SSO Commitments Is Not Enough, Standing Alone, To Find an Antitrust Violation", "US antitrust law reaches only exclusionary conduct by monopolists. Unlike law in, for example, the European Union, US law does not reach \"exploitative\" conduct in which a monopolist charges high prices or otherwise disadvantages customers, unless that conduct also excludes competitors (as might be the case if only customers that dealt with competitors were targeted for higher prices, or if the competitor is also a customer).", "The Ninth Circuit characterized Qualcomm's \"no license, no chips\" policy as a policy of \"no license, no problem\" as far as rival chipmakers were concerned.25 Even if Qualcomm's policy allowed it to charge supracompetitive royalties to customers in breach of its SSO commitments, the Court held that the FTC had failed to explain how the policy \"impairs the opportunities of rivals,\" because all OEMs paid the same royalty whether they bought chips from Qualcomm or one of its competitors.", "While the FTC argued that the policy discouraged entry and investment by rivals, the Ninth Circuit pointed to a history of entry despite the policy.", "Although the lower court granted summary judgment to the FTC on the issue of whether Qualcomm's licensing approach violated its SSO commitments, the Ninth Circuit held that it did not need to reach that issue and vacated the lower court's interpretation as moot.", "It found that it need not reach the question of whether there was a breach of the SSO commitments because there was no exclusionary effect regardless.", "The Ninth Circuit also distinguished this case from the facts of the Third Circuit's decision in Broadcom Corp. v. Qualcomm.26 In Broadcom, the court found an antitrust violation based on a breach of SSO commitments because Qualcomm's deception induced the SSO to include Qualcomm intellectual property in the standard, which Qualcomm then licensed at \"discriminatorily higher\" royalty rates.", "The Ninth Circuit highlighted the key issue in Broadcom as the intentional false promise to license on FRAND terms and noted that there was no such conduct in the FTC's case because Qualcomm's competitors could practice its patents without paying any royalty at all.27", "The leading appellate decision on the antitrust treatment of a patent holder's standard-setting conduct is the DC Circuit's decision in Rambus.28 In that case the DC Circuit rejected an FTC challenge to Rambus's failure to disclose patents in breach of its commitment to an SSO, holding that the FTC failed to prove that Rambus had unlawfully obtained monopoly power because there was no evidence that the SSO would have chosen to incorporate alternatives to Rambus's patents had there been no deception.", "While the Third Circuit's decision in Broadcom v. Qualcomm predates Rambus and does not condition antitrust liability for deception of an SSO on proof that the deception allowed the IP owner to attain monopoly power, the Third Circuit noted that Broadcom had alleged that absent Qualcomm's conduct the SSO would not have standardized the Qualcomm technology, and \"the allegations of the Complaint foreclose the possibility that [Qualcomm technology's] inclusion in the standard was inevitable.\"", "The Ninth Circuit's decision does not, however, address whether Qualcomm's technology would have been included in the standard even if the FTC had established that Qualcomm had engaged in deception.", "Finally, the Ninth Circuit also noted the \"persuasive policy arguments\" that SSO and FRAND disputes are essentially contract disputes where caution should be taken in applying the antitrust laws.29", "C. Exclusive Dealing Claims Failed for Lack of Foreclosure Effect", "On the issue of Qualcomm's supply agreements with Apple, the Ninth Circuit acknowledged that the lower court's finding of de facto exclusivity had \"some merit,\" highlighting that the volume discounts were contingent on exclusivity and not easily terminable.30 However, the court found that there was a lack of anticompetitive effect.", "According to the Ninth Circuit, Qualcomm had only one \"serious\" competitor during the period when the Apple agreements were in effect.", "That competitor won Apple's business in 2014, the year after Apple's 2013 agreement with Qualcomm, and the court found a lack of evidence that the competitor could have been a viable alternative at the time of Apple's 2011 agreement with Qualcomm.31 The Ninth Circuit also held that the Apple supply agreements could not be the basis for the injunctive relief sought by the FTC, because Apple terminated them in 2015, two years before the FTC filed its complaint.32", "- Earning monopoly profits on patents is not an antitrust violation. The Ninth Circuit characterized Qualcomm as engaged in profit-maximizing, \"hypercompetitive behavior\" and held that just because Qualcomm had \"sharp elbows,\" that did not mean it had acted anticompetitively.33", "The decision is a reminder that high prices or high royalty rates alone—and even rates at a monopoly price—cannot form the basis for an antitrust claim against a monopolist.", "- Patent holders can design royalty systems to avoid patent exhaustion and choose where in the supply chain to extract their royalties.", "The FTC's central contention was that the royalty charged by Qualcomm to OEMs acted as a surcharge on sales by Qualcomm's competitors and allowed Qualcomm to charge lower prices for its own chips.", "The Ninth Circuit, however, made clear that nothing in the antitrust laws prohibited Qualcomm from choosing where in the supply chain it wanted to license and there was no evidence that Qualcomm's chip prices were so low as to be considered predatory.", "The court characterized the FTC's arguments as a type of \"margin squeeze\" theory that was rejected by the Supreme Court in linkLine.34 Even if SSOs clearly draft their patent policies to require IP owners to license component makers, a breach of that commitment does not raise antitrust concerns where component makers pay no royalties and there is no price squeeze.", "- Aspen Skiing applications remain limited. Antitrust liability for unilateral refusals to deal remains disfavored.", "The Ninth Circuit's decision does not even cite its decision in ITS v. Kodak, in which the court held that a refusal to license patents can be the basis for antitrust liability where the justification for the refusal to deal is \"pretextual.", "\"35 Instead, antitrust liability attaches to a unilateral refusal to deal only if there was a prior course of dealing, the refusal involves a \"profit sacrifice\" and lacks any procompetitive justification, and a remedy would be administrable as shown by the fact that the defendant is currently selling to others.", "- Breach of a FRAND commitment does not constitute an antitrust violation unless there is foreclosure (and maybe not even then).", "Because Qualcomm's licensing policies led to its competitors being licensed royalty-free and OEMs paying the same royalty regardless of where they bought their chips—and because there was no price squeeze—even if Qualcomm breached its FRAND obligations that breach did not foreclose competitors.", "- Volume discounts that are contingent on exclusivity risk antitrust claims if foreclosure can be established.", "The Ninth Circuit did take issue with the structure of Qualcomm's supply contracts to Apple given Qualcomm's monopoly power.", "While it found the specific claims here failed because the facts did not establish the requisite foreclosure and the agreements had already been terminated, companies with high market shares considering similar provisions should proceed cautiously and engage in a careful assessment of market conditions before enforcing those provisions.", "© Arnold & Porter Kaye Scholer LLP 2020 All Rights Reserved.

The remarkable speed with which CFIUS advanced this matter to the president, and his correspondingly rapid action blocking the transaction, provides a degree of policy responsiveness that is largely absent across the rest of the U.S. government.", "This case, however, also illustrates CFIUS’ inherent limitations to address broader concerns over domestic capabilities and capacity.", "Much of the justification found in CFIUS’ statements, as well as the argument included in congressional letters concerning the risks of the transaction, would apply equally to a purely domestic acquisition of Qualcomm by a U.S. company.", "Were a U.S. company to acquire Qualcomm with a “private equity-style direction”—as phrased by CFIUS—or purchase Qualcomm with an eye to radically reduce research and development spending, CFIUS would have no recourse.", "Thus, although in this case CFIUS was well-positioned to address perceived concerns, it is clearly insufficient to address the broader set of concerns identified in the December 2017 National Security Strategy and implicated by the United States’ declining technology edge in key areas of national security.", "We believe the Order is reflective of a significant change in CFIUS’ perspective on the national security risk of foreign investment in the United States and the use of CFIUS to advance the economic aspects of the administration’s national security policy.", "Others, however, have a legitimate belief that a variety of specific factors demonstrate that the Order does not represent a radical change for CFIUS.", "For example, Broadcom’s move to redomicile added significant complexity to the CFIUS-related issues and undoubtedly led to a hurried consideration of the substantive outcome of CFIUS’ response.", "In addition, the technology involved has long been central to CFIUS and broader U.S. government concerns, as is in part illustrated by recent White House contemplation of a larger U.S. government role in 5G networks and technology, and Obama-era reports regarding the importance of the semiconductor industry to national security.", "It has also been noted in the media that Qualcomm had a close and long-standing relationship with the U.S. government.", "As 2018 progresses, we will continue to further assess the impact of the president’s action as it relates to, or is reflected in reviews of, other transactions.", "The president’s blocking of the Broadcom/Qualcomm transaction should be seen as part of the Trump administration’s heightened effort to guard against perceived national security concerns emanating from trade.", "Consistent with the December 2017 National Security Strategy and as evidenced by the Order, we expect that CFIUS reviews will increasingly reflect the positions set forth in the president’s policy.", "Consequently, more than ever, cross-border transactions require careful and early-stage diligence and analysis to understand fully how CFIUS may view national security issues.", "1For additional information about administration efforts concerning CFIUS reform, see the Skadden client alerts “Legislation Proposes Sweeping New Foreign Investment Review Authorities” and “Reform Proposes Sweeping Changes to CFIUS Reviews.”(go"]}

The value of SEPs continues to grow in view of emerging Alice case law as well as new U.S. Patent and Trademark Office guidelines providing guidance for patent eligibility.[1] Under this emerging landscape, the development of strong SEPs and diverse SEP portfolios has become even more valuable.", "Qualcomm Inc. displayed this type of diverse SEP portfolio strategy in the widely discussed Federal Trade Commission v. Qualcomm case.[2] As massive judgments and settlements continue to occur in common SEP fields such as wireless communications, the question of whether to declare a patent as essential to a standard is as important as ever.[3]", "But the potential benefits of pursuing an SEP must be balanced with an understanding of the potential consequences that may result.", "In fact, several of these consequences were also highlighted in the recent Qualcomm case where the district court enjoined Qualcomm from continuing various licensing practices relating to its SEPs — finding that its tactics were anti-competitive — and requiring Qualcomm to make exhaustive SEP licenses available to rival chip manufacturers on fair, reasonable and nondiscriminatory terms.", "In view of these considerations, this article will address the top four things to know when seeking to obtain a patent directed toward a standardized technology.", "While a primary focus of drafting an SEP application may be to cover elements essential to a standardized technology, the application itself should also consider how the technology might evolve in the future and what industries are likely to adopt the technology.", "Doing so will help ensure the resulting SEP has the broadest reach and longest usefulness possible.", "When taking these considerations into account, drafters should seek to vary the scope of the claims to target different potential infringers.", "For example, drafting claims to target different infringers along a supply chain, and different levels of implementation of the technology, will aid in variability as well as help guard against unexpected changes in the adoption of the underlying technology.", "For example, if the standardized technology is a communication protocol, drafters could draft claims directed to a method of performing the communication protocol, a specific integrated circuit that uses the protocol, or even an end-user electronic device that uses the protocol.", "As seen from the recent Qualcomm case, Qualcomm also uses this portfolio diversity approach.

For example, drafters should consider whether an invention is a required part or an optional part of the standardized technology.", "Essentiality and infringement may be more difficult to prove when claims are drafted only toward optional features.", "Other considerations include whether the claims allow for infringement to be easily detected, and whether the standardized technology is emerging (and subject to change) — i.e., standards directed toward artificial intelligence, blockchain and 5G — or a legacy technology such as 4G. Each of these considerations must be carefully weighed when seeking to obtain a patent directed toward a standardized technology.", "Different Standards-Setting Organizations Have Different SEP Disclosure Rules", "While pursuing an SEP, a company may also be participating in the development of the standard they are seeking to obtain a patent on.", "Different standards-setting organizations have different rules for participating in the development of a standard and may require the disclosure of patents and applications relevant to the standard.", "If a company wishes to obtain an SEP directed toward a technology governed by such an SSO, the company must understand and adhere to these rules.", "These rules are generally codified in a series of contracts between companies and SSOs — e.g., SSO membership application, intellectual property rights policies, assertion forms and different SSOs may have different contract terms and may be subject to different jurisdictions governing the enforcement of those contracts.", "The IP rights policies for the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers and Internet Engineering Task Force provide good examples to illustrate these points.", "The IEEE is a professional association for electrical and electronic engineering, telecommunications and computer engineering.[7] The IEEE Standards Association is an organization within the IEEE responsible for developing global standards, such as the Wi-Fi standard (IEEE 802.11).[8]", "The IEEE-SA utilizes bylaws that describe the process of adopting a standard.[9]", "First, an IEEE-approved organization must sponsor a standard and provide public notice of the intent to develop a standard.[10]", "At this point, the IEEE-SA expects interested members with IP rights relevant to the proposed standard to come forward and provide a letter of assurance.[11]", "The bylaws indicate that the letter of assurance should be provided prior to the approval of the standard.[12] While the IEEE encourages the disclosure of IP rights that are potentially relevant to a standardized technology, the IEEE does not explicitly provide consequences for lack of disclosure.[13]", "In contrast to the IEEE, the IETF explicitly requires disclosure of potential IP rights if a party wishes to participate in the development of a standard.[14] The IETF maintains standards related to internet architecture and internet communications.", "Contributors to standards and participants in the IETF are required to disclose IP rights that may be relevant to a standard.[15]", "Contributing to or participating in IETF activities related to a standardized technology without making required IP rights disclosures is a violation of IETF policy.[16] A failure to disclose relevant IP rights may result in sanctions from the IETF that may prevent the company from further contributing to or participating in IETF activities.[17]", "While the IETF requires contributors to disclose patents, the IETF does not maintain any positions on applicability to a standard or validity of patents.[18]", "While these types of SSO disclosure requirements have not been challenged legally, the European Commission (the executive branch of the European Union) has recently criticized SSOs for their handling of disclosures.[19]", "The European Commission has acknowledged that SSOs typically maintain databases that collect “large amounts of declaration data” but has criticized SSOs for not providing “user-friendly accessibility to interested parties” and “lack[ing] essential quality features.", "In response to these issues, the European Commission has called on SSOs to update their declaration systems to provide up-to-date information on SEPs.[21]", "The European Commission has suggested disclosing up-to-date ownership or licensor status for an SEP, reporting the main outcomes of “final decisions, positive or negative, on declared SEPs (including on essentiality and patent validity)” and requiring that SEP owners “at least make reference to the section of the standard that is relevant to the SEP and to the link with the patent family.", "In view of these guidelines, SEP owners may face updated disclosure requirements in the near future. The difference in these disclosure requirements highlights the importance of gaining a full and complete understanding of the disclosure requirements put in place by each SSO.", "The Pros and Cons of Declaring Your Patent Essential to a Standard", "However, understanding the disclosure requirements put in place by a particular SSO is only half the battle.", "Next, SEP holders and applicants must then decide whether it is in their best interests to make an affirmative declaration that their patent or application is essential to a standard.", "Here, we address the considerations on both sides and explain several factors to consider when deciding whether to declare a patent or patent application as essential to a standardized technology.", "One of the major benefits of declaring a patent or patent application as essential to a standard is the stronger negotiating position provided during enforcement.", "Owning an asset alleged to be essential to a standardized technology inherently means that any implementers utilizing the standard will be infringing your patent.", "Infringement is easier to prove and designing around the standardized technology will be difficult — assuming the patent is truly essential to the standard.", "Implementers will likely face difficulties using nonstandard technology. Similarly, widely adopted standards will implicate a large number of companies and products.", "In this case, the large number of potential infringers may lead to larger royalties.", "These benefits for SEP holders, and corresponding challenges for SEP implementers, are the driving force behind the recent proliferation of patent pools directed toward SEPs.", "For example, Avanci LLC uses these understood realities of SEPs to bring SEP holders/licensors and SEP implementers/licensees together.", "To date, Avanci has signed up about 30 licensors and about a dozen licensees and procured licensee agreements with several auto manufacturers at a royalty rate of about $15 per vehicle.[23]", "Additionally, if a company participates in the early stages of a standard-setting process, there is a higher likelihood that the specific technology being advocated for by that company eventually becomes adopted as the standard.", "Therefore, the underlying patents and applications owned by that company have a higher likelihood of reading on the ultimately adopted standard.", "And since many SSOs require, or encourage, participating companies to disclose their IP rights (effectively a standard-essential declaration), a company may find that disclosing their patent or application to the SSO and being able to exert its influence on what technology is adopted as the standard is advantageous to not disclosing its patent or application and having no influence on whether the technology that it developed is adopted as the standard.", "On the other hand, a drawback of declaring a patent or patent application as essential to a standard is the loss of some enforcement or licensing rights.", "For example, an explicit condition for declaring a patent as essential is an agreement to license the SEP on fair, reasonable and nondiscriminatory terms.", "Standard-essential declarations may then force companies into licensing their SEPs on acceptable FRAND terms and may further prevent the companies from charging potentially higher royalty rates.", "Similarly, in many cases, injunctive relief becomes more difficult to obtain. For example, the IEEE’s IP rights disclosure requirements include a prohibition against seeking injunctions or exclusion orders against implementers so long as the implementers are not acting or negotiating in bad faith.[24]", "Moreover, the potential consequences can become even more complicated as these FRAND obligations may subject companies to unfavorable contract laws, antitrust issues and unpredictable FRAND decisions.[25]", "As an example of how these drawbacks can play themselves out, we again look to the recent Qualcomm case.", "In that case, the court ruled that Qualcomm’s licensing practices in the markets for code-division multiple access and premium long-term evolution modem chips violated Sections 1 and 2 of the Sherman Act and Section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act, were anti-competitive and harmed consumers.[26]", "The court subsequently enjoined Qualcomm from continuing these practices, stating specifically that: (1) it could no longer condition the supply of modem chips on a customer’s patent license status; (2) it cannot enter into express or de facto exclusive dealing agreements for the supply of modem chips; (3) it must make exhaustive SEP licenses available to rival chip manufacturers on fair, reasonable and nondiscriminatory terms; (4) it cannot interfere with a customer’s ability to communicate with a government agency about potential law enforcement or regulatory matter; and (5) it must submit to compliance and monitoring procedures for seven years.[27]", "Additionally, on the issue of validity, declaring a patent as essential to a standard may provide a guided path to implementers to invalidate the SEP.", "For example, if the SEP is merely directed to an incremental improvement to an existing standard, a challenger may be able to prove that the improvement was obvious.", "Specifically, the challenger may be able to use a combination of a prior standardized technology with SSO working group documents to show the obviousness of the SEP.", "As a result, a company considering whether to declare its patents or patent applications as essential to a standardized technology should carefully consider how closely their claims track the standard, each SSO’s disclosure requirements, and its own short and long term goals for its IP rights.", "Declaring Your Patent as Being Essential to a Standard Is Not a Guarantee", "If a company ultimately decides to declare its intellectual property as essential to a standard, an important detail to keep in mind is that SSOs rarely vet or comment on the applicability of a declared patent to a standard or the validity of the patent in general.", "Further, even if an SSO identifies a patent as potentially being part of a standard, a court could completely disagree.", "Thus, an SSO’s acknowledgment of a patent as being essential to a standard is not a guarantee of enforceability.", "Consider the following example, the IEEE-SA bylaws indicate that patent owners should provide letters of assurance prior to the approval of the standard[28] and expressly state that the IEEE is not responsible for “identifying Essential Patent Claims for which a license may be required,” nor is it responsible for “determining whether any licensing terms or conditions … are reasonable or non-discriminatory.", "”[29] Upon receiving a letter of assurance, a statement indicating that the patent may be applicable to the standard is simply listed on the IEEE-SA website.[30]", "The IETF operates in a similar manner taking “no position regarding the validity or scope of any intellectual property rights or other rights that might be claimed to pertain to the implementation or use of the technology described in any IETF documents … nor does it represent that it has made any independent effort to identify any such rights.", "”[31] Patent owners simply complete a form indicating the type of license they are willing to provide.[32]", "In this manner, declaring to an SSO that a patent is essential to a standard provides no guarantees when trying to enforce the SEP.", "Courts have further explained that the determination of whether a particular patent is essential to a standard is a factual question requiring examination beyond a mere declaration.[33]", "Further, jurisdictions around the world are experimenting with ways to verify whether claims are essential to a standardized technology.", "For example, the previously described European Commission has proposed several approaches including having SSOs confirm essentiality, coordinating with patent offices to perform independent essentiality checks, and establishing an independent European body tasked with essentiality assessments.[34]", "Similar approaches have been recently advocated for by industry players such as Raymond Millien, vice president and global chief intellectual property counsel for Volvo Car Corporation, and Jan Schnitzer, general counsel and head of IP at u-blox AG[35], and commentators such as former USPTO Director David Kappos, and may be adopted in the United States in the near future.", "In this manner, patent owners may be required to prove essentiality under a moving target of laws and procedures.", "Merely relying on the implementation of a standard as being evidence of infringement may be insufficient to enforce a declared, but unproven, SEP.", "While SEPs are enticing assets to pursue as standardized technologies continue to emerge, patent owners should understand several aspects of the process for obtaining SEPs.", "In particular, patent owners should employ best practices for patent drafting to obtain a patent or patent portfolio resilient against invalidity challenges, essentiality challenges, future changes to the underlying standard, and potential design around alternatives.", "Further, patent owners should understand their obligations to SSOs as well as SSO policies regarding patent disclosure and FRAND obligations beyond just a royalty rate.", "Finally, patent owners should also understand that a mere declaration that a patent is essential to a standard may not be sufficient when attempting to enforce an SEP during litigation.", "Each of these considerations should be taken into account when drafting an SEP application — including the level of detail to include in the specification and the appropriate scope to pursue in the claims — when participating in a standard setting process and when determining whether to declare a patent as essential to a standard.", "Ryan Richardson and Michael

It is a common practice of patent holders to calculate royalties on the basis of where the patent is used in a device rather than based on the value of the whole device.", "For example, if a company owns a patent for tires of heavy-duty trucks, it will mostly likely charge a percentage of the value of tires where the patent is used instead of charging a percentage of the entire truck’s value.", "What Qualcomm did, however, was to charge a certain percent of the wholesale price of the entire device.", "For example, if a licensee uses Qualcomm’s patent in producing a cellular chip for iPhone, Qualcomm could calculate the royalty of such patent on the basis of an iPhone’s wholesale price, even though the phone has many other components.", "Despite Qualcomm’s attempt to “vigorously defend” itself,[2] the NDRC found that Qualcomm abused its market-dominant position and that the company’s challenged practices restricted and excluded market competition, hampered innovation and technology development, harmed consumers’ rights and interests, and thus violated Chinese anti-monopoly rules.[1]", "As a consequence, in addition to paying the unprecedented fine, Qualcomm is also required to implement a rectification plan that modifies certain aspects of its business practices in China to fully satisfy the requirements set by the NDRC.", "After a careful reading of the decision and the rectification plan as approved by the Chinese authority, one may find that the punishment imposed is serious yet fairly amicable, as the result could have been worse for Qualcomm.", "First, China’ Anti-monopoly Law allows antitrust regulators to fine up to 10 per cent of the violator’s revenue for the fiscal year preceding the year when the decision is made.", "The amount of the fine actually imposed, however, was calculated based on 8 per cent of Qualcomm’s sales in China in 2013, much less than the maximum amount allowed by the law.", "Second, while the Chinese regulators had the authority to force Qualcomm to license its patent for free, they declined to do so in this case.", "Third, although Qualcomm agreed to cease its most controversial practice of calculating royalties on the full wholesale price of the entire device, it only committed to reducing the calculation base to 65 per cent of the wholesale price of the entire device, instead of reducing it to the price of the smallest saleable patent-practicing unit, which is the common practice in the industry.", "The NDRC later explained to Chinese media that, by fully cooperating during the investigation, Qualcomm deserved the lenient terms.[3]", "According to Qualcomm’s own press release, such terms reflected the Chinese regulator’s “acknowledgment of the value and importance of Qualcomm’s technology and many contributions to China.”[4]", "What is of particular interest in this case is the reported fact that Qualcomm aggressively defended itself against the allegations put forward by the Chinese regulators.", "As a part of its defence strategy in the investigation, Qualcomm hired one of the drafters of the China Anti-monopoly Law, Zhang Xinzhu.", "At the time of drafting, he was an advisor to the Expert Consultation Group of the State Council’s Anti-monopoly Committee, but was later stripped of his position due to an apparent conflict of interest.", "According to Zhang, Qualcomm was the first company putting up a serious defence against the Chinese government.[5]", "Qualcomm ultimately reached a settlement agreement with the Chinese government and committed, as stated in its press release, to “not pursue further legal proceedings contesting the NDRC’s findings.", "”[4] The Chinese regulators attributed this to the high level of transparency and effective communication between themselves and Qualcomm during the entire probe process.", "At the same time, it is also very difficult to turn a blind eye to the fact that half of Qualcomm’s revenue comes from China,[6] a market it cannot afford to lose, especially considering that the Chinese regulator had already made certain concessions when rendering its decision, as discussed above.", "The result of the Qualcomm decision—the amount of the fine combined with NDRC’s willingness to pursue contentious cases—seems to confirm the Chinese authority’s determination to tackle complex anticompetitive practices.", "This is in line with a recent global trend witnessed by the competition law community[7]—an increasing number of emerging market economies are stepping up to establish or reform their competition law regimes.", "For example, Brazil reformed its competition regime in 2012.

on 28 February 2013 by the conclusion of a subsequent agreement (‘the first amendment to the transition agreement’) which entered into force with retroactive effect on 1 January 2013 (together ‘the agreements concerned’).", "28 The Commission pointed out that the agreements concerned provided for incentive payments to be made by the applicant to Apple on condition that Apple source all of its

contested decision, the agreements concerned had come to an end following the release by Apple on 16 September 2016 of iPhone 7 devices incorporating Intel’s LTE chipsets.", "31 In Section 9 of the contested decision, the Commission found that the relevant market was the open market for LTE chipsets and that that market was worldwide in scope (‘the relevant market’).", "In particular, the Commission stated that the relevant market included standalone LTE chipsets and integrated LTE chipsets but excluded captive production of those chipsets.", "In that regard, the Commission took the view, inter alia, that LTE chipsets were not substitutable for chipsets compatible with the GSM standard or for chipsets compatible with the UMTS standard (‘UMTS chipsets’).", "32 In Section 10 of the contested decision, the Commission concluded that the applicant had held a dominant position in the relevant market between 1 January 2011 and 31 December 2016.", "To that end, the Commission stated that the applicant had enjoyed large shares in the relevant market since 2010, that that market was characterised by the existence of a number of barriers to entry and expansion, and that the commercial strength of the applicant’s chipset customers was not capable of adversely affecting its dominant position.", "33 In Section 11 of the contested decision, the Commission concluded that the applicant had abused its dominant position in the relevant market by making the payments concerned.", "To that end, the Commission stated that the payments concerned were exclusivity payments, that those payments were capable of having anticompetitive effects, that the applicant’s critical margin analysis did not affect the Commission’s conclusion and that the applicant had not demonstrated that those payments were counterbalanced or compensated for by advantages in terms of efficiency also benefiting consumers.", "34 The Commission stated that the abuse engaged in by the applicant had taken place during the period concerned.", "35 The Commission found that a fine ought to be imposed on the applicant and, after calculation, decided that the fine ought to be set at EUR 997 439 000.", "36 The operative part of the contested decision reads as follows:", "Qualcomm Inc. has committed an infringement of Article 102 of the Treaty [on the Functioning of the European Union] and Article 54 of

the alternative, annul or reduce substantially the amount of the fine imposed;", "117 The Commission contends that the Court should:", "118 In support of its action, the applicant raises seven pleas in law.", "– the first plea alleges manifest procedural errors;", "– the second plea alleges manifest errors of assessment, failure to state reasons and distortion of evidence relating to efficiencies;", "– the third plea alleges manifest errors of law and of assessment as regards anticompetitive effects;", "– the fourth plea alleges manifest errors of assessment as regards the definition of the relevant market and the existence of a dominant position;", "– the fifth plea alleges manifest errors of law and of assessment and failure to state reasons as regards the duration of the alleged infringement;", "– the sixth plea alleges manifest errors of assessment in applying the Guidelines on the method of setting fines imposed pursuant to Article 23(2)(a) of Regulation No 1/2003 (OJ 2006 C 210, p. 2) and breach of the principle of proportionality;", "– the seventh plea alleges manifest errors of assessment as regards the jurisdiction of the Commission and the effect on trade between Member States.", "119 In the interests of the proper administration of justice, it is appropriate to examine the first and third pleas in the action.", "120 As a preliminary point, it is appropriate to examine the admissibility, which the Commission disputes, of the further evidence of 26 July 2019.", "A. Admissibility of the further evidence of 26 July 2019", "121 As a preliminary point, it should be noted that the further evidence of 26 July 2019 consists, first, in a very large majority, of a set of documents sent by Apple to the applicant between February and June 2019 following proceedings brought by the applicant on 20 August 2018 against Apple before the District Court pursuant to Section 1782 of Title 28 of the United States Code, entitled ‘Assistance to foreign and international tribunals and to litigants before such tribunals’ (‘the 1782 proceedings’) and, second, in a small part, of a set of documents from proceedings brought by the Federal Trade Commission (Federal competition agency, United States) against the applicant before the District Court and which resulted, in the context of a public hearing which commenced on 4 January 2019, in the judgment of 21 May 2019 mentioned in paragraph 54 above (‘the FTC proceedings’) being adopted.", "Furthermore, that additional evidence also includes, to a limited extent, certain press articles.", "122 As a further preliminary point, it should also be recalled that, before the hearing, the applicant sent the Court a list of the documents submitted in respect of the further evidence of 26 July 2019 stemming from the 1782 proceedings, in respect of which confidentiality had been totally or partially waived (see paragraph 113 above) and that, during the public part of the hearing, the applicant referred to certain of those documents and to the existence of the 1782 proceedings.", "123 The applicant states that those documents were not available to it or its European lawyers at the time of lodging the application or the reply and that it lodged the submission providing the further evidence of 26 July 2019 as soon as possible.", "First, as regards the documents from the 1782 proceedings, the applicant states that, following an order of February 2019, Apple sent 2 300 documents to it between 23 February and 24 June 2019 in nine separate deliveries and that its lawyers examined those documents and identified those documents to be provided to the Court.", "Second, as regards the documents from the FTC proceedings, the applicant explains that a protective order prohibited its US lawyers from transmitting the documents concerned to its European lawyers.", "124 The Commission contends that the further evidence of 26 July 2019 is inadmissible. First, it submits that certain documents pre-date the application, such as certain press articles, emails between the applicant and Apple and presentations by the applicant.", "Second, the Commission states that the applicant has not explained why, first, it failed to apply for disclosure of the documents before the District Court before 20 August 2018, in particular before the contested decision was adopted or immediately afterwards and why, second, it failed to inform the Court of that application or of its status in the reply.", "Third, the Commission submits that the applicant has provided no explanation as to why it did not make an earlier request to Apple to grant permission to use the evidence from the FTC proceedings, in particular before the hearing which took place in January 2019.", "Fourth, the Commission states that Article 92(7) of the Rules of Procedure concerns evidence provided in response to measures of inquiry and does not entitle a main party to submit, of its own motion and without adequate justification, additional evidence.", "Fifth, the Commission maintains that the applicant merely refers to certain additional evidence without providing any explanation of the matters addressed or demonstrating how that evidence supports its arguments.", "125 In the first place, it should be noted that the applicant, in support of providing the further evidence of 26 July 2019, first, relies on Article 85(3) of the Rules of Procedure and, second, states that that evidence is produced in the light of Article 92(7) of those rules.", "126 The Commission contends that the conditions laid down by Article 85(3) of the Rules of Procedure are not satisfied and that Article 92(7) of those rules is, in essence, irrelevant.", "127 First, it should be pointed out that Article 85(3) of the Rules of Procedure provides that ‘the main parties may, exceptionally, produce or offer further evidence before the oral part of the procedure is closed or before the decision of the General Court to rule without an oral part of the procedure, provided that the delay in the submission of such evidence is justified’.", "In particular, that possibility is an exception to the general rule set out in paragraph 1 of that article that evidence produced or offered must be submitted in the first exchange of pleadings.", "128 It follows from the wording of that provision that, in order to rely on that possibility, the delay in adducing evidence must be justified by exceptional circumstances (see, to that effect, judgment of 11 September 2019, HX v Council, C‑540/18 P, not published, EU:C:2019:707, paragraph 67).", "129 Accordingly, the Court allows the lodging of evidence offered after the rejoinder only in exceptional circumstances, that is, if the person offering the evidence was unable, before the end of the written procedure, to obtain possession of the evidence in question (see judgment of 12 September 2019, Achemos Grupė and Achema v Commission, T‑417/16 P, not published, EU:C:2019:597, paragraph 37 and the case-law cited).", "The exceptional nature of such a submission implies that producing such evidence earlier was impossible or could not reasonably be required (see, to that effect, judgment of 15 December 2016, TestBioTech and Others v Commission, T‑177/13, not published, EU:T:2016:736, paragraph 251).", "130 Furthermore, in that regard, it must be pointed out that the exception provided for in Article 85(3) of the Rules of Procedure differs from that provided for in Article 85(2), which allows the main parties to produce evidence in the reply or rejoinder in support of their arguments provided that the delay is justified, the latter exception not requiring there to be exceptional circumstances.", "131 Second, it must be observed that, as regards measures of inquiry, under Article 92(7) of the Rules of Procedure, ‘evidence may be submitted in rebuttal and previous evidence may be amplified’.", "132 In the present case, the applicant does not rely, as such, on that latter provision, but relies on it in so far as the case-law considers that Article 85 of the Rules of Procedure must be interpreted in the light of Article 92(7) of those rules, which provides that evidence may be submitted in rebuttal and previous evidence may be amplified (judgments of 22 June 2017, Biogena Naturprodukte v EUIPO (ZUM wohl), T‑236/16, EU:T:2017:416, paragraph 17, and of 9 September 2020, Greece v Commission, T‑46/19, not published, EU:", "133 In the present case, as is apparent from the submission accompanying the further evidence of 26 July 2019, that evidence was produced in support of the first, second, third and fourth pleas in the action.", "Although the applicant states, in general terms, that that evidence is produced in order to amplify the evidence adduced in support of the arguments put forward in the application and in the reply and in order to refute the Commission’s arguments set out in the contested decision, in the defence and in the rejoinder, it must be stated that that evidence is not specifically either evidence in rebuttal intended to refute evidence produced by the Commission, or evidence seeking to amplify previous evidence, but is rather new evidence intended to support certain of the pleas in the action.", "134 It is therefore necessary to examine whether, in the present case, the production of the further evidence of 26 July 2019 was justified by exceptional circumstances, in accordance with Article 85(3) of the Rules of Procedure.", "135 In that regard, in the second place, it is necessary to examine the Commission’s objections seeking to demonstrate that the requirements laid down in Article 85(3) of the Rules of Procedure have not been satisfied.", "136 First, as regards the documents from the 1782 proceedings, as a preliminary point, it should be recalled that those documents form part of a set of documents sent by Apple to the applicant between 23 February and 24 June 2019 at the end of the 1782 proceedings.", "In other words, it is common ground that the applicant received those documents, in a number of deliveries, after the reply had been lodged on 4 January 2019.", "It must therefore be stated that the applicant did not have the documents in question when it lodged its main pleadings and could therefore not produce them in the context of those pleadings, but that it was able to obtain them only at the end of the 1782 proceedings.", "137 On the one hand, however, the Commission objects that the applicant has provided no explanation why it had not brought the 1782 proceedings against Apple before the District Court earlier.", "138 However, the Commission’s objection is of no relevance for the assessment of whether there are exceptional circumstances as provided for in Article 85(3) of the Rules of Procedure.", "The question which arises in that regard is whether or not the evidence concerned was available at the stage of the lodging of the application or of lodging of the reply (see, to that effect, judgment of 13 December 2018, Haeberlen v ENISA, T‑632/16, not published, EU:T:2018:957, paragraphs 184 and 185) and not whether, as a matter of speculation, the applicant could have taken steps which, hypothetically, would have enabled it to make use of that evidence earlier.", "139 In any event, it must be stated that that objection is based on incorrect premisses.", "140 The 1782 proceedings brought by the applicant against Apple before the District Court were intended to gather evidence making it possible to refute certain findings of the Commission in the contested decision in view of the present judicial proceedings.", "The applicant was therefore not in a position to bring the 1782 proceedings before the contested decision was adopted and, moreover, even if that were possible, was under no obligation to do so as a precautionary and speculative measure in view of possible litigation before that decision had even been adopted.", "141 The applicant cannot therefore be criticised for not having brought the proceedings in question before the contested decision was adopted.", "142 In addition, in so far as the Commission relies on the fact that the applicant could have brought those proceedings ‘in the days and weeks following the adoption of the [d]ecision on 24 January 2018’, it must be stated that such an argument is also speculative and, moreover, amounts to imposing an obligation on the applicant which is unreasonable, or even impossible to satisfy.", "On the contrary, it is justified for the applicant, following the adoption of the contested decision, to have first prepared and brought the present action on 6 April 2018 and then, in the light of the content of the contested decision and of that action, to have brought the 1782 proceedings in order to obtain further evidence in support of its action.", "The Commission’s approach also disregards the inevitable period of coordination between the applicant, its European representatives and its US representatives in order to initiate the 1782 proceedings in the United States for the purposes of the present proceedings.", "Moreover, since, at the end of the 1782 proceedings, the applicant received the documents from Apple over a period of 6 to 10 months after those proceedings commenced, even if, as the Commission argues, it would have been possible to bring such proceedings when it was preparing its application (between February and March 2018), the applicant would, in all likelihood, not have received all the documents in time to examine them and produce them in the application on 6 April 2018 or in the reply on 4 January 2019.", "143 On the other hand, the Commission contends that the applicant did not inform the Court of the existence and status of the action which it had brought before the District Court, in particular in the reply.", "That objection by the Commission is, however, also irrelevant, since Article 85(3) of the Rules of Procedure in no way requires the Court to be given prior information.", "144 Second, as regards the set of documents originating from the FTC proceedings, as a preliminary point, it must be stated that those documents form part of the case file of the FTC proceedings before the District Court and that, before the public hearing commenced before that District Court in January 2019, knowledge and use of those documents were restricted by a protective order of 24 October 2017.", "145 Those matters are common ground between the parties, just as it is common ground that, on the date of lodging the reply on 4 January 2019, those documents were not freely available to the applicant, since, first, knowledge and use of them was restricted to a limited number of the applicant’s American lawyers and in-house lawyers, those persons having been unable to send them to the applicant’s European lawyers, or to use them for the purposes of the administrative proceedings which led to the adoption of the contested decision or for the purposes of the present legal proceedings, and second, the public hearing before the District Court which made those documents public was held from 4 to 29 January 2019.", "146 The Commission, however, submits that, under certain provisions of the protective order of 24 October 2017, without waiting for the public hearing held in January 2019 to begin, the applicant could have asked Apple for authorisation to allow it to use those documents earlier in the context of the present proceedings.", "147 That objection by the Commission also cannot be accepted, since it is based on pure conjecture which cannot serve as a basis for the review by the Court.", "As the Commission itself points out, even if the applicant’s American lawyers and in-house lawyers with access to those documents had been in a position to assess their usefulness for the present proceedings, any use for that purpose required Apple’s prior agreement.", "There is nothing to indicate that, in the circumstances of the present case, those two eventualities would have become reality.", "148 In any event, it should be noted that, as has been pointed out in paragraph 138 above, the question which arises is whether or not the evidence concerned was available at the stage of the lodging of the application or of the reply.", "In view of the evidence referred to in paragraph 145 above, that was not the situation in the present case, since the applicant lodged its reply on 4 January 2019, that is to say, the very day on which the extended time limit for lodging that document expired, and since the public hearing in the FTC proceedings, under which the documents at issue became public, also began on 4 January 2019.", "Consequently, it must be held that the applicant could not produce the documents at issue at the point when the reply was lodged.", "149 Moreover, it cannot be held that, in the circumstances of the present case, the applicant unduly delayed producing before the Court the documents from the FTC proceedings.", "Since, in January 2019, the 1782 proceedings remained pending and the applicant received the documents from those proceedings between the end of February and the end of June 2019, it was justified for it to examine as a whole and then to produce together in July 2019 the relevant documents from both sets of proceedings.", "150 Third, as regards the documents mentioned by the Commission which, although originating from the 1782 proceedings or the FTC proceedings, were available to the applicant before the application in the present case was lodged, that is to say emails between it and Apple and presentations by the applicant, it must be stated that it is true that those documents were available to the applicant on a document-by-document basis.", "However, those documents form part of the set of documents sent by Apple to the applicant at the end of the 1782 proceedings or of the set of documents constituting the case file in the FTC proceedings in the context of the January 2019 public hearing, with the result that they cannot be considered in isolation from the other documents in those sets.", "Accordingly, the applicant and its lawyers could not necessarily assess their relevance to the present case independently of the other documents in those document sets.", "In other words, in view of its origin, the further evidence of 26 July 2019 cannot be artificially segmented but, in so far as it stems from the 1782 proceedings or from the FTC proceedings, its admissibility must be assessed as regards the documents as a whole.", "151 Fourth, the same is true of the three press articles included in the further evidence of 26 July 2019 which had been published before the application was lodged, since their late production is justified by the production of other additional evidence which they seek to support in footnotes to the pleading producing that evidence.", "152 Fifth, as regards the Commission’s general allegation that, in the submission which produced the further evidence of 26 July 2019, the applicant does no more than make simple references to that evidence without providing explanations, that circumstance is irrelevant in relation to the assessment required by Article 85(3) of the Rules of Procedure, but relates, where appropriate, to the intelligibility of that evidence in examining the substance of the pleas in the action.", "153 In the light of all the foregoing, in the circumstances of the present case, it must be concluded that the production, as a whole, of the further evidence of 26 July 2019 after the end of the written part of the procedure is justified by exceptional circumstances and that that evidence must therefore be admitted under Article 85(3) of the Rules of Procedure.", "154 The first plea in law comprises four parts. The first alleges infringement of the rights of the defence in that the applicant was deprived of the opportunity to comment on important aspects of the contested decision.", "The second alleges breach of the principle of sound administration in that the Commission failed to conduct a thorough, objective and diligent investigation.", "The third alleges infringement of the rights of the defence in that the Commission failed to disclose to the applicant evidence relevant to its defence.", "The fourth alleges breach of the obligation to state reasons and breach of the principle of sound administration in that the Commission’s assessment of the facts was inaccurate, biased and incomplete.", "155 It is appropriate to examine the first and third parts, alleging infringement of the rights of the defence.", "156 The rights of the defence are fundamental rights forming an integral part of the general principles of law whose observance the General Court and the Court of Justice ensure (see, to that effect, judgment of 25 October 2011, Solvay v Commission (C‑109/10 P, EU:C:2011:686, paragraph 52).", "157 Observance of the rights of the defence is a general principle of EU law which applies where the authorities are minded to adopt a measure which will adversely affect an individual (judgment of 16 January 2019, Commission v United Parcel Service, C‑265/17 P, EU:C:2019:23, paragraph 28).", "158 That general principle of EU law is enshrined in Article 41(2)(a) and (b) of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union (judgment of 25 March 2021, Deutsche Telekom v Commission, C‑152/19 P, EU:C:2021:238, paragraph 105).", "159 In the context of competition law, observance of the rights of the defence means that any addressee of a decision finding that that addressee has committed an infringement of the competition rules must have been afforded the opportunity, during the administrative procedure, to make known its views on the truth and relevance of the facts and circumstances alleged as well as on the documents used by the Commission to support its claim that there has been such an infringement (judgments of 25 October 2011, Solvay v Commission, C‑109/10 P, EU:C:2011:686, paragraph 53, and of 25 March 2021, Deutsche Telekom v Commission, C‑152/19 P, EU:C:2021:238, paragraph 106).", "160 According to well-established case-law, the rights of the defence are infringed where it is possible that the outcome of the administrative procedure conducted by the Commission may have been different as a result of an error committed by it.", "An applicant undertaking establishes that there has been such infringement where it adequately demonstrates not that the Commission’s decision would have been different in content, but rather that it would have been better able to ensure its defence had there been no procedural error (judgments of 2 October 2003, Thyssen Stahl v Commission, C‑194/99 P, EU:C:2003:527, paragraph 31, and of 13 December 2018, Deutsche Telekom v Commission, T‑827/14, EU:T:2018:930, paragraph 129).", "161 Such an assessment must be made in the light of the factual and legal circumstances of each case (judgment of 18 June 2020, Commission v RQ, C‑831/18 P, EU:C:2020:481, paragraph 107).", "2. The third part of the first plea: infringement of the rights of the defence, in so far as it relates to the absence of notes and information concerning meetings and conference calls with third parties", "162 The third part is based on two complaints. The first alleges that the Commission failed to provide the applicant with adequate access to the case file.", "The second alleges that the case file lacks notes and information concerning the content of the Commission’s meetings and conference calls with third parties.", "163 It is appropriate to examine the second complaint.", "164 The applicant argues that the Commission is required to take notes of its formal or informal meetings with third parties and that it must forward those notes to the parties under investigation.", "In the present case, the Commission provided the applicant with no notes of its meetings with third parties.", "After the contested decision had been adopted, following a request from the applicant, the Commission informed the applicant that meetings and conference calls with third parties had taken place and forwarded to it notes which were meaningless.", "More complete notes would have assisted the applicant’s defence in a number of respects. In addition, the Commission refused to reveal whether it had met with a particular third party during the investigation, whereas it is of relevance to the applicant’s defence to know whether such meetings took place and which topics had been discussed.", "165 The applicant adds that Regulation No 1/2003 draws no distinction between interviews and other types of meetings or conference calls.", "In the view of the applicant, the Commission is not entitled to determine, at a meeting or a conference call, what is exculpatory and what is not; rather it is for the undertaking concerned to decide whether specific elements from the case file may be helpful for the purposes of its defence.", "In the present case, the notes forwarded by the Commission to the applicant are not appropriate, as they do not contain any meaningful information on the content of the discussions or on the nature of the information provided on the topics referred to, but rather identical and vague expressions.", "The applicant denies that it was able to determine the information exchanged at the meeting and in the conference calls in question on the basis of the third parties’ replies to the information requests, since the notes make no reference to those replies, and vice versa.", "The applicant states that it is not for the Commission to determine whether or not a third party has provided exculpatory information, since the Commission is under an obligation to take notes and provide them to it.", "166 First, the Commission, after stating that it took appropriate notes of the meetings and conference calls with third parties, replies that it is under no general duty to take notes during meetings or conference calls with third parties, its obligations being more limited.", "The Commission states, on the one hand, that it is required to take ‘full notes’ of meetings or conference calls which constitute interviews within the meaning of Article 19(1) of Regulation", "No 1/2003, the purpose of which is to collect information relating to an investigation, although the applicant has not submitted in the present case that meetings or conference calls with third parties constituted ‘interviews’.", "On the other hand, the Commission is required to take ‘succinct notes’ of meetings or conference calls the purpose of which is to collect information relating to an investigation only where third parties provide inculpatory evidence which the Commission intends to use or exculpatory evidence on which the undertaking could rely.", "Second, the Commission submits that it properly took ‘succinct notes’ of the meetings and conference calls in question.", "It states that, in the present case, following the request by the applicant, it found that it had inadvertently failed to provide the applicant with the notes of a meeting and of three conference calls with third parties, but that it had then provided the applicant with those notes, stating the undertakings, timing and topics addressed.", "Similarly, the Commission states that the contested decision does not rely on any incriminatory evidence provided by those third parties during those meetings and conference calls.", "Third, the Commission maintains that the applicant has not demonstrated why it would be relevant to its defence to know whether it had met with a particular third party, in so far as the decision is based on evidence provided by Apple and it is difficult to imagine the applicant asserting that the third party in question was likely to provide exculpatory evidence.", "167 The Commission adds that the applicant does not take account of the fact that the third party who had had a meeting with it did not provide exculpatory evidence and that third parties who had held conference calls with it stated that they had not discussed matters which were not contained in the information provided in their replies to the information requests.", "According to the Commission, it is plausible that certain information provided during those conference calls was already contained in the replies to the information requests, just as it is plausible that the information subsequently provided in the replies to the information requests reflects the content of the conference calls, which is logical.", "The Commission maintains that the applicant’s argument that the meeting and the conference calls in question are interviews within the meaning of Article 19 of Regulation", "No 1/2003 is out of time and inadmissible. Furthermore, the Commission states that the applicant does not explain why the information on meetings with a third party is relevant.", "168 From the outset, in the present case, it is common ground that, during the administrative procedure which led to the adoption of the contested decision, the Commission did not forward to the applicant any information concerning either the existence or content of the meetings and conference calls which it had held with third parties.", "169 However, the Commission provided the applicant with certain information concerning seven meetings or conference calls with third parties after the contested decision had been adopted.", "More specifically, information concerning four of them was provided, following a request by the applicant, before the present action was brought, whilst information on the other three was provided during the present proceedings, either in response to the applicant’s arguments based on the further evidence of 26 July 2019 or in response to the measures of inquiry ordered by the Court on 12 October 2020.", "170 It is therefore necessary to examine whether, in those circumstances, the Commission infringed the applicant’s rights of defence.", "(a) The meeting and conference calls with third parties in respect of which information was sent to the applicant before the present action was brought", "171 It is apparent from the evidence submitted that, after receiving the contested decision, the applicant asked the Commission on 25 January 2018 to inform it of meetings or interviews which the Commission had held with third parties and of which it had not been informed.", "On 2 March 2018 the Commission informed the applicant by email that it had verified whether it had inadvertently failed to inform it of ‘any meeting or interview’ which had taken place ‘in the context of Case AT.40220’.", "In that regard, the Commission informed the applicant that it had inadvertently failed to inform it of the existence of a meeting and three conference calls with third parties.", "By the same email, the Commission sent the applicant documents containing the notes of that meeting and of those conference calls as well as a presentation made at that meeting.", "172 More specifically, the Commission referred to a meeting with [confidential] (1) on [confidential], a conference call with [confidential] on [confidential] and two conference calls on [confidential], one with [confidential] and the other with [confidential].", "173 In that regard, first, it must be observed that that meeting and those conference calls took place before the statement of objections and after the first information requests referred to in paragraphs 6 and 15 above had been sent.", "It is common ground, indeed, that that meeting and those conference calls took place, as the Commission stated, ‘in the context of Case AT.40220’.", "Second, as is apparent from the contested decision, those third parties are two competitors and two customers of the applicant, who also replied to some of those information requests.", "174 [confidential] is a competitor of the applicant. As is apparent from the contested decision, that competitor [confidential].", "In addition, according to the contested decision, [confidential].", "175 [confidential] is a competitor of the applicant. As is apparent from the contested decision, it is, with [confidential], one of the [confidential] competitors that [confidential].", "176 Moreover, [confidential] and [confidential] are [confidential].", "177 [confidential] is an OEM obtaining supplies of LTE chipsets and [confidential].", "178 [confidential] is an OEM obtaining supplies of LTE chipsets [confidential].", "179 The applicant submits, in essence, that the Commission failed to fulfil its obligations to take notes of that meeting and those conference calls and to forward them to it.", "In particular, the applicant states that the notes which the Commission sent to it after the contested decision had been adopted are not appropriate and are meaningless.", "180 The Commission submits, as a preliminary point, that the applicant did not maintain in the application that the meeting and the conference calls in question constituted ‘interviews’ within the meaning of Article 19 of Regulation", "No 1/2003 and that, therefore, the argument put forward in the reply alleging that that provision was infringed is inadmissible.", "In any event, the Commission submits, in essence, that the meeting and the conference calls in question did not constitute interviews within the meaning of Article 19 of Regulation", "No 1/2003 as they were not intended to gather information relating to the subject matter of an investigation.", "It was not therefore required to take full notes of that meeting and of those conference calls, but solely succinct notes in so far as the third parties provided inculpatory evidence which the Commission intended to use or provided exculpatory evidence on which the undertaking could have relied.", "181 As regards the admissibility of the applicant’s argument, it is true that the applicant did not expressly refer to Article 19 of Regulation", "No 1/2003 in the application. However, it submitted expressly that the Commission had infringed the obligation to keep notes, or to take appropriate notes, of that meeting and of those conference calls and relied, for that purpose, on paragraph 91 of the judgment of 6 September 2017, Intel v Commission (C‑413/14 P, EU:C:2017:632), which concerns specifically the obligations arising from Article 19 of Regulation", "No 1/2003. Therefore, the argument put forward by the applicant in the application sought clearly to argue that the Commission had infringed its obligations under that provision and the case-law relating to it.", "Therefore, the Commission’s plea of inadmissibility must be rejected.", "182 As regards the substance of the applicant’s argument, it must be recalled that Article 19(1) of Regulation", "No 1/2003 constitutes a legal basis empowering the Commission to interview a natural or legal person in the context of an investigation (judgment of 6 September 2017, Intel v Commission, C‑413/14 P, EU:C:2017:632, paragraph 86).", "183 It is apparent from the very wording of Article 19(1) of Regulation No 1/2003 that that provision is intended to apply to any interview conducted for the purpose of collecting information relating to the subject matter of an investigation.", "There is nothing in the wording of that provision or in the objective it pursues to suggest that the legislature intended to exclude certain of those interviews from the scope of that provision (judgment of 6 September 2017, Intel v Commission, C‑413/14 P, EU:C:2017:632, paragraphs 84 and 87).", "184 As is apparent from the preparatory documents for Regulation No 1/2003, that legal basis refers to the simple fact of hearing a natural or legal person in order to gather information (see the Proposal for a Council Regulation on the implementation of the rules on competition laid down in Articles 81 and 82 [EC] and amending Regulations (EEC) No 1017/68, (EEC) No 2988/74, (EEC) No 4056/86 and (EEC)", "No 3975/87 (COM(2000) 582 final) (OJ 2000 C 365 E, p. 284)).", "185 Therefore, the fact that the interviews which the Commission held with third parties may have taken the form of meetings or conference calls cannot bring them outside the scope of Article 19 of Regulation", "No 1/2003, when they are conducted for the purposes of collecting information relating to the subject matter of an investigation.", "186 In the present case, contrary to the Commission’s suggestion, a body of consistent evidence demonstrates that the purpose of the meeting and the conference calls in question was to collect information relating to the subject matter of the investigation which led to the adoption of the contested decision.", "187 First, from a procedural perspective, the meeting and the conference calls in question were held after the Commission had commenced the investigation in August 2014 (recital 8 of the contested decision) and, in particular, after the first information requests referred to in paragraphs 6 and 15 above had been sent.", "Furthermore, the notes drafted by the Commission all refer to the administrative procedure which led to the adoption of the contested decision, namely ‘AT.40220’.", "In addition, the exchanges which the Commission had with the applicant when it forwarded those notes to it (paragraph 171 above) bear that same reference and refer expressly to ‘meetings or interviews which had taken place in the context of Case AT.40220’.", "188 Second, from a substantive perspective, those notes all indicate that the meeting and the conference calls in question concerned the chipsets market, the applicant’s position on that market or certain of the applicant’s business practices on that market.", "More specifically, the note of the meeting with [confidential] of [confidential] states that it concerned the chipsets market and the applicant’s position on that market; the note of the conference call with [confidential] of [confidential] indicates that it concerned certain business practices of the applicant in the chipsets sector and that no concrete evidence was provided during the conference call; the note of the conference call with [confidential] of [confidential] indicates that it concerned the chipsets market and certain business practices of the applicant; and the note of the conference call with [confidential] of [confidential] indicates that it concerned the chipsets market.", "189 Since the meeting with [confidential] and the conference calls with [confidential], [confidential] and [confidential] were conducted for the purposes of collecting information relating to the subject matter of the investigation, as regards the relevant market, the applicant’s position on that market or the applicant’s business practices on that market, they fell within the scope of Article 19 of Regulation", "190 When it conducts an interview, pursuant to Article 19 of Regulation No 1/2003, for the purposes of collecting information relating to the subject matter of an investigation, the Commission is required to record such an interview in a form of its choosing.", "For that purpose, it is not sufficient for the Commission to make a brief summary of the subjects addressed during the interview.", "The Commission must be in a position to provide an indication of the content of the discussions which took place during the interview, in particular the nature of the information provided during the interview on the subjects addressed (see, to that effect, judgment of 6 September 2017, Intel v Commission, C‑413/14 P, EU:C:2017:632, paragraphs 91 and 92).", "191 In the present case, the notes sent by the Commission to the applicant after the contested decision had been adopted do no more than provide, in addition to the date and names of the participants, a very general indication – limited, in essence, to two to three lines – concerning the subjects addressed, namely the chipsets market, the applicant’s position on that market or the applicant’s business practices on that market.", "By contrast, those notes give no indication of the content of the discussions held during the interviews, in particular regarding the nature of the information provided on the subjects addressed, as required by the case-law referred to in paragraph 190 above.", "192 Furthermore, the fact that those notes are incomplete is illustrated with clarity by two circumstances highlighted by the applicant.", "193 First, the note concerning the conference call with [confidential] states that that third party provided its ‘views’ on ‘certain business practices of [the applicant] in the area of baseband chipsets’ and that no ‘concrete evidence’ was provided.", "As the applicant correctly points out, such a note raises questions as to the content of the discussions which took place between the Commission and the third party, the information which that third party provided and the absence of ‘evidence’ – moreover ‘concrete’ evidence – concerning that information.", "Such a note does not therefore make it possible to understand the information which [confidential] communicated to the Commission without providing concrete evidence and thus leaves the applicant unable to know what evidence was discussed during that conference call and, in particular, the possibility that that third party, namely [confidential], might have mentioned inculpatory or even exculpatory evidence, without providing any concrete evidence.", "194 Second, the note relating to the meeting with [confidential] states that that meeting concerned the chipsets market and the applicant’s position on that market.", "Apart from the fact that such a description does not make it possible to understand the information which [confidential] forwarded to the Commission in that regard, it must be stated that that note does not mention that, at that meeting, that third party gave an oral presentation nor, a fortiori, the content of that presentation.", "A copy of that presentation was, however, forwarded by the Commission to the applicant after the contested decision was adopted, on 2 March 2018, in response to the applicant’s request of 25 January 2018.", "It is apparent from that 10-page presentation that it concerned specifically the investigation which led to the adoption of the contested decision (as is apparent from the cover page of that presentation, which mentioned the name and number of those proceedings), and that one page was devoted to the applicant’s dominant position on the chipsets market and five pages were devoted to [confidential].", "The absence of any reference to such a presentation or to its content in the note drawn up by the Commission demonstrates its lack of precision.", "195 Moreover, in addition to being incomplete, while the evidence submitted indicates that the documents containing those notes were drawn up by the Commission on the dates of the conference calls or shortly after the date of the meeting respectively, they also show that those notes were not complete on those dates and that they were supplemented or finalised subsequently, after the contested decision had been adopted.", "After being requested by the applicant on 25 January 2018 and therefore approximately three years after the date of those interviews, first, the Commission contacted [confidential] to obtain a copy of the presentation made by that third party at the meeting and, second, contacted [confidential],", "[confidential] and [confidential] to confirm the content of the notes which it had prepared of the conference calls,", "[confidential] having even proposed amendments to the note, which were accepted by the Commission. It is, for that matter, apparent from the evidence submitted that the clarification that ‘no concrete evidence was produced during the [conference] call’ did not appear in an initial version of the note and that it was added following that exchange between the Commission and [confidential].", "196 It follows that, contrary to Article 19 of Regulation No 1/2003, the Commission did not properly record the interviews it held with [confidential], [confidential], [confidential] and [confidential].", "197 Moreover, in so far as the applicant also argues that the Commission failed to send to it the notes of the interviews in question, first, it must be observed that, as the Commission explained before the Court, the note of the meeting with [confidential] had been recorded in the case file on [confidential] as a non-accessible document, that is to say as an internal Commission document, and without a copy of the presentation made by [confidential] at that meeting.", "Second, the notes of the conference calls with [confidential], [confidential] and [confidential] had not been registered in the case file.", "198 Whatever the reasons for that, it is therefore common ground that the applicant received no information on the existence and scope of those interviews during the administrative procedure which led to the adoption of the contested decision.", "Nor are those interviews mentioned in the description of the administrative procedure contained in the contested decision.", "199 In that regard, suffice it to note that, while it is indeed permissible to preclude from the administrative procedure evidence which has no relation to the allegations of fact and of law in the statement of objections and which therefore has no relevance to the investigation, it cannot be for the Commission alone to determine the evidence of use in the defence of the undertaking concerned (judgments of 7 January 2004, Aalborg Portland and Others v Commission, C‑204/00 P, C‑205/00 P, C‑211/00 P, C‑213/00 P, C‑217/00 P and C‑219/00 P, EU:C:2004:6, paragraph 126, and of 16 June 2011, FMC Foret v Commission, T‑191/06, EU:T:2011:277, paragraph 306).", "From that point of view, it must be observed that the record of interviews conducted for the purposes of collecting information on the subject matter of the investigation, which therefore falls within the scope of Article 19 of Regulation No 1/2003, such as the interviews in question, cannot be omitted from the case file.", "200 While the Commission argues that the failure to communicate that information or those notes to the applicant had occurred ‘inadvertently’ and that it sent that information as soon as it had become aware of it after the applicant’s request of 25 January 2018, such circumstances, subsequent to the adoption of the contested decision, are not capable of remedying the procedural error committed by the Commission.", "First, the notes forwarded by the Commission to the applicant, in view of their incompleteness, do not remedy the failure to make a record in accordance with Article 19 of Regulation", "No 1/2003, since they do not indicate the information gathered during the interviews in question. Second, it must be pointed out that belated disclosure, after the adoption of a decision, of certain material which ought to have been included in the case file does not necessarily return the undertaking to the situation it would have been in if it had been able to rely on that material in presenting its written and oral observations to the Commission (see, to that effect, judgment of 25 October 2011, Solvay v Commission, C‑109/10 P, EU:C:2011:686, paragraph 56).", "201 It follows from all the foregoing that, as regards the meeting with [confidential] and conference calls with [confidential],", "[confidential] and [confidential], the Commission failed to fulfil the obligations to make a record arising under Article 19 of Regulation No 1/2003 and, consequently, to include a record of those interviews in the case file.", "202 As regards the inferences to be drawn from the finding made in paragraph 201 above, in accordance with the case-law referred to in paragraphs 160 and 161 above, it is necessary to establish whether, in the light of the specific factual and legal circumstances of the present case, the applicant has demonstrated adequately that it would have been better able to ensure its defence had there been no procedural error.", "203 It is appropriate to start by stating that, in view of the identity of the third parties in question, the content of the notes produced by the Commission and the content of the contested decision, the applicant highlighted that those third parties might have provided information which could have helped its defence, in particular as regards relevant market definition, market power and dominant position, foreclosure effects and efficiencies.", "To that end, the applicant produced before the Court an annex to the application (Annex A.9.7) which was intended to clarify the issues which might have been discussed during those interviews and how that material could have assisted its defence.", "The Commission, while initially disputing the admissibility of that annex, contested its content in an annex to the defence (Annex B.5).", "The parties then continued their exchanges on that subject in an annex to the reply (Annex C.12) and an annex to the rejoinder (Annex D.9).", "204 In the first place, it should be recalled that the contested decision criticises the applicant for having reduced, through its exclusivity payments, Apple’s incentives to switch to competitors on the LTE chipsets market (Sections 11.4.1 and 11.4.2 of the contested decision).", "In that regard, in the contested decision, the Commission refers expressly to [confidential] and also mentions [confidential].", "205 Accordingly, the third parties heard by the Commission in the interviews in question were two competitors of the applicant who were allegedly foreclosed by the applicant’s conduct ([confidential] and [confidential]) and two OEMs who obtained supplies of LTE chipsets, that is to say, competitors of the applicant’s customer who received the payments concerned ([confidential] and [confidential]).", "206 In the second place, on the one hand, it is common ground that the applicant – like the Court – has no precise indication regarding the information gathered by the Commission during the interviews in question, even though those interviews concerned the subject matter of the investigation which led to the adoption of the contested decision and that, as has just been stated, the third parties in question included the applicant’s competitors, who were allegedly foreclosed by the applicant’s conduct, including, in particular, [confidential], namely [confidential].", "207 Indeed, none of the documents in the case file concerning those interviews makes it possible to reconstitute with certainty the precise information relating to the subject matter of the investigation provided by the third parties in question during those interviews or the extent to which their content could have constituted exculpatory, inculpatory or neutral evidence.", "208 In that regard, as concerns the conference calls with [confidential], [confidential] and [confidential], it is a matter of speculation to argue, as the Commission does, that it is ‘plausible’ that the information provided by those third parties was comparable to that provided in their replies to certain information requests and that the information therefore did not include any potentially exculpatory material.", "First of all, the notes of the interviews in question contain no reference to any other document, including the replies given to information requests.", "Their content cannot therefore be reconstituted from other sources in the case file. Next, the fact that those third parties, approximately three years after those interviews had been held and after the contested decision had been adopted, confirmed to the Commission by email, following its request and in order to respond to the applicant’s request of 25 January 2018, that the content of those discussions ‘[was] reflected’ in their replies to certain information requests does not allow any definite conclusion to be drawn as to the content of those discussions, in particular as to the precise nature of the information provided on the subjects addressed.", "209 As regards the meeting with [confidential], contrary to the Commission’s suggestions, the presentation made by that third party at that meeting in no way precludes issues other than those mentioned in that presentation from having been discussed, since that presentation is not mentioned in the note of the meeting and, only one page of that presentation deals with the subjects mentioned in that note.", "In any event, even if the presentation by [confidential] could be regarded as providing an exhaustive reflection of the content of that meeting and as making it possible to rule out the possibility that that third party might have provided information relevant to the applicant’s defence, that would not affect the findings made in respect of the interviews with [confidential], [confidential] and [confidential].", "210 On the other hand, however, in view of the circumstances referred to in paragraphs 204 and 205 above, several elements submitted by the applicant aim to provide prima facie evidence to support its argument that the information which the Commission and [confidential], [confidential], [confidential] and [confidential] might have exchanged during the interviews in question would have made it better able to ensure its defence.", "211 First of all, as is apparent from the notes and the presentation produced by the applicant, it is common ground that those interviews all concerned, in the context of the investigation which led to the adoption of the contested decision, the chipsets market, the applicant’s position on that market or the applicant’s business practices on that market.", "In particular, it is very clear from the notes of two of those interviews, namely from the interview with [confidential] and from the interview with [confidential], that the applicant’s business practices were discussed by the Commission and those third parties.", "Although the notes of the two other interviews do not refer to the applicant’s business practices, it is hardly credible that, during the interview with [confidential] on the same day as the interview with [confidential], the Commission did not seek to obtain information regarding the applicant’s business practices covered by its investigation also from one of the competitors who was allegedly foreclosed.", "In addition, as is apparent from the presentation forwarded by the Commission to the applicant, the meeting with [confidential] also concerned the applicant’s business practices on the chipsets market.", "Even if that third party had provided information concerning [confidential], it is equally not credible that the Commission did not seek to obtain information on the applicant’s practices covered by its investigation.", "212 Therefore, in such circumstances, as the applicant argues, it must be held that the information obtained by the Commission from those third parties during the interviews in question, and particularly from the competitors who were allegedly foreclosed, might have been relevant for its defence.", "213 Next, for the sake of completeness, it should be stated that, in the tables contained in Annex A.9.7, having regard to the content of the contested decision and the specific circumstances of the present case, the applicant highlighted the fact that the Commission could have discussed certain specific issues with the third parties in question.", "214 In that regard, as a preliminary point, it must be observed that, contrary to what the Commission maintains, Annex A.9.7 to the application submitted by the applicant cannot be regarded as being inadmissible.", "It seeks to substantiate in a schematic form, via tables, the arguments put forward in the application in relation to each of the interviews in question by reference to the content of each note.", "Moreover, the breadth of the exchanges which took place in that regard between the parties, contained in tables produced in Annex B.5 to the defence, in Annex C.12 to the reply and in Annex D.9 to the rejoinder, comprising many pages, demonstrates the appropriateness of such tables being set out in the annexes and not reproduced in the body of the main pleadings.", "215 In the present case, the clarifications provided by the applicant relate to certain issues which it regards as relevant for its defence.", "216 First, the applicant argued that the conference call with [confidential] might have concerned, inter alia, the capacity of [confidential] to supply Apple with LTE chipsets for iPhones and iPads during the period concerned, the reasons for and relevance of the lack of competing standalone LTE chipsets from [confidential], the nature and extent of the investments necessary to meet Apple’s requirements and the related contractual protection and [confidential], as well as the possibility that [confidential] had no objections to the agreements concerned or had no complaint [confidential] which would have been exculpatory.", "According to the applicant, in so far as, according to the contested decision, [confidential] was [confidential], any information provided by [confidential] would have been of obvious relevance to the applicant’s defence.", "217 Second, the applicant argued that the conference call with [confidential] might have related, inter alia, to the relative merits of its LTE chipsets and those of [confidential] and [confidential], Apple’s demands vis-à-vis its potential suppliers, the nature and extent of the specific investments necessary for Apple and related contractual protection and market dynamics and the reasons for [confidential].", "According to the applicant, in so far as, according to the contested decision, [confidential] LTE chipsets had been regarded by Apple as potential competitive alternatives to the applicant’s chipsets for certain iPad models, any indication provided by [confidential] would have been of obvious relevance to the applicant’s defence.", "218 Third, the applicant argued that the meeting with [confidential] and the conference call with [confidential] might have related in particular to Apple’s requirements vis-à-vis its suppliers in relation to those of other OEMs and to the relative merits of its chipsets and those of its competitors.", "219 In order to disprove the applicant’s arguments, the Commission stated, in Annex B.5 to the defence, that [confidential]’s replies to the information requests of [confidential] and [confidential] confirm that a note of the conference call with [confidential] would have disclosed no exculpatory evidence regarding the issues mentioned by the applicant, on the ground that, in those replies, [confidential] provided no information relating to those matters.", "The Commission put forward an identical line of argument as regards the issues raised by the applicant in relation to [confidential], by relying on that third party’s replies to the information requests of [confidential] and [confidential], as regards issues mentioned by the applicant in relation to [confidential], by relying on the presentation made by that third party at the meeting in question, and as regards issues raised by the applicant in relation to [confidential], by relying on that third party’s replies to the information requests of [confidential] and [confidential] and of [confidential].", "220 At the outset, in so far as the Commission refers to the replies of [confidential], [confidential] and [confidential] to the information requests and to the presentation by [confidential] for the purposes of maintaining that those third parties did not make reference to exculpatory evidence, it is sufficient to state that such arguments must be rejected for the reasons referred to in paragraphs 208 and 209 above.", "221 However, contrary to the Commission’s suggestions, in the specific circumstances of the present case, the clarifications provided by the applicant in an annex to the application tend to demonstrate in concrete terms that the interviews which the Commission held with the third parties in question could have related to matters such as those referred to in paragraphs 216 to 218 above, which, depending on the circumstances, could have helped the applicant to defend itself better with regard, in particular, to the effects of and justification for its conduct on the LTE chipsets market.", "222 Last, and for the sake of further completeness, as the Commission states, it should be observed that, in Sections 11.4.1 and 11.4.2 of the contested decision, in addition to the information provided by the applicant itself, the Commission referred solely to information and documents from Apple.", "By contrast, in those sections of the contested decision, the Commission did not refer to any evidence provided by [confidential],", "[confidential], [confidential] and [confidential], and in particular by the competitors who were allegedly foreclosed by the applicant.", "Information provided by some of those third parties ([confidential], [confidential] and [confidential]) is mentioned only in Section 11.4.4 of the contested decision (recitals 475, 476 and 478) in order to support the argument of Apple being an ‘attractive customer’.", "223 However, such an observation, in the specific circumstances of the present case, far from precluding an adverse effect on the applicant’s rights of defence, tends to demonstrate that, as the applicant in essence submits, knowledge of the content of the interviews in question could have proved relevant for its defence.", "Knowledge of the fact that those third parties, and in particular the applicant’s competitors who were allegedly foreclosed by the applicant’s conduct ([confidential] and [confidential]), had not provided any inculpatory evidence capable of supporting the foreclosure effect alleged by the Commission when they were heard in the administrative procedure which led to the adoption of the contested decision could have enabled the applicant to present its conduct in a different light and to substantiate its defence differently.", "224 It follows from all the foregoing that, having regard to the specific factual and legal circumstances of the present case, in so far as (i) the Commission did not properly make a record of the interviews in question, and (ii) the applicant or its representatives received no information on the very existence of those interviews until after the contested decision had been adopted and before the present action was brought, the Commission infringed the applicant’s rights of defence.", "The evidence submitted by the applicant tends to demonstrate that the interviews with [confidential] and [confidential], namely two competitors of the applicant who were allegedly foreclosed, and with [confidential] and [confidential], namely two OEMs who obtained supplies of LTE chipsets, could have provided information essential to the further course of the proceedings which could have been relevant to the applicant, by making it better able to ensure its defence.", "225 In the light of that infringement of the applicant’s rights of defence, the third part of the first plea in the action must be upheld in so far as it concerns the meeting with [confidential] and the conference calls with [confidential], [confidential] and [confidential] in respect of which information was provided to the applicant before the present action was brought.", "226 In the circumstances of the present case, it is appropriate to continue the examination of the present part of the plea as regards the meeting and conference call with a third party in respect of which information was provided to the applicant during the present proceedings in response to arguments based on the further evidence of 26 July 2019.", "(b) The conference call and the meeting with a third party in respect of which information was sent to the applicant during the present proceedings in response to arguments based on the further evidence of 26 July 2019", "227 It is apparent from the evidence submitted that, following the Commission’s reply of 2 March 2018 sending the applicant, by email of 5 March 2018, information on the existence of the meeting with [confidential] and the conference calls with [confidential], [confidential] and [confidential], the applicant asked the Commission to confirm that it had not met formally or informally with [confidential].", "By email of 13 March 2018, the Commission reiterated that, following the applicant’s request of 25 January 2018, it had checked whether it had inadvertently failed to inform it of ‘any meeting or interview’ which had taken place ‘in the context of Case AT.40220’ and that it had provided the applicant with information in that regard in its email of 2 March 2018 for reasons of good administration.", "The Commission added that, since the contested decision had been adopted, it would no longer address requests of that type.", "228 The responses which the Commission gave to the applicant on 2 and 13 March 2018 could suggest that the information provided in relation to the meetings or conference calls with third parties was exhaustive and that, therefore, the Commission had not held meetings or conference calls with [confidential], but solely with [confidential],", "229 In the application, however, the applicant submitted that it had no express indication confirming or denying the existence and scope of any meetings or conference calls between the Commission and [confidential].", "230 The Commission did not confirm or deny either in the defence or in the rejoinder whether such meetings or conference calls had been held.", "231 It was only after the applicant had adduced the further evidence of 26 July 2019 that the Commission, in its comments of 30 October 2019 on that evidence, referred to there having been a conference call with [confidential] on [confidential] and a meeting with [confidential] on [confidential], and expressly stated that it had no notes or records of that conference call or that meeting.", "232 As the Commission had, however, stated that it was prepared to provide further information regarding the context of the conference call with [confidential] of [confidential] in the context of measures of inquiry, the Court adopted such measures aimed at obtaining that information.", "The handling of the Commission’s response to those measures of inquiry gave rise to the procedural steps set out in paragraphs 78 to 92 above.", "233 In that regard, first, it must be noted that the conference call and the meeting with [confidential] took place before the statement of objections and after the first information requests referred to in paragraph 15 above had been sent.", "Second, as is apparent from the contested decision, that third party [confidential], and replied to some of those information requests.", "234 However, [confidential] has a particular position in the context of the contested decision. Indeed, a number of factors demonstrate that third party’s importance in the logic of the contested decision: [confidential].", "Furthermore, from a procedural point of view, that third party [confidential].", "235 The arguments put forward by the applicant seek to maintain that the Commission failed to fulfil its obligations to make the applicant aware of that conference call and of that meeting and to make notes of them.", "236 The Commission, when the existence of that conference call and meeting had not yet been confirmed (at the stage of the defence and the rejoinder), argued that the applicant had not demonstrated the relevance of such information.", "Subsequently, after having admitted that they had been held (at the stage of comments on the further evidence of 26 July 2019), the Commission submitted, first, that the applicant had not demonstrated that the regrettable absence of notes of the conference call of [confidential] had been to its detriment and, second, that the meeting of [confidential] concerned general matters rather than Case AT.40220.", "237 At the outset, as regards the notes of the conference call and the meeting in question, it is common ground, as the Commission acknowledged in its comments on the further evidence of 26 July 2019, that it took no note of either the conference call of [confidential] or the meeting of [confidential].", "The Commission also acknowledges that the absence of notes of the conference call of [confidential] is a regrettable failure on its part.", "238 In any event, in so far as the Commission’s arguments ought to be understood as suggesting that the conference call and the meeting in question were not subject to the obligations to make a record arising from Article 19(1) of Regulation No 1/2003 upon which the applicant relies in the application, it is sufficient to state that it is apparent from the evidence submitted that both the conference call of [confidential] and the meeting of [confidential] – in addition to the fact that they were held after the Commission had commenced the investigation in August 2014 (recital 8 of the contested decision) and, in particular, after the first information requests referred to in paragraph 15 above had been sent – were intended to collect information relating to the subject matter of the investigation which led to the adoption of the contested decision.", "239 As regards, first, the conference call with [confidential] of [confidential], the non-confidential version of the document containing an electronic diary entry concerning that conference call, adduced by the Commission on 26 April 2021 in response to the measure of inquiry of 12 October 2020, refers in the subject field to the name of the administrative procedure which led to the adoption of the contested decision, that is to say ‘Sapphire’.", "In addition, in its comments on the further evidence of 26 July 2019 and in the non-confidential version of the document of 19 November 2020, the Commission itself explained that that conference call was intended to gather information on market definition and on the dynamics of the market concerned by that procedure, in order to obtain a basic overview of that market and to prepare relevant questions to be included in the information requests.", "It follows that that conference call was intended to collect information relating to the subject matter of the investigation which led to the adoption of the contested decision.", "240 As regards, second, the meeting with [confidential] of [confidential], the Commission stated that it was intended to cover general issues of competition law and the applicant’s patent practices.", "The exchange of emails concerning the organisation of that meeting adduced by the Commission in response to the measures of organisation of procedure of 8 October 2020 does confirm that [confidential] had requested that that meeting be held in order to discuss ‘current competition and [intellectual property] issues’.", "However, that information in no way precludes the possibility that the subject matter of the investigation which led to the adoption of the contested decision could have been discussed.", "The Commission itself explained that, at that meeting, [confidential] maintained that some of the applicant’s intellectual property practices ought to have been included in the scope of that investigation.", "Consequently, in so far as the scope of the investigation which led to the adoption of the contested decision was expressly mentioned by the third party in order to broaden it, it must be held that that meeting also concerned, wholly or in part, information relating to the subject matter of that investigation.", "241 Furthermore, that latter finding is supported by the further evidence of 26 July 2019.", "242 An initial presentation by [confidential] of [confidential] concerning the applicant and preceding the meeting of [confidential], adduced by the applicant as part of the further evidence of 26 July 2019, states expressly that [confidential] envisaged having a meeting with the Commission the week of [confidential] regarding the Commission’s investigations of the applicant concerning, first, ‘loyalty rebates’, namely the incentives offered to customers to purchase exclusively the applicant’s chipsets, and, second, [confidential].", "That presentation also stated, with regard to those ‘loyalty rebates’, that [confidential] and raised the question [confidential].", "In addition, that presentation contained a page concerning [confidential], stating that [confidential].", "243 A second presentation by [confidential] of [confidential] concerning the applicant and following the meeting of [confidential], adduced by the applicant as part of the further evidence of 26 July 2019, first, gave an update on the Commission’s investigation, noting that the statement of objections was imminent and that the Commission had met the applicant on [confidential], that that investigation concerned loyalty rebates and exclusivity provisions, that it was [confidential] and that it was [confidential].", "Second, after describing [confidential], that presentation stated that there were a number of [confidential], namely [confidential], according to which [confidential], and that a significant fine of around USD 1 thousand million was likely.", "244 Those presentations by [confidential] which preceded and followed the meeting which that third party had with the Commission on [confidential] clearly support the finding that, at that meeting, the Commission and that third party discussed information relating to the subject matter of the investigation which led to the adoption of the contested decision.", "245 Since the conference call and the meeting with [confidential] were intended to collect information relating to the subject matter of the investigation which led to the adoption of the contested decision, as regards, inter alia, market dynamics, the scope of the investigation, and even some of the applicant’s arguments in defence, they fell within the scope of Article 19 of Regulation", "246 In the present case, as has been pointed out in paragraph 237 above, it is common ground that the Commission did not make any form of record of the interviews in question.", "247 Furthermore, such a failure is difficult to reconcile with the documents adduced by the applicant in the context of the further evidence of 26 July 2019, which disclose that, for its part, the third party which met with the Commission had first prepared and then ensured internal follow-up of the meeting of [confidential] (see paragraphs 242 and 243 above), which supports its importance in the investigation which led to the adoption of the contested decision.", "248 It follows that, in breach of Article 19 of Regulation No 1/2003, the Commission did not properly record the interviews which it had conducted with [confidential].", "249 Moreover, in so far as the applicant also claims that the Commission failed to inform it of the interviews in question, it must be recalled that, during the administrative procedure which led to the adoption of the contested decision, the Commission did not actually refer to the interviews which it had held with [confidential].", "As is apparent from paragraph 199 above, the Commission cannot fail to include in the case file a record of interviews such as those which it had conducted with [confidential].", "250 Furthermore, that infringement cannot be remedied by the mere fact that the Commission provided certain information regarding the interviews it had conducted with [confidential] in the course of the present proceedings.", "The examination undertaken by the Court is limited to review of the pleas in law put forward, it has neither the object nor the effect of replacing a full investigation of the case in the context of an administrative procedure (see, to that effect, judgment of 25 October 2011, Solvay v Commission (C‑109/10 P, EU:C:2011:686, paragraph 56).", "Furthermore, first, in the present proceedings, the Commission has produced no record indicating the information gathered during the interviews in question.", "Second, as is apparent from the case-law referred to in paragraph 200 above, belated disclosure of certain materials which ought to have been included in the case file does not return the undertaking, which has brought an action against a Commission decision, to the situation it would have been in if it had been able to rely on that material in presenting its written and oral observations to that institution.", "251 It follows from all the foregoing that, as regards the conference call and the meeting with [confidential], the Commission failed to fulfil its obligations to make a record under Article 19 of Regulation No 1/2003 and, therefore, to include a record of those interviews in the case file.", "252 As regards the inferences to be drawn from the finding made in paragraph 251 above, in accordance with the case-law referred to in paragraphs 160 and 161 above, it is necessary to establish whether, in the light of the specific factual and legal circumstances of the present case, the applicant has demonstrated adequately that it would have been better able to ensure its defence had there been no procedural errors.", "253 To that end, it should be noted first of all that, given the identity of that third party and the content of the contested decision, the applicant stated that it would be of obvious relevance to its defence to know what was discussed between the Commission and that third party.", "In particular, the applicant emphasised that appropriate notes of those interviews would have assisted it in relation to various aspects of its defence, and provided further details in that regard in Annex A.9.7 to the application.", "According to the applicant, the fact that that third party was hostile to it does not rule out the possibility that it might have provided information relevant to the applicant’s defence, either because that information might have been exculpatory or because it might have been inculpatory information which was incomplete or incorrect.", "254 In the first place, it should be recalled that the contested decision criticises the applicant for having reduced Apple’s incentives to switch to competitors on the LTE chipsets market (paragraph 204 above).", "255 Accordingly, the third party heard by the Commission in the context of the two interviews in question [confidential].", "Furthermore, from a procedural point of view, that third party [confidential].", "256 In the second place, on the one hand, it is common ground that the applicant – like the Court – has no precise indication regarding the information gathered by the Commission during the interviews in question, even though those interviews concerned the subject matter of the investigation which led to the adoption of the contested decision and that, as has just been stated, the third party in question [confidential].", "257 None of the documents in the case file concerning those interviews makes it possible to reconstitute with certainty the information relating to the subject matter of the investigation provided by the third party in question during those interviews or the extent to which their content could have constituted exculpatory evidence, inculpatory or neutral evidence.", "258 In that regard, the Commission’s arguments – that, as regards the conference call of [confidential], first, it is not ‘plausible’ that [confidential] could have provided exculpatory evidence and, second, that it is ‘plausible’ that the subjects addressed during that conference call would be found in [confidential]’s replies to the information requests – are purely speculative, since the Commission relies on pure assumptions and was not in a position to set out precisely the content of the information provided by [confidential] during that interview.", "259 Nor can there be any success for the Commission’s argument that the applicant did not ask the Court to hear the [confidential] employees who participated in that conference call, and did not contact those employees directly in order to confirm whether they had provided exculpatory evidence.", "Apart from the fact that the applicant became aware of the materiality of that conference call only at a very late stage in the present proceedings and that, moreover, the Commission did not specify the identity of the employees or representatives of [confidential] who participated in that call, it should be noted that, in any event, it is not for the applicant – nor, for that matter, for the Court – to conduct interviews with a third party (or with its employees or representatives) who has been heard by the Commission in the course of an investigation with the aim of establishing, after the event, the information which was provided to the Commission in order to compensate for the Commission’s failure to make a record, since it is for the Commission to comply with the obligations arising from Article 19 of Regulation", "No 1/2003. Moreover, in the present case, the applicant – like the Court – has no document capable of reconstituting the information provided by the third party in question, unlike the situation referred to in paragraphs 99 to 101 of the judgment of 6 September 2017, Intel v Commission (C‑413/14 P, EU:C:2017:632), upon which the Commission relies, which was characterised by the fact that, in that case, the applicant undertaking had obtained, during the administrative procedure, the non-confidential version of an internal note drawn up by the Commission in relation to the interview at issue and a follow-up document containing written responses to oral questions put during that interview.", "260 On the other hand, however, in view of the circumstances referred to in paragraphs 254 and 255 above, a number of elements submitted by the applicant tend to provide prima facie evidence to support its argument that the information which the Commission and [confidential] could have exchanged during the interviews in question could have made it better able to ensure its defence.", "261 First of all, as the applicant stated in the document producing the further evidence of 26 July 2019, knowledge of the information provided by [confidential] on market definition during the conference call on [confidential] could have been relevant to its defence.", "As noted in paragraph 239 above, the Commission itself explained that that conference call was intended to clarify basic concepts of market definition and market dynamics to enable relevant questions to be included in the second round of information requests.", "It follows that [confidential], at an early stage in the proceedings, contributed to clarifying basic concepts underlying the questions asked by the Commission in the information requests which were subsequently sent to the applicant, its competitors and its customers, without it having been possible to establish the information actually provided in that regard and without the applicant having had an opportunity to comment on the basic concepts which [confidential] contributed to clarifying.", "262 Next, in the document adducing the further evidence of 26 July 2019, the applicant argued, in essence, that the Commission and [confidential] had discussed certain confidential aspects of the investigation, concerning [confidential].", "In its observations on the further evidence of 26 July 2019, the Commission indicated that it had not disclosed confidential information to [confidential], particularly as regards [confidential] mentioned in the second presentation by [confidential] of [confidential] (see paragraph 243 above).", "However, irrespective even of the confidentiality of such information, it must be observed that, in so far as, during the interview of [confidential] which predated that presentation, the Commission and [confidential] discussed [confidential], knowledge of the information gathered by the Commission during such discussions could have made the applicant better able to ensure its defence.", "263 Last, in Annex A.9.7 to the application, the applicant stated that the notes relating to interviews which the Commission might have conducted with [confidential] could have assisted its defence in order, first, to demonstrate that the agreements concerned did not foreclose equally efficient competitors and generated pro-competitive efficiencies and, second, to obtain additional information regarding the Commission’s finding that, in the absence of the agreements concerned, [confidential].", "264 In that regard, as a preliminary point, to the extent that the Commission’s arguments seek to challenge the admissibility of that annex in so far as concerns interviews with [confidential], such arguments cannot be accepted.", "Apart from the fact that the annex in question is intended to support the arguments made in the application (paragraphs 214 and 253 above), it must be recalled, as regards the interviews with [confidential], that, at the stage of the application, the applicant had no information regarding their existence.", "Accordingly, in the specific circumstances of the present case, the applicant cannot be criticised for having provided such details in the annex to the application supporting its arguments concerning meetings and conference calls with third parties.", "265 As the applicant therefore submits in that annex, given the identity of the third party in question and the content of the contested decision, the Commission, during the interviews in question, could actually have obtained information relevant to its defence, concerning the relative merits of its chipsets and those of its competitors, Apple’s requirements compared with the requirements of other OEMs or even Apple’s ability to source from its competitors for all or some of its models.", "Furthermore, in recital 322 of the contested decision, the Commission made the finding, without providing any details or references, that Apple had no technical alternative to the applicant in relation to its LTE chipset requirements for iPhones between 2011 and 2015.", "266 It follows from all the foregoing that, having regard to the specific factual and legal circumstances of the present case, in so far as (i) the Commission did not draw up notes of the interviews in question and (ii) the applicant or its representatives received no information regarding whether those interviews even took place other than in the course of the present proceedings in response to the arguments based on the further evidence of 26 July 2019, the Commission infringed the applicant’s rights of defence.", "The evidence submitted by the applicant tends to demonstrate that the interviews with [confidential], that is [confidential], could have provided information essential to the further course of the proceedings which could have been relevant to the applicant, by making it better able to ensure its defence.", "267 In the light of that infringement of the applicant’s rights of defence, the third part of the first plea in the action must be upheld in so far as it relates to the conference call and the meeting with [confidential], in respect of which information was communicated to the applicant in the course of the present proceedings in response to arguments based on the further evidence of 26 July 2019.", "268 In the circumstances of the present case, it is appropriate to continue the examination of the present part of the plea also as regards the meeting with a third party in respect of which information was communicated to the applicant in the course of the present proceedings in response to the measures of inquiry of 12 October 2020.", "(c) The meeting with a third party in respect of which information was communicated to the applicant in the course of the present proceedings in response to the measures of inquiry of 12 October 2020", "269 It is apparent from the evidence submitted that, in response to the measures of inquiry of 12 October 2020 seeking to obtain further information on the context of the conference call with [confidential] of [confidential], the Commission, in the confidential version of the document of 19 November 2020, referred to a meeting with a third-party informant who had requested anonymity, such meeting having been organised at the request of that third party and having taken place before the Commission commenced the investigation referred to in paragraph 5 above and, in particular, before the information requests referred to in paragraphs 6 and 15 above were sent.", "270 The Commission also adduced before the Court an electronic diary entry recording the date of that meeting and two internal emails, having, in essence, identical content concerning that meeting (‘the internal emails’).", "271 It must be recalled that the confidential version of the document of 19 November 2020 was brought to the attention of the applicant’s representatives, subject to having first given a confidentiality undertaking, including vis-à-vis the applicant, whilst a non-confidential version of the document of 19 November 2020, adduced by the Commission on 26 April 2021, was brought to the attention of the applicant.", "272 After those documents had been lodged, the applicant, through its representatives who had signed the confidentiality undertaking, submitted, in essence, that the Commission was required to take notes of the meeting in question and to provide them to it, in accordance with the judgment of 6 September 2017, Intel v Commission (C‑413/14 P, EU:C:2017:632), in order not to prejudice the rights of defence of the undertaking under investigation.", "In the present case, however, the Commission failed to maintain a record of the meeting in question, although its obligation to take notes and to provide them to the undertaking concerned was well established.", "The applicant, through its representatives who had signed the confidentiality undertaking, stated that the right of access to the file formed part of the fundamental procedural rights and the guarantees necessary for the proper exercise of its rights of defence and that, in the present case, it had suffered harm arising from the fact that the Commission had failed to take notes of the meeting in question and had disclosed its existence only before the Court.", "273 The Commission replied that the obligation to make a record laid down in Article 19 of Regulation No 1/2003 did not apply to that meeting.", "274 As a preliminary point, it is apparent from the evidence submitted and it is common ground between the parties that, in the course of the administrative procedure which led to the adoption of the contested decision, the Commission did not inform the applicant or its representatives of the existence or, a fortiori, of the content of that meeting.", "It is also common ground that neither the electronic diary entry in respect of the date of the meeting nor the internal emails adduced by the Commission before the Court were recorded in the case file.", "275 The Commission, however, argued at the hearing that the meeting with the third-party informant took place before the Commission adopted its first investigative act and that, therefore, it was not subject to the obligations to make a record laid down in Article 19 of Regulation", "No 1/2003, as confirmed by the judgments of 5 October 2020, Casino, Guichard-Perrachon and AMC v Commission (T‑249/17, under appeal, EU:T:2020:458), and of 5 October 2020, Les Mousquetaires and ITM Entreprises v Commission (T‑255/17, under appeal, EU:T:2020:460).", "276 First, it is true, as the Commission stated at the hearing, that it is apparent from the case-law of the Court referred to in paragraph 275 above that the obligation to make a record laid down in Article 19 of Regulation", "No 1/2003 does not apply to interviews prior to the first investigative act (see, to that effect, judgment of 5 October 2020, Casino, Guichard-Perrachon and AMC v Commission, T‑249/17, under appeal, EU:T:2020:458, paragraphs 193 and 195).", "277 Second, however, irrespective of Article 19 of Regulation No 1/2003, it must be recalled that, as the applicant points out by relying on (i) an obligation on the Commission to provide it with the notes which it ought to have taken at that meeting and (ii) the importance of the right of access to the file for the exercise of its rights of defence (see paragraph 272 above), the Commission is required to comply with the obligations incumbent on it as regards the right of access to the case file (see, by analogy, judgments of 25 October 2005, Groupe Danone v Commission, T‑38/02, EU:T:2005:367, paragraph 67, and of 5 October 2020, HeidelbergCement and Schwenk Zement v Commission, T‑380/17, EU:T:2020:471, paragraph 652 (not published)), such right being a corollary of the principle of respect for the rights of the defence (judgment of 7 January 2004, Aalborg Portland and Others v Commission, C‑204/00 P, C‑205/00 P, C‑211/00 P, C‑213/00 P, C‑217/00 P and C‑219/00 P, EU:C:2004:6, paragraph 68).", "278 In that regard, it should be recalled that the right of access to the file in competition cases is intended to enable the addressees of statements of objections to acquaint themselves with the evidence in the Commission’s file so that, on the basis of that evidence, they can express their views effectively on the conclusions reached by the Commission in its statement of objections (judgment of 30 September 2003, Atlantic Container Line and Others v Commission, T‑191/98 and T‑212/98 to T‑214/98, EU:T:2003:245, paragraph 334).", "279 In particular, it follows from those obligations that if the Commission intends to use in its decision inculpatory evidence provided orally by a third-party informant or complainant, it must make it available to the undertakings to which the statement of objections is addressed, where necessary, by creating a written document to be placed in the file.", "The practice of using information provided orally by third parties cannot be permitted to infringe the rights of the defence (see, to that effect, judgments of 30 September 2003, Atlantic Container Line and Others v Commission, T‑191/98 and T‑212/98 to T‑214/98, EU:T:2003:245, paragraph 352; of 25 October 2005, Groupe Danone v Commission, T‑38/02, EU:T:2005:367, paragraph 67; and of 5 October 2020, HeidelbergCement and Schwenk Zement v Commission, T‑380/17, EU:T:2020:471, paragraph 652 (not published)).", "280 Furthermore, the Commission itself, in the context of the present proceedings, argued that, irrespective of Article 19 of Regulation No 1/2003, it was under an obligation, in accordance with the case-law referred to in paragraph 279 above, to take ‘succinct notes’ of meetings with third parties when they provided inculpatory evidence which the Commission intended to use (see paragraph 166 above).", "281 That was so in the present case as regards the meeting with the third-party informant. It is apparent from the internal emails adduced by the Commission before the Court that the third-party informant made allegations against the applicant which, in essence, concurred with the Commission’s theory found at the end of the administrative procedure which led to the adoption of the contested decision, as set out in the title of Section 11.4.1 and in the wording of recital 412 of that decision, stating that ‘[the applicant’s] exclusivity payments reduced Apple’s incentives to switch to competing LTE chipset suppliers’.", "282 However, in the present case, the Commission did not make a record, even a succinct one, in any document nor in any other medium of the material which the third-party informant might have provided in relation to its allegations or even the answers to questions which the Commission might have asked it in that regard.", "Moreover, the internal e-mails also do not refer to such evidence.", "283 It follows that the Commission failed to fulfil its obligations by making no reference to the meeting which it had held with the third-party informant and by failing to include in the case file a written document making available the inculpatory evidence provided orally by the third-party informant.", "284 Moreover, as is apparent from paragraph 250 above, that infringement cannot be remedied by the mere fact that the Commission has referred to that meeting in the course of the present judicial proceedings.", "285 In addition, the fact that, in the present case, the third-party informant did not wish to submit a formal complaint and to participate in the investigation as a complainant, and requested that its involvement be dealt with on an anonymous and confidential basis, cannot exempt the Commission from complying with its obligations and cannot permit it to affect adversely the rights of defence of the undertaking concerned.", "286 Any protection which, in certain circumstances, the Commission may legitimately grant to a natural or legal person making allegations of anticompetitive conduct on the part of an undertaking must be reconciled with respect for those rights of defence and, as appropriate, must be granted in a manner which does not render futile the exercise of such rights, in particular in the specific circumstances of the present case, by preparing a non-confidential and anonymous version of the written document or, by reason of the very specific, even unique, factual circumstances of the present case, by permitting access to the confidential version of that written document solely to the representatives of the undertaking concerned who have signed a confidentiality undertaking.", "287 It follows from all the foregoing that, as regards the meeting with the third-party informant, in the circumstances of the present case, the Commission failed to fulfil its obligations to make available the inculpatory evidence provided orally by the third-party informant.", "288 As regards the inferences to be drawn from the finding made in paragraph 287 above, in accordance with the case-law referred to in paragraphs 160 and 161 above, it must be established whether, in the light of the specific factual and legal circumstances of the present case, the applicant has demonstrated adequately that it would have been better able to ensure its defence had there been no procedural error.", "289 It should be noted at the outset that the applicant, through its representatives who had signed the confidentiality undertaking, submitted that the Commission had infringed its rights of defence, in that (i) an adequate record of the meeting in question could have contained exculpatory evidence, including information concerning the motivation of the third-party informant, (ii) the Commission had uncritically accepted the statements of the third-party informant and built its case on the basis of those statements, and (iii) the protection of that third-party informant’s anonymity was not justified.", "The applicant, through its representatives who had signed the confidentiality undertaking, added that, if it had been aware of the meeting in question during the administrative procedure, it would have been able to defend itself differently, put forward additional arguments, provide clarification on the validity and credibility of the third-party informant’s anonymity request, raise the issue with the Hearing Officer, the Commissioner for Competition or the European Ombudsman and to request access to internal Commission documents.", "290 First of all, in so far as, as has been stated in paragraph 281 above, the internal emails refer to allegations made by the third-party informant at the meeting in question, on the one hand, it should be recalled that it is apparent from the evidence submitted that the theory applied by the Commission in the contested decision – as set out in the title of Section 11.4.1 and in the wording of recital 412 of that decision – concurs with the inculpatory allegations made by the third-party informant at the meeting in question.", "On the other hand, it is common ground that the applicant – like the Court – has no precise indication of the inculpatory evidence provided orally by the third-party informant in support of those allegations.", "In those circumstances, the Court cannot therefore establish the extent to which, in the contested decision, the Commission relied on such information, or, as the applicant argues through its representatives who had signed the confidentiality undertaking, was unduly influenced by the third-party informant’s statements.", "291 However, in the specific circumstances of the present case, it cannot be disputed that, as the applicant argues, in essence, through its representatives who had signed the confidentiality undertaking, that meeting had an impact in the context of the administrative procedure which led to the adoption of the contested decision, the applicant having had no opportunity to make known its views on the origin, basis and credibility of the inculpatory allegations made by the third-party informant, which concur with a central aspect of the Commission’s reasoning in the contested decision against the applicant.", "Furthermore, it is not possible to accept the Commission’s argument that the information provided by the third-party informant at the meeting in question was not used in the contested decision, and that objections in the decision were proved by other evidence.", "That argument implies that the third-party informant provided other, possibly inculpatory, information to which the Commission has not yet referred.", "In any event, the precise information provided by that third party at the meeting in question remains unknown.", "292 Next, it should be observed that the internal emails also provide some indication as to the reasons for the Commission granting anonymity and confidentiality to the third-party informant.", "As the applicant pertinently states, via its representatives who had signed the confidentiality undertaking, it would have been better able to ensure its defence if it had been put in a position, where appropriate, in the very specific circumstances of the present case, via its representatives acting under a confidentiality undertaking, to be able to comment, at the stage of the administrative procedure, on the evidence relied on by the third-party informant in support of its request for anonymity and confidentiality.", "Indeed, any rejection of that request could have influenced the applicant’s defence in the context of its reply to the statement of objections, or the conduct of the administrative procedure, by involving, inter alia, an inter partes verification of the inculpatory allegations made by the third-party informant.", "293 Last, apart from the information in the internal emails concerning, first, the inculpatory allegations made by the third-party informant and, second, the reasons for the Commission granting it anonymity and confidentiality (paragraphs 290 and 292 above), it is common ground that the applicant – like the Court – has no indication as to whether other issues relevant to the investigation which led to the adoption of the contested decision were discussed between the third-party informant and the Commission at the meeting in question.", "294 Accordingly, the Court cannot establish with certainty what could have been discussed at that meeting and the extent to which exculpatory evidence, neutral evidence or even factual material was provided orally to the Commission by the third-party informant (see, by analogy, paragraphs 207 and 257 above).", "295 It must therefore be stated that, in the specific circumstances of the present case, having regard also to the clarification provided by the Commission in the confidential version of the document of 19 November 2020, to which the applicant’s representatives who had signed the confidentiality undertaking were able to have access, knowledge of the existence of the meeting in question and of the information provided to the Commission by the third-party informant could have been relevant for the applicant’s defence.", "296 It follows from all the foregoing that, having regard to the specific factual and legal circumstances of the present case, in so far as the Commission made no record of the meeting with the third-party informant and in so far as neither the applicant nor its representatives received any information concerning whether that meeting even took place, other than in the course of the present proceedings subsequent to the measures of inquiry of 12 October 2020, the Commission infringed the rights of defence of the applicant.", "The evidence submitted following the measure of inquiry of 12 October 2020 tends to demonstrate that that meeting could have provided information essential to the further course of the proceedings which could have been relevant to the applicant, by making it better able to ensure its defence.", "297 In view of that infringement of the rights of defence of the applicant, the third part of the first plea in the action must be upheld in so far as it relates to the meeting with a third party in respect of which information was provided to the applicant in the course of the present proceedings in response to the measures of inquiry of 12 October 2020.", "298 In the circumstances of the present case, it is appropriate to continue the examination by reviewing the first part of the first plea.", "3. The first part of the first plea: infringement of the rights of the defence, concerning the differences between the statement of objections and the contested decision", "299 The first part of the first plea alleges infringement of the rights of the defence, in so far as the statement of objections and the contested decision differ on key aspects of the analysis and complaints raised against the applicant.", "300 That part comprises, in essence, five complaints. In particular, the first complaint alleges that the statement of objections referred to abuse in the markets for UMTS chipsets and for LTE chipsets, whereas the contested decision refers to abuse in the market for LTE chipsets alone.", "The fourth complaint alleges that, by narrowing the scope of the abuse, ‘the “contestable” share of Apple’s demand assumed by the [statement of objections] was fundamentally different from that assumed by the [contested decision]’.", "301 Furthermore, in the context of the third part of the third plea in the action, and in particular its sixth complaint, the applicant, referring to the first part of the first plea, alleged infringement of its rights of defence and of its right to be heard on account of the fact that the contested decision diverged from the theory of harm set out in the statement of objections.", "302 It is therefore appropriate to examine together the first and fourth complaints in the first part of the first plea, also in the light of the sixth complaint in the third part of the third plea.", "303 In those respects, the applicant submits that the agreements concerned and the payments concerned relate to two types of chipset used in Apple devices (UMTS and LTE), but that the contested decision, unlike the statement of objections, refers solely to abuse on the market for LTE chipsets.", "The applicant states that it was denied the opportunity to comment on the critical margin analysis presented in the contested decision in view of the different contestable share of Apple’s demand, whereas the narrower scope of the contested decision does not operate to its advantage in that respect and those factors are fundamental to assessing foreclosure capacity in accordance with paragraph 140 of the judgment of 6 September 2017, Intel v Commission (C‑413/14 P, EU:C:2017:632).", "The applicant states that, despite the fact that the contested decision diverges substantially from the statement of objections, it did not have the opportunity to address the criticisms of the critical margin analysis or to correct the Commission’s revised analysis.", "304 The applicant adds that the altered findings on the chipsets concerned and on the contestable share of Apple’s demand are not in its favour.", "The Commission withdrew from the contested decision the objections relating to the supply of at least [confidential] UMTS chipsets, the payments relating to those chipsets therefore being lawful.", "However, the applicant states that in the contested decision the Commission ignored those units, distorting the analysis to the detriment of the applicant, since the payments relating to UMTS chipsets should have been excluded from the critical margin analysis.", "305 The Commission replies that the differences identified by the applicant concern the same conduct and did not trigger a further right to be heard and that the Commission was not required to send the applicant a supplementary statement of objections.", "In particular, the limitation of its objections solely to LTE chipsets is favourable to the applicant and demonstrates that the Commission respected its right to be heard.", "In addition, the Commission was not required to discuss with the applicant its doubts regarding the assumptions on which the analysis of the applicant’s critical margin was based.", "The Commission did not rely on any economic model in order to conclude that the exclusivity payments were capable of having anticompetitive effects and concluded only that the applicant’s critical margin analysis did not undermine its conclusion.", "No infringement of the right to be heard can be found, in so far as (i) the critical margin analysis was adduced by the applicant and (ii) the Commission did not rely on an alternative version of that analysis.", "The Commission is, furthermore, not required to provide an undertaking with the opportunity to comment on the Commission’s final assessment of the undertaking’s defence before it adopts its decision.", "306 The Commission adds that the argument alleging that a competing supplier might also have spread the costs of compensating for the exclusivity payments over [confidential] UMTS chipsets is (i) inadmissible, since it was not put forward in the application, and (ii) irrelevant, since Apple’s UMTS devices were existing devices and were not contestable for the purposes of the critical margin analysis, the last of such devices having been launched in 2011, whereas the first reference year for the critical margin analysis was 2012.", "Similarly, the argument that withdrawing the objections concerning UMTS chipsets was unfavourable, in addition to being inadmissible for the same reasons, is unfounded, since the applicant has not demonstrated how that had unfavourable consequences, particularly since the applicant, in its reply to the statement of objections, maintained that the Commission ought to withdraw its objections regarding UMTS chipsets.", "307 As a preliminary point, it should be recalled that Article 27(1) of Regulation No 1/2003 envisages that the parties are to be sent a statement of objections.", "That statement must set out clearly all the essential elements on which the Commission is relying at that stage of the procedure (order of 7 July 2016, Panasonic v Commission, C‑608/15 P, not published, EU:C:2016:538, paragraph 20).", "308 However, that information may be given in summary form and the Commission decision by which it finds the existence of an infringement is not necessarily required to be a copy of the statement of objections, since that statement of objections is a preparatory document containing assessments of fact and of law which are purely provisional in nature.", "The Commission is required to hear the addressees of a statement of objections and, where relevant, to take account of any observations made in response to the objections upheld by amending its analysis specifically in order to respect their rights of defence (order of 7 July 2016, Panasonic v Commission, C‑608/15 P, not published, EU:C:2016:538, paragraph 21).", "309 Furthermore, the statement of objections is a procedural measure adopted preparatory to the decision which represents the culmination of the administrative procedure.", "Consequently, until a final decision has been adopted, the Commission may, in view, in particular, of the written or oral observations of the parties, abandon some or even all of the objections initially made against them and thus alter its position in their favour or, conversely, decide to add new complaints, provided that it affords the undertakings concerned the opportunity of making known their views in that respect (judgment of 27 June 2012, Microsoft v Commission, T‑167/08, EU:T:2012:323, paragraph 184).", "310 Communication to the parties concerned of further objections is necessary only where the result of the investigations leads the Commission to take new facts into account against the undertakings or to alter materially the evidence for the contested infringements and not where the Commission fulfils its duty to abandon such objections as have, in the light of the replies to the statement of objections, been shown to be unfounded (judgment of 27 June 2012, Microsoft v Commission, T‑167/08, EU:T:2012:323, paragraph 191).", "311 It is necessary to assess the applicant’s arguments in the light of those principles.", "312 Those arguments concern, in essence, three distinct issues.", "313 In the first place, in so far as the applicant’s arguments make general reference to the fact that the Commission, in recital 388 of the contested decision, found abuse solely on the market for LTE chipsets, whereas, in recitals 254 and 256 of the statement of objections, the Commission was contemplating abuse on the market for LTE chipsets and on the market for UMTS chipsets, that fact, while being correct, does not in itself imply a procedural error, nor a fortiori an infringement of the rights of defence of the applicant.", "314 In the contested decision, the Commission limited the infringements found to have been committed by the applicant in comparison with those which it had contemplated in the statement of objections, by abandoning the infringement on the UMTS chipsets market.", "In other words, the Commission did not add new objections or evidence against the applicant, but rather abandoned certain objections which, in the light of the replies to the statement of objections, were shown to be unfounded.", "In accordance with the case-law referred to in paragraphs 309 and 310 above, such an alteration gives rise to no obligation on the Commission to provide the applicant with a supplementary statement of objections.", "315 In the second place, the applicant’s arguments refer to the fact that the Commission did not provide it with the opportunity to make known its views on the reasons which resulted, in the contested decision, in it rejecting the critical margin analysis which it had presented in its reply to the statement of objections.", "It should be noted that the Commission, before adopting the contested decision, was not required to provide the applicant with the opportunity to comment on why it intended to reject that analysis in the contested decision.", "The right to be heard covers all the matters of fact and of law which form the basis for the decision-making act but not the final position which the administration intends to adopt (see judgment of 15 March 2006, BASF v Commission, T‑15/02, EU:T:2006:74, paragraph 94 and the case-law cited; judgments of 19 May 2010, IMI and Others v Commission, T‑18/05, EU:T:2010:202, paragraph 109, and of 9 March 2015, Deutsche Börse v Commission, T‑175/12, not published, EU:T:2015:148, paragraph 344).", "316 In the third place, the applicant criticises the fact that the Commission, while having abandoned the objections relating to UMTS chipsets, did not take account of its having done so in its examination of the critical margin analysis and did not afford the applicant the opportunity to comment on the inferences to be drawn from such a circumstance as regards the critical margin analysis, which was unfavourable to it.", "As is apparent from the applicant’s written submissions and the explanations provided by it at the hearing, the applicant is criticising the fact that the Commission did not allow it to be heard regarding the data used in the critical margin analysis, given the fact that the objections concerning UMTS chipsets had been abandoned and did not allow it to amend those data accordingly.", "317 As a preliminary point, it must be recalled that, as follows from the case-law referred to in paragraph 159 above, respect for the rights of the defence means that any addressee of a decision finding that it has committed an infringement of the competition rules must have been afforded the opportunity during the administrative procedure to make known its views on the objections raised against it.", "318 In particular, the undertaking concerned may submit, during the administrative procedure, on the basis of supporting evidence, that its conduct was not capable of restricting competition and, in particular, of producing the alleged foreclosure effects (see, to that effect, judgment of 6 September 2017, Intel v Commission, C‑413/14 P, EU:C:2017:632, paragraph 138).", "319 In the present case, it is common ground that the statement of objections sent by the Commission to the applicant contemplated abuse of a dominant position both on the market for LTE chipsets and on the market for UMTS chipsets.", "In other words, the statement of objections contemplated abuse over two markets.", "320 It is also common ground that, in its reply to the statement of objections, the applicant presented a ‘critical margin analysis’ which sought to demonstrate that the conduct attributed to it was not capable of having foreclosure effects on those two markets.", "321 As the applicant confirmed expressly in response to a measure of organisation of procedure by the Court, without being contradicted by the Commission, the critical margin analysis submitted in response to the statement of objections concerned the UMTS chipsets and LTE chipsets covered by the agreements concerned and was based on the data relating to those two types of chipset.", "322 The critical margin analysis presented by the applicant is described in recital 487 of the contested decision and summarised in Table 16 in that recital.", "323 In essence, it is an economic analysis which seeks to demonstrate that a hypothetical competitor as efficient as the applicant could have competed with the applicant to supply LTE and UMTS chipsets to Apple, since that competitor would have been in a position to offer a price covering its costs while also being able to compensate Apple for the loss of the payments concerned.", "324 It is also common ground that, in the contested decision, before concluding that the applicant had abused its dominant position solely on the LTE chipsets market, the Commission rejected that same critical margin analysis submitted by the applicant in response to the statement of objections.", "As the Commission expressly stated in its written submissions, it did not express a view on an alternative version of that analysis.", "325 In particular, in the contested decision, the Commission presented that analysis, stated the reasons why it could not be accepted and presented a ‘revised’ analysis including its corrections.", "326 It is also apparent from the contested decision that the Commission rejected the critical margin analysis submitted by the applicant on account of it containing three allegedly incorrect assumptions, which the Commission corrected in its ‘revised’ analysis, and that the Commission in no way called into question the fact that that analysis was, as such, a tool making it possible to challenge the capability of the payments concerned to have foreclosure effects.", "327 In other words, in the contested decision, the Commission, first, rejected the critical margin analysis presented in response to the statement of objections including data concerning both LTE chipsets and UMTS chipsets and, second, carried out a ‘revised’ critical margin analysis which continued to rely on data concerning both LTE chipsets and UMTS chipsets, even though, in recitals 487, 491, 492, 498, 499 and 503 of the contested decision, in referring to that analysis, it erroneously referred only to LTE chipsets.", "328 In the contested decision, the Commission therefore presented, examined and revised a critical margin analysis (concerning both the market for UMTS chipsets and the market for LTE chipsets) which was not, or was no longer, relevant to the abuse found in that decision (which concerned solely the market for LTE chipsets).", "329 By proceeding in that manner, regardless of the substance of the three objections to the assumptions made in the applicant’s critical margin analysis and of the corresponding corrections made to it in the ‘revised’ critical margin analysis, the Commission infringed the applicant’s rights of defence.", "330 As is apparent from the case-law referred to in paragraph 318 above, the applicant was entitled to rely on evidence such as the critical margin analysis presented in response to the statement of objections in order to submit that its conduct was not capable of restricting competition and, in particular, of producing foreclosure effects.", "331 The applicant relied on that possibility by devoting, in the section of its reply to the statement of objections which sought to demonstrate that there were no foreclosure effects (Section VII), a subsection to a presentation of its critical margin analysis (Section VII.F).", "That critical margin analysis therefore had an important role in the applicant’s defence against the objections put forward by the Commission.", "Moreover, in the section of the contested decision concerning the existence of an abuse of a dominant position (Section 11), the Commission devoted a section to examining and rebutting that critical margin analysis (Section 11.5).", "332 The possibility for an undertaking to submit that conduct is not capable of restricting competition and, in particular, of having foreclosure effects by relying on an economic analysis such as the critical margin analysis adduced in the present case by the applicant is of no practical effect if the scope of the conduct concerned is modified by the Commission after the statement of objections as regards, in particular, the markets concerned.", "333 The definition of the scope of the conduct concerned affects the economic data used in that analysis, as regards in particular the costs and unit prices of the products concerned, the contestable share of the market or even the costs to be borne by an as-efficient competitor.", "334 A critical margin analysis concerning two allegedly distinct and non-substitutable product markets (such as, according to the contested decision, the markets for UMTS chipsets and for LTE chipsets) necessarily differs from an analysis concerning only one of those two markets (such as the market solely for LTE chipsets).", "335 In particular, in the present case, the alleged abuse having been limited solely to the LTE chipsets market has an effect on the essential parameters of an analysis such as the critical margin analysis.", "Such essential parameters are, notably, (i) the amount of the payments concerned, since, as the applicant states, payments corresponding to UMTS chipsets ought to have been excluded from the critical margin analysis, (ii) the contestable share taken into account in the critical margin analysis, that is to say, the share of Apple’s demand for which a competitor as efficient as the applicant could compete with the applicant and over which it could spread the costs necessary to compensate Apple for the loss of the payments concerned, and (iii) the costs and prices of chipsets taken into account in the critical margin analysis, since the Commission found, in particular, in the contested decision, that the average prices of UMTS and LTE chipsets were not similar (recital 217 of the contested decision).", "336 Therefore, in so far as the Commission’s alteration of the objections had an effect on the relevance of the data forming the basis of the critical margin analysis submitted by the applicant in response to the statement of objections in order to argue that its conduct was not capable of having foreclosure effects, that undertaking, in order to be able to exercise its rights of defence effectively, had to be put in a position to be heard and, where appropriate, to adapt that economic analysis, even if, in such a situation, the Commission was not required to communicate to it ‘further objections’ in accordance with the case-law recalled in paragraph 310 above and the findings made in paragraphs 313 and 314 above.", "337 The statement of objections is inherently provisional and subject to amendments to be made by the Commission in its further assessment on the basis of the observations submitted to it by the parties and subsequent findings of fact.", "Because it is provisional, the statement of objections does not prevent the Commission from altering its standpoint in favour of the undertakings concerned and it is not obliged, in doing so, to explain any differences with respect to its provisional assessments as set out in that statement (judgment of 16 January 2019, Commission v United Parcel Service, C‑265/17 P, EU:C:2019:23, paragraph 36).", "338 However, those considerations do not permit the inference that, subsequent to the statement of objections, the Commission may modify the scope of the objections in the light of which the undertaking concerned has presented an economic analysis, such as the critical margin analysis submitted by the applicant in the present case, without that modification being brought to the attention of that undertaking and allowing it to submit its comments in that regard, where necessary by adapting the economic analysis previously submitted.", "Such an interpretation would be contrary to the principle of observance of the rights of the defence and to Article 27(1) of Regulation No 1/2003, which require that the undertaking concerned must have had the opportunity of making known effectively its view on the matters to which the Commission has taken objection (see, by analogy, judgment of 16 January 2019, Commission v United Parcel Service, C‑265/17 P, EU:C:2019:23, paragraphs 31 and 37).", "339 Indeed, while, in the contested decision, the Commission was able to reject the critical margin analysis presented by the applicant which concerned the market for LTE chipsets and the market for UMTS chipsets, taking the view that it did not call into question its conclusions on the market for LTE chipsets alone, it cannot be inferred that it would have been able, in the same way, to reject a critical margin analysis concerning the market for LTE chipsets alone.", "340 It must therefore be held that, in the present case, in order to be able to have its views on the alleged foreclosure effect made known effectively and therefore to be better able to ensure its defence, the applicant ought to have been given the opportunity to be heard and, where necessary, to adapt its critical margin analysis in order to take into account the withdrawal of the objections relating to UMTS chipsets, the supply of which was no longer criticised by the Commission.", "341 That finding cannot be called into question by the Commission’s assertions disputing the admissibility and relevance of the applicant’s argument concerning the quantity of UMTS chipsets which was not taken into account, to its disadvantage (paragraph 306 above).", "First, that argument was put forward by the applicant in the reply in order to support the complaint made in the application that amending the scope of the abuse to exclude UMTS chipsets was unfavourable to it as regards its critical margin analysis.", "That argument is therefore admissible. Second, the applicant included UMTS chipsets in the critical margin analysis presented in response to the statement of objections, since the statement of objections also envisaged abuse on the market for UMTS chipsets and, in that regard, expressly stated, on the basis of the data provided by Apple, that Apple had sourced UMTS chipsets from the applicant from 2011 to 2014 for a total number of units corresponding, in essence, to the number relied on by the applicant (see Table 14 of the statement of objections).", "The applicant’s argument is therefore not irrelevant.", "342 It follows that the Commission infringed the rights of defence of the applicant, in that it did not hear the applicant on the consequences to be reached regarding the withdrawal of the objections concerning the market for UMTS chipsets as concerns the critical margin analysis submitted by the applicant in order to demonstrate that the conduct criticised was not capable of restricting competition and, in particular, of having foreclosure effects.", "343 In view of that infringement of the rights of defence of the applicant, the first part of the first plea in the action must also be upheld.", "344 It follows from the examination of the first plea in the action, and in particular its first and third parts, that the administrative procedure which led to the adoption of the contested decision is vitiated by a number of procedural errors which affected the applicant’s rights of defence.", "345 For those reasons, in view of the infringements of the rights of defence of the applicant established in the context of examining the first and third parts of the first plea, whether taken individually or jointly, and there being no need to give a ruling on the other parts of that plea raised by the applicant, the first plea in the action must be upheld and, on that basis, the contested decision must be set aside.", "346 In the circumstances of the present case, in the interests of the proper administration of justice, it is appropriate also to examine the third plea in the action.", "C. The third plea: manifest errors of law and of assessment regarding the finding that the agreements concerned were capable of having potential anticompetitive effects", "347 The third plea comprises three parts. The first alleges a manifest error of law and breach of the principles of legal certainty and legitimate expectations in that the Commission did not apply the correct legal standard.", "The second alleges manifest errors of law and of assessment in that the Commission failed to apply the case-law on pricing practices.", "The third alleges a manifest error of assessment in so far as the Commission found that the agreements concerned were capable of having potential anticompetitive effects.", "349 It should be recalled that it is in no way the purpose of Article 102 TFEU to prevent an undertaking from acquiring, on its own merits, the dominant position on a market.", "Nor does that provision seek to ensure that competitors less efficient than the undertaking with the dominant position should remain on the market (judgments of 27 March 2012, Post Danmark, C‑209/10, EU:C:2012:172, paragraph 21, and of 6 September 2017, Intel v Commission, C‑413/14 P, EU:C:2017:632, paragraph 133).", "350 Article 102 TFEU prohibits a dominant undertaking from, among other things, adopting pricing practices that have an exclusionary effect on competitors considered to be as efficient as it is itself and strengthening its dominant position by using methods other than those that are part of competition on the merits (see judgment of 6 September 2017, Intel v Commission, C‑413/14 P, EU:C:2017:632, paragraph 136 and the case-law cited).", "351 Thus, not every exclusionary effect is necessarily detrimental to competition. Competition on the merits may, by definition, lead to the departure from the market or the marginalisation of competitors that are less efficient and so less attractive to consumers from the point of view of, among other things, price, choice, quality or innovation (judgments of 27 March 2012, Post Danmark, C‑209/10, EU:C:2012:172, paragraph 22, and of 6 September 2017, Intel v Commission, C‑413/14 P, EU:C:2017:632, paragraph 134).", "352 In that context, however, a dominant undertaking has a special responsibility not to allow its behaviour to impair genuine, undistorted competition on the internal market (judgment of 6 September 2017, Intel v Commission, C‑413/14 P, EU:C:2017:632, paragraph 135).", "353 In that regard, it has already been held that an undertaking which is in a dominant position on a market and ties purchasers – even if it does so at their request – by an obligation or promise on their part to obtain all or most of their requirements exclusively from that undertaking abuses its dominant position within the meaning of Article 102 TFEU, whether the obligation is stipulated without further qualification or whether it is undertaken in consideration of the grant of a rebate.", "The same applies if the undertaking in question, without tying the purchasers by a formal obligation, applies, either under the terms of agreements concluded with those purchasers or unilaterally, a system of loyalty rebates, that is to say, discounts conditional on the customer’s obtaining all or most of its requirements – whether the quantity of its purchases be large or small – from the undertaking in a dominant position (see judgment of 6 September 2017, Intel v Commission, C‑413/14 P, EU:C:2017:632, paragraph 137 and the case-law cited).", "354 However, in the case where the undertaking concerned submits, during the administrative procedure, on the basis of supporting evidence, that its conduct was not capable of restricting competition and, in particular, of producing the alleged foreclosure effects, it is for the Commission to carry out an analysis of the foreclosure capacity of competitors that are at least as efficient (see, to that effect, judgment of 6 September 2017, Intel v Commission, C‑413/14 P, EU:C:2017:632, paragraphs 138 to 140).", "355 Indeed, if such conduct is to be characterised as abusive, that presupposes that that conduct was capable of restricting competition and, in particular, producing the alleged exclusionary effects, and that assessment must be undertaken having regard to all the relevant facts surrounding that conduct (see judgment of 30 January 2020, Generics (UK) and Others, C‑307/18, EU:C:2020:52, paragraph 154 and the case-law cited).", "356 If, in a decision, the Commission carries out such an analysis, the Court must examine all of the applicant’s arguments seeking to call into question the validity of the Commission’s findings as to the foreclosure capacity of competitors that are at least as efficient, relating to the practice in question (see, to that effect, judgment of 6 September 2017, Intel v Commission, C‑413/14 P, EU:C:2017:632, paragraph 141).", "357 Furthermore, in that latter regard, it should be recalled that the scope of judicial review provided for in Article 263 TFEU extends to all the elements of Commission decisions relating to proceedings under Article 102 TFEU, which are subject to in-depth review by the General Court, in law and in fact, in the light of the pleas raised by the applicant and taking into account all the elements submitted by the applicant, whether those elements pre-date or post-date the contested decision, whether they were submitted previously in the context of the administrative procedure or, for the first time, in the context of the proceedings before the General Court, in so far as those elements are relevant to the review of the legality of the Commission decision (judgment of 21 January 2016, Galp Energía España and Others v Commission, C‑603/13 P, EU:C:2016:38, paragraph 72).", "358 Even in areas giving rise to complex assessments, the EU Courts must, among other things, not only establish whether the evidence put forward is factually accurate, reliable and consistent, but must also determine whether that evidence contains all the relevant data that must be taken into consideration in appraising the situation and whether it is capable of substantiating the conclusions drawn from it (see, to that effect, judgment of 10 July 2014, Telefónica and Telefónica de España v Commission, C‑295/12 P, EU:C:2014:2062, paragraph 54).", "359 Last, in the field of competition law, where there is a dispute as to the existence of an infringement, it is for the Commission to prove the infringement found by it and to adduce evidence capable of demonstrating to the requisite legal standard the existence of the circumstances constituting an infringement.", "Where the Court still has a doubt, the benefit of that doubt must be given to the undertaking accused of the infringement (judgment of 22 November 2012, E.ON Energie v Commission, C‑89/11 P, EU:C:2012:738, paragraphs 71 and 72).", "(b) Summary of the structure of the contested decision", "360 In Section 11 of the contested decision, which is divided into eight parts, the Commission concluded that the applicant had abused its dominant position (see paragraph 33 above).", "361 In particular, in Section 11.3 of the contested decision, the Commission concluded that the payments concerned were exclusivity payments (recital 395 of the contested decision).", "362 In Section 11.4 of the contested decision, the Commission stated that the presumption that the grant of exclusivity payments by the applicant constituted an abuse of a dominant position was borne out in the circumstances of the present case by the analysis of the capability of the payments at issue to have anticompetitive effects (recital 406 of the contested decision).", "363 First, the Commission found that the payments concerned had reduced Apple’s incentives to switch to competing LTE chipset providers (Section 11.4.1 of the contested decision).", "364 Second, the Commission stated that Apple’s internal documents and explanations confirmed that the payments concerned had reduced Apple’s incentives to switch to competing LTE chipset suppliers (Section 11.4.2 of the contested decision).", "365 Third, the Commission found that the payments concerned covered a significant share of the market for LTE chipsets during the period concerned (Section 11.4.3 of the contested decision).", "366 Fourth, the Commission considered that Apple was an attractive customer because of its importance for entry or expansion in the relevant market (Section 11.4.4 of the contested decision).", "367 In Section 11.5 of the contested decision, the Commission concluded that the applicant’s critical margin analysis did not demonstrate that its exclusivity payments were incapable of having anticompetitive effects (recital 488 of the contested decision).", "368 As is apparent from paragraphs 361 and 362 above, the Commission did not confine itself to characterising the payments concerned as exclusivity payments, but carried out an analysis of the capability of those payments to have anticompetitive effects.", "Consequently, in accordance with the case-law referred to in paragraph 356 above, the Court must examine the applicant’s arguments seeking to call into question the validity of that analysis.", "369 In that regard, in the third part of the third plea, the applicant puts forward eight complaints and certain preliminary arguments by which it criticises the Commission, in essence, for having made manifest errors of assessment in its analysis of the capability of the payments concerned to have anticompetitive effects and in its assessment of the critical margin analysis presented by the applicant.", "370 As regards the analysis of the capability of the payments concerned to have anticompetitive effects, it is appropriate to examine the first three complaints in the third part of the third plea and the related preliminary arguments.", "2. The first complaint in the third part of the third plea: failure to take account of all the relevant circumstances", "371 The applicant submits that the contested decision does not provide evidence that the agreements concerned were capable of leading to the anticompetitive foreclosure of competitors.", "The applicant further submits that the Commission failed to prove that Intel or any other rival undertaking was capable of satisfying Apple’s exacting technical and scheduling requirements.", "On the contrary, the applicant argues that the contested decision acknowledges that no competitor was capable of supplying LTE chipsets for use in iPhones throughout the period concerned and contains no allegation that the payments concerned had any impact on Apple’s supply decisions for iPads launched in 2011 to 2013 and in 2016.", "The contested decision seeks to demonstrate the foreclosure of a single competitor (Intel) regarding supply for iPads to be launched in 2014 and 2015, which represents less than 1% of the relevant market and suggests that the payments concerned could not foreclose any competitor.", "372 The applicant maintains that the Commission failed to identify, analyse or interpret certain crucial facts and that the contested decision contains inaccuracies as regards the devices and competitors concerned.", "It states, as the Commission acknowledges in the contested decision, that the agreements concerned could not have foreclosed any competitor from supplying LTE chipsets used in iPhone models launched while those agreements were in force.", "In particular, as is apparent from the contested decision, between 2011 and 2015 Apple had no technical alternative as regards its requirements for LTE chipset for its iPhones.", "In addition, the Commission did not allege that the agreements concerned were capable of foreclosing any competitors in the supply of LTE chipsets used in the iPad models launched in 2011, 2012, 2013, and 2016.", "Thus, in essence, the Commission alleges only possible foreclosure of Intel from supplying LTE chipsets intended for use in iPads launched in 2014 and 2015.", "373 The applicant adds that the Commission acknowledges in the defence that Apple did not consider Intel to be a credible supplier of LTE chipsets for use in mobile phones.", "The applicant demonstrated that that was also the case for any other competitor. Last, the applicant asserts that the Commission has not addressed any of the arguments that the capability to foreclose should have been determined by reference to all chipset customers in the wider relevant market.", "The contested decision does not even allege potential anticompetitive foreclosure from the market, as opposed to being prevented from supplying a particular customer.", "374 Against this, the Commission contends that the applicant’s arguments are based on a fundamental misconception of the contested decision.", "The Commission found that, throughout the period concerned, the applicant had made exclusivity payments to Apple in respect of both iPhones and iPads which were capable of having anticompetitive effects, Intel being merely a tangible example of that capability.", "The Commission’s findings therefore include, in particular, but are not limited to, the fact that the payments concerned actually affected Apple’s procurement decisions for iPads intended to be launched in 2014 and 2015.", "The Commission argues that, given the applicant’s misunderstanding, it is unnecessary for the Court to consider the third part of the third plea further but, in any event, the Commission puts forward arguments to refute the applicant’s arguments.", "375 Accordingly, first of all, the Commission submits that the applicant has not identified clearly the relevant circumstances or the reasons why the Commission erred in giving weight to the factors upon which it relied.", "Next, the Commission refers to the circumstances set out in recital 411 of the contested decision. In particular, the Commission (i) states that the extent of the applicant’s dominance, the market coverage and the conditions under which payments were granted are factors to be taken into account, (ii) makes clear that the third part of the third plea does not address the issue of the duration of the agreements concerned, (iii) specifies that the amount of the payments concerned was significant, and (iv) explains that the contested decision is not based on the existence of a strategy to foreclose.", "Last, the Commission explains that, according to the contested decision, the payments concerned were capable of having anticompetitive effects throughout the period concerned and that they actually did have anticompetitive effects on the LTE chipset procurement decisions for iPads which Apple planned to launch in 2014 and 2015.", "376 Second, the Commission states that it did not acknowledge that Intel was a less efficient competitor.", "The applicant, it submits, fails to take account of the finding in recital 464 of the contested decision that Apple regarded Intel as an attractive source of LTE chipsets for its iPads.", "In any event, the finding made in recital 486 is not based solely on it being accepted that Intel was an as-efficient competitor, since the Commission took into account the capability of the payments concerned to have foreclosure effects on any as-efficient competitor, recital 426 of the contested decision noting that Apple had considered three alternative suppliers for the iPads which it planned to launch in 2014.", "377 The Commission adds that the applicant’s insistence that Intel could not be considered to be an as-efficient competitor serves no purpose, since the conclusion regarding the capability of the payments concerned to have anticompetitive effects applies to an as-efficient competitor.", "378 As a preliminary point, and assuming that the Commission’s arguments – that an examination of the third part of the third plea serves no purpose – must be understood as pleading that that part is ineffective, they must be rejected as unfounded.", "In the context of that part of the plea, the parties disagree, in essence, on the validity of the Commission’s demonstration in the contested decision as to the capability of the payments concerned to have anticompetitive effects.", "Therefore, if the third part of the third plea were to prove to be well founded, it would result in the contested decision being set aside.", "379 In that context, for the purposes of examining the applicant’s arguments, certain elements relating to the structure and content of the contested decision must first be recalled.", "380 First of all, it must be pointed out that, while the relevant market found by the Commission in the contested decision is the worldwide market for LTE chipsets (see paragraph 31 above), the applicant’s conduct falls solely within the scope of its contractual relations with Apple.", "More specifically, the Commission found that the unlawful conduct consisted of the applicant granting the payments concerned to Apple (Article 1 of the operative part of the contested decision).", "381 Next, it must be recalled that, in Section 11.4 of the contested decision, the Commission concluded that the payments concerned constituted an abuse of a dominant position on the ground that they were exclusivity payments capable of having anticompetitive effects (recital 406 of the contested decision), in that they had reduced Apple’s incentives to switch to the applicant’s competitors (recital 407 of the contested decision).", "382 In particular, the Commission demonstrated the reduction of Apple’s incentives to switch to the applicant’s competitors in Sections 11.4.1 and 11.4.2 of the contested decision (recitals 407 and 408 of the contested decision).", "383 Last, it should be noted that, in order to reach the conclusion that the payments concerned were capable of having anticompetitive effects, in the contested decision, the Commission stated that it had also taken account of the significant share of the relevant market covered by the payments concerned referred to in Section 11.4.3 of the contested decision (recitals 409 and 411 of the contested decision), the importance of Apple as a customer for entry or expansion on the relevant market referred to in Section 11.4.4 of the contested decision (recitals 410 and 411 of the contested decision) as well as the extent of the applicant’s dominant position referred to in Section 10 of the contested decision, the conditions for granting the payments concerned referred to in Section 11.3 of the contested decision and the duration and amount of those payments referred to in Section 11.4.1 and Section 11.8 of the contested decision (recital 411 of the contested decision).", "By contrast, as is apparent from the contested decision and as the Commission confirmed in its written submissions, it did not rely on the existence of a strategy to foreclose, that is to say, anticompetitive intent on the part of the applicant.", "384 In so far as, as is apparent from paragraph 381 above, the Commission’s conclusion that the payments concerned were capable of having anticompetitive effects is based, above all, on the assessment that those payments had reduced Apple’s incentives to switch to the applicant’s competitors, it is appropriate to begin by examining whether, as the applicant submits, the Commission made such an assessment without taking account of all the relevant circumstances.", "385 In the first place, it must be recalled that, as was observed in paragraph 382 above, the Commission arrived at the assessment that the payments concerned had reduced Apple’s incentives to switch to the applicant’s competitors in accordance with the analysis contained in Sections 11.4.1 and 11.4.2 of the contested decision.", "386 First, in Section 11.4.1 of the contested decision, the Commission arrived at that assessment (recital 412 of the contested decision) on the basis of a comparative analysis of the amount of the payments concerned received during the period concerned (recital 413 of the contested decision), of the amount of the payments concerned which Apple would have lost had it launched a device incorporating an LTE chipset from a competitor of the applicant during the period concerned (recital 414 of the contested decision) and of the amount of the repayments which Apple would have had to make had it launched a device incorporating an LTE chipset of a competitor of the applicant in 2013, 2014 and 2015 (recital 416 of the contested decision) and the potential cumulative impact of that loss and that repayment of the payments concerned (recital 417 of the contested decision).", "387 Second, in Section 11.4.2 of the contested decision, the Commission found that Apple’s internal documents and explanations confirmed that assessment (recital 423 of the contested decision).", "Section 11.4.2 comprises four parts: the first contains the Commission’s analysis of Apple’s internal documents and explanations (Section 11.4.2.1 of the contested decision); the second seeks to respond to the applicant’s argument that those internal documents and explanations are unreliable (Section 11.4.2.2 of the contested decision); the third seeks to respond to the applicant’s argument that Apple requested the exclusivity (Section 11.4.2.3 of the contested decision); and the fourth seeks to respond to the applicant’s argument that Apple chose it, in any event, given the higher quality of its LTE chipsets and contains the Commission’s assessment that, contrary to the applicant’s arguments, the payments concerned had an impact on Apple’s sourcing strategy (Section 11.4.2.4 of the contested decision).", "388 In the second place, it should be noted that, as is apparent from their content and from the explanations provided by the Commission before the Court, the demonstrations provided in Sections 11.4.1 and 11.4.2 of the contested decision differ in scope.", "389 First, Section 11.4.1 of the contested decision seeks to demonstrate that the payments concerned had reduced Apple’s incentives to switch to the applicant’s competitors during the period concerned to source LTE chipsets for all its devices, namely iPhones and iPads.", "In that context, as is apparent from the contested decision and as the Commission clarified before the Court, it relied on an analysis of the capability of the payments concerned to have anticompetitive effects.", "390 Furthermore, as regards Apple’s demand for LTE chipsets referred to in the Commission’s analysis, it should be noted that, in Section 11.4.3 of the contested decision, in order to determine the market coverage of the payments concerned, the Commission referred also to all the LTE chipsets obtained by Apple from the applicant, without distinguishing between iPhones and iPads.", "Similarly, in Section 11.4.4 of the contested decision, the Commission found that Apple was an attractive customer for LTE chipset suppliers, without distinguishing between iPhones and iPads.", "391 Accordingly, Section 11.4.1 of the contested decision, like Sections 11.4.3 and 11.4.4 of the contested decision, concerns the whole of Apple’s LTE chipset demand for iPhones and iPads.", "The Commission confirmed, moreover, in its written submissions that it had found that, throughout the period concerned, the payments concerned were capable of having anticompetitive effects in relation to the LTE chipsets intended for both iPhones and iPads.", "392 Second, Section 11.4.2 of the contested decision seeks to confirm, essentially on the basis of Apple’s internal documents and explanations, the assessment in Section 11.4.1 of the contested decision and, more specifically, as is apparent from the contested decision and as the Commission clarified before the Court, to demonstrate that the payments concerned had actually reduced Apple’s incentives to switch to the applicant’s competitors in order to source LTE chipsets for some of its devices.", "393 In that regard, in the defence, the Commission confirmed expressly that that section of the contested decision sought to demonstrate that the payments concerned had ‘actually affected’, or had the ‘actual effect of affecting’, Apple’s LTE chipset procurement decisions for ‘iPads that [it] planned to launch in 2014 and 2015’.", "Accordingly, the Commission explained that the conclusion it had reached in that regard concerned the ‘actual effects’ of the payments concerned.", "394 Furthermore, as regards Apple’s demand for LTE chipsets referred to by its analysis contained in Section 11.4.2 of the contested decision, when questioned under a measure of organisation of procedure on the scope of the words and expressions ‘devices’, ‘launched’ (in 2014 and 2015) and ‘to be launched’ (in 2014 and 2015) used in that section, the Commission confirmed expressly that that section did not concern iPhones but only iPads, stated that there had been a regrettable ‘clerical error’ in that that section referred to iPads actually ‘launched’ in 2014 and 2015 and went on to confirm expressly that that section concerned solely certain ‘non-CDMA’ iPads which were ‘to be launched’ by Apple in 2014 and 2015.", "395 It follows that, as is apparent from the content of the contested decision and as the Commission confirmed both in its written submissions and at the hearing, first, the whole of the Commission’s analysis found in Section 11.4.1 of the contested decision concerns the capability of the payments concerned to have anticompetitive effects in connection with both iPhones and iPads, as is suggested, moreover, by the title of Section 11.4 of the contested decision in so far as it refers generally to the ‘potential’ anticompetitive effects of those payments.", "That analysis is covered by the first complaint in the third part of the third plea. Second, the Commission’s analysis contained in Section 11.4.2 of the contested decision concerns the effects that the payments concerned would actually have had in connection with certain iPad models which Apple planned to launch in 2014 and 2015.", "That analysis is covered by the second and third complaints in the third part of the third plea (see paragraph 429 et seq.", "396 In the third place, in accordance with the case-law referred to in paragraph 355 above, the analysis of whether the payments concerned were capable of restricting competition and, in particular, of foreclosing at least as-efficient competitors must be carried out in the light of all the relevant factual circumstances surrounding that conduct.", "397 It follows that, since all the relevant circumstances surrounding the conduct complained of must be taken into account, the analysis of the anticompetitive capability of that conduct cannot be purely hypothetical (see, to that effect, judgment of 6 October 2015, Post Danmark, C‑23/14, EU:C:2015:651, paragraphs 65 and 68).", "398 In the fourth place, in the light of the foregoing, it is necessary to examine whether, as the applicant maintains, the Commission arrived at the assessment that the payments concerned had reduced Apple’s incentives to switch to the applicant’s competitors to source LTE chipsets for iPhones and iPads to be launched during the period concerned without having properly taken account of all the relevant factual circumstances.", "399 First, it is apparent from the contested decision that, for iPhone and iPad models launched before 2011, Apple sourced UMTS chipsets from Infineon, whose chipset supply activities were acquired by Intel in 2011 (recitals 89 and 90 of the contested decision).", "Between 2011 and 2015, and until 16 September 2016, namely during the period concerned, Apple obtained LTE chipsets for iPhones and iPads only from the applicant (recital 168 of the contested decision).", "Starting from the iPhone 7 launched on 16 September 2016, Apple incorporated Intel’s LTE chipsets into certain versions of that model (recitals 91 and 169 of the contested decision).", "400 Second, as the applicant states, it should be noted that, in recital 322 of the contested decision, in the context of Section 10 of that decision concerning the applicant’s dominant position, the Commission found that, between 2011 and 2015, ‘Apple had no alternative as regards its requirements of LTE chipsets for its iPhone devices’.", "401 In that regard, first, it should be noted that, in the contested decision, the Commission did not state the basis for the finding made in recital 322 of that decision.", "The related footnote 392, in the version of the contested decision notified to the applicant, refers to a section of the contested decision which does not exist (Section 0) and, in the public version of the contested decision, refers, with no further explanation, to Section 11.4.2 of the contested decision.", "However, it should be recalled that, as the Commission confirmed in response to the measures of organisation of procedure, Section 11.4.2 of the contested decision does not concern iPhones, but concerns only certain iPad models to be launched in 2014 and 2015 (paragraph 394 above).", "When questioned in that regard at the hearing, the Commission explained that the reference to Section 0 in the version of the contested decision notified to the applicant was the result of a technical error and that the reference to Section 11.4.2 of the contested decision in the public version of the contested decision, had to be understood in contrast, meaning that while Apple had no alternative to the applicant’s LTE chipsets for iPhones to be launched between 2011 and 2015 in accordance with recital 322 of the contested decision, it did have such an alternative for certain iPads to be launched in 2014 and 2015, in accordance with Section 11.4.2 of the contested decision.", "402 Second, it is apparent from the contested decision that the finding in recital 322 of that decision refers to the lack of technical alternative as regards Apple’s requirements for LTE chipsets for iPhones.", "In recital 447 of the contested decision, relying on Apple’s comments on the applicant’s response to the statement of objections, the Commission stated that, for devices to be launched in 2016, Intel’s improvement in ‘key technologies’ would have enabled Intel to be considered for iPhones and not only for iPads.", "Similarly, in recitals 491, 492 and 495 of the contested decision, the Commission stated that Apple’s requirements for LTE chipsets for iPhones were not contestable between 2012 and 2015, highlighting, inter alia, the fact that Intel’s LTE chipsets lacked certain technical functionalities.", "403 In response to the questions put by the Court at the hearing regarding the basis for the finding in recital 322 of the contested decision, both the Commission and the applicant confirmed expressly, first, that that finding ought in fact to be understood as referring to there being no technical alternative in view of Apple’s requirements for LTE chipsets for iPhones which were to be launched between 2011 and 2015 and, second, that that finding was correct from a factual point of view.", "404 Moreover, in the context of the present dispute, it is not necessary to establish the technical functionality or functionalities concerned by that lack of an alternative for the various iPhone models which Apple had to launch between 2011 and 2015, and in particular whether what was involved was (i) the ‘Code Division Multiple Access’ (CDMA) standard referred to in the statements reproduced in recital 187(2), and in recitals 454 and 461 of the contested decision, (ii) ‘Voice over LTE’ (VoLTE) technology referred to in the statement set out in footnote 586 to the contested decision relating (by means of a reference to footnote 587) to recital 447 of that decision, (iii) ‘voice connectivity’ or ‘voice functionality’ referred to in recital 492 of the contested decision, or other functionalities.", "405 Whatever the technical explanation for the finding of fact made by the Commission in recital 322 of the contested decision, it is common ground between the parties that Apple had no technical alternative to the applicant’s LTE chipsets as regards its requirements for iPhones to be launched between 2011 and 2015.", "406 Moreover, there is nothing in the contested decision to indicate, first, that Apple envisaged obtaining supplies, for iPhones to be launched between 2011 and 2015, of LTE chipsets which did not meet its technical requirements and, second, that that lack of an alternative for iPhones, noted in recital 322 of the contested decision, was for reasons other than technical reasons.", "407 Third, in recitals 491, 493 and 495 of the contested decision, the Commission also observed that only approximately half of Apple’s requirements for LTE chipsets for iPhones to be launched in 2016 were contestable.", "To that end, in recital 493 of the contested decision, the Commission relied on a statement by Apple, contained in Apple’s comments on the applicant’s reply to the statement of objections, indicating that it was able to obtain only less than half of its volume requirements for iPhones to be launched in 2016 from Intel.", "The information in the contested decision in that regard also refers to technical considerations. Footnote 586 to the contested decision, which reproduces Apple’s comments on the applicant’s response to the statement of objections, indicates that Apple could have obtained supplies from Intel only for the ‘non-CDMA portion’ of its requirements for LTE chipsets for iPhones to be launched in 2016, which substantiates Apple not being able to obtain supplies from Intel for the CDMA portion of those requirements.", "408 Fourth, according to the estimates in the contested decision, iPhones represented approximately 90% of Apple’s sales of LTE devices during the period concerned, and therefore of its requirements for LTE chipsets, while iPads represented approximately 10% of Apple’s sales of LTE devices during the period concerned, and therefore of those requirements (see recital 421 of the contested decision).", "409 It follows that, for a very large part of Apple’s requirements for LTE chipsets for devices to be launched during the period concerned, namely all iPhones to be launched between 2011 and 2015 and more than half of iPhones to be launched in 2016, Apple had no technical alternative to the applicant’s LTE chipsets and could not therefore switch to competing suppliers.", "410 The undisputed fact that, on the relevant market, there was no technical alternative to the applicant’s LTE chipsets for a very large part of Apple’s requirements during the period concerned is a relevant factual circumstance which must be taken into account when analysing the capability of the payments concerned to have foreclosure effects, since the Commission found that capability in the light of Apple’s total requirements for LTE chipsets and, in particular, in the light of the reduction of Apple’s incentives to switch to the applicant’s competitors for all its requirements.", "411 Fifth, in the light of the foregoing, it must be held that the Commission reached the conclusion that the payments concerned were capable of restricting competition in that they had reduced Apple’s incentives to switch to the applicant’s competitors to source LTE chipsets for all of its demand for iPhones and iPads on the basis of an analysis in which the Commission failed to take proper account of all the relevant factual circumstances surrounding the conduct concerned.", "412 Although the Commission found that Apple had no technical alternative to the applicant’s LTE chipsets for all iPhones to be launched between 2011 and 2015 and for more than half of the iPhones to be launched in 2016, it did not make a link between that relevant factual circumstance, which implied that no competitors were able to supply Apple with LTE chipsets for those iPhones, and the alleged lessening of Apple’s incentives to switch to the applicant’s competitors to source LTE chipsets for all its requirements, including therefore for iPhones, although those devices represented a very large part of those requirements.", "413 Moreover, in Section 11.5 of the contested decision, the Commission, in contradiction, relied inter alia on that circumstance in order to reject the applicant’s critical margin analysis, on the ground that the contestable share of Apple’s demand relied on by the applicant did not take account of the fact that Apple could not have switched supplier for LTE chipsets for iPhones to be launched in 2012, 2013, 2014 and 2015 and for more than half of the iPhones to be launched in 2016 (recital 491 and recital 495(2) of the contested decision).", "414 In those circumstances, in so far as the Commission failed to take account of the fact that Apple could not switch to any other supplier to fulfil its technical requirements for a very large part of its LTE chipset demand (corresponding to iPhones, with the exception of less than half of the iPhones to be launched in 2016), it could not legitimately conclude that the payments concerned had reduced Apple’s incentives to switch to the applicant’s competitors for all of its requirements covering all iPhones and iPads to be launched during the period concerned, and that those payments were, accordingly, capable of restricting competition in the entire relevant market for LTE chipsets.", "The fact – which was not properly taken into account in the contested decision – that Apple sourced LTE chipsets from the applicant, and not from the applicant’s competitors, in the light of the absence of alternatives fulfilling its own technical requirements could fall within competition on the merits, and not an anticompetitive foreclosure effect resulting from the payments concerned.", "415 It is true that Article 102 TFEU prohibits conduct of an undertaking in a dominant position the purpose of which is to strengthen that position and to abuse it, in particular when such conduct is intended to deprive parties demonstrated to be potential competitors of effective access to a market (see, to that effect, judgment of 30 January 2020, Generics (UK) and Others, C‑307/18, EU:C:2020:52, paragraph 151).", "In the present case, in view of the theory of harm set out in the contested decision, which is based on a reduction in Apple’s incentives to switch to the applicant’s competitors for the whole of its LTE chipset requirements during the period concerned, the Commission could not ignore the circumstance that, because of its own technical requirements, Apple could not switch to the applicant’s competitors for a very large part of its LTE chipset demand during that period.", "416 Moreover, it must be stated that, in the contested decision, the Commission in no way maintained that the applicant’s conduct prevented competitors which were less efficient than the applicant from developing products fulfilling Apple’s requirements, but solely that Apple’s incentives to switch to the applicant’s competitors for all its LTE chipset requirements had been reduced.", "In any event, it should be pointed out that, as is apparent from the case-law referred to in paragraph 351 above, competition on the merits may lead to the departure from the market or the marginalisation of competitors which are less efficient and so less attractive to consumers from the point of view of, among other things, price, choice, quality or innovation.", "417 It follows from all of the foregoing that the Commission’s conclusion regarding the capability of the payments concerned to have foreclosure effects on the ground that they had reduced Apple’s incentives to switch to the applicant’s competitors in order to source LTE chipsets for all its demand is based on an analysis which was not carried out in the light of all the relevant factual circumstances and which is, on that ground, unlawful.", "418 That finding is unaffected by the Commission’s other arguments.", "419 First, at the hearing, in response to questions put by the Court, the Commission relied on recital 421 of the contested decision in order to argue that it described the ‘leverage’ effect on which the demonstration of the capability of the payments concerned to have anticompetitive effects was founded.", "In essence, according to the Commission, even if were not technically possible for the applicant’s competitors to provide supply for iPhones, the agreements concerned made it possible for the applicant to ‘leverage’ that non-contestable share of Apple’s demand relating to iPhones in order to foreclose competitors on the contestable share of that demand relating to iPads and, accordingly, to prevent competitors from expanding and growing on the market.", "420 In that regard, first of all, it must be observed that the Commission’s argument does not align with the theory of harm set out in the contested decision, which refers to the capability of the payments concerned to have anticompetitive effects on the whole of the relevant market for LTE chipsets on the ground that Apple was dissuaded from sourcing from the applicant’s competitors for the whole of its LTE chipset requirements for iPhones and iPads.", "In other words, the contested decision refers to a foreclosure effect concerning all LTE chipsets for both iPhones and iPads equally, and not to a foreclosure effect limited solely to Apple’s sourcing of LTE chipsets for iPads.", "Moreover, first, in the contested decision, the infringement which the applicant is alleged to have committed was defined by reference to Apple’s total demand for iPhones and iPads and, second, the very concept of the applicant using ‘leverage’ in relation to the various Apple devices does not appear in the reasoning put forward by the Commission in Section 11.4 of the contested decision.", "421 Next, it must be noted that, while it forms part of Section 11.4.1 of the contested decision, recital 421 of that decision seeks to respond, together with recitals 419 and 420 of that decision, to an argument put forward by the applicant during the administrative procedure concerning the ability of the applicant’s competitors to offer identical incentives to Apple.", "It is therefore not possible to make a finding that the theory of harm underpinning the capability of the payments concerned to have anticompetitive effects is explained in that recital.", "Moreover, in any event, contrary to the Commission’s suggestion, recital 421 of the contested decision contains no clear indication that the applicant, through the non-contestable share of Apple’s demand for LTE chipsets, obtained ‘leverage’ over the contestable share of that demand.", "422 Last, for the sake of completeness, it should be noted that the Commission’s argument taken from recital 421 of the contested decision is based on the premiss that the contested decision demonstrates the anticompetitive capability of the payments concerned in relation to iPads.", "First, as has been observed in paragraph 391 above, in Sections 11.4.1, 11.4.3 and 11.4.4 of the contested decision, the Commission carried out a general analysis of the capability of the payments concerned to have anticompetitive effects, without carrying out any specific analysis relating to iPads.", "Second, as observed in paragraphs 392 to 394 above, in relation to iPads, in Section 11.4.2 of the contested decision, the Commission did no more than examine the alleged actual effects of the payments concerned in relation to non-CDMA iPad models to be launched in 2014 and 2015, an analysis which is covered by the second and third complaints examined below.", "423 Second, as has been pointed out in paragraph 375 above, the Commission relies on the factors mentioned in recital 411 of the contested decision and which are referred to in paragraph 383 above in order to demonstrate that it took into account the relevant circumstances of the present case.", "424 First, in so far as the Commission relies on the conditions for granting the payments concerned referred to in Section 11.3 of the contested decision, it should be recalled that, in that section, the Commission did no more than conclude that the payments concerned were exclusivity payments, and that the analysis of the alleged capability of those payments to have anticompetitive effects was found in Section 11.4 of that decision.", "In addition, it must be observed that, in the circumstances of the present case, characterising the payments concerned as exclusive payments was not sufficient to conclude that those payments constituted an abuse of a dominant position.", "In accordance with the case-law referred to in paragraph 354 above, in view of the objections put forward by the applicant during the administrative procedure, the Commission was required to carry out an analysis of (i) the capability of the payments concerned to have anticompetitive effects and, in particular, (ii) the foreclosure capacity of at least as-efficient competitors.", "425 Second, while the Commission is correct in stating, in essence, that the factors referred to in paragraph 383 above should not be disregarded, the fact remains that those factors, while they may be relevant to assessing the capability of conduct to have anticompetitive effects, do not in themselves demonstrate, in the present case, anticompetitive effect and, in particular, foreclosure.", "The same applies in relation to the extent of the applicant’s dominant position (referred to in Section 10 of the contested decision), the duration and amount of the payments concerned (referred to in Section 11.4.1 and Section 11.8 of the contested decision), the market share covered by those payments (referred to in Section 11.4.3 of the contested decision) and the importance of Apple as a customer (referred to in Section 11.4.4 of the contested decision).", "Making reference to those factors cannot call into question the fact that, in the present case, the Commission’s demonstration of the capability of the payments concerned to have anticompetitive effects, in particular as regards the capability of the practice at issue to foreclose at least as-efficient competitors, was not carried out in the light of all the relevant factual circumstances surrounding the conduct concerned given the alleged reduction in Apple’s incentives to switch to the applicant’s competitors for all its LTE chipset requirements for iPhones and iPads.", "426 Moreover, it should be noted that, as is apparent from the contested decision and as the Commission expressly stated before the Court, in that same decision it did not rely on an economic model, such as an as-efficient competitor test, in order to conclude that the payments concerned were capable of having anticompetitive effects and, in Section 11.5 of the contested decision, the Commission merely stated that the critical margin analysis presented by the applicant did not undermine its conclusions.", "427 Third, the Commission’s arguments regarding recitals 426, 464 and 486 of the contested decision cannot be accepted.", "Recitals 426 and 464, which relate to Section 11.4.2 of the contested decision, concern only certain iPad models to be launched in 2014 and 2015 and cannot therefore undermine the findings made in paragraph 409 above in relation to iPhones.", "Last, contrary to the Commission’s suggestion, the conclusion in recital 486 of the contested decision is also not capable of undermining those findings.", "428 In the light of all those factors, the first complaint in the third part of the third plea in the action must be upheld.", "3. The second and third complaints in the third part of the third plea: failure to demonstrate that the agreements concerned influenced Apple’s sourcing decisions concerning ‘2014’ and ‘2015’ iPads", "429 The second and third complaints in the third part of the third plea seek to challenge the demonstration made in Section 11.4.2 of the contested decision.", "430 The applicant disputes the Commission’s findings in recitals 424 and 451 of the contested decision, claiming that the contested decision does not prove, as regards the first of those recitals, that the agreements concerned reduced Apple’s incentives to switch to competing suppliers for ‘devices launched in 2014 and 2015’ or, as regards the second of those recitals, that they had an impact on Apple’s sourcing strategy for ‘devices to be launched in 2014 and 2015’.", "431 First, as regards the ‘2014’ iPads, the applicant maintains, first of all, that the contested decision contains no evidence that Apple considered using Intel chipsets in the iPads ‘actually released in October 2014’.", "Next, the Commission makes a number of references to an iPad model that Apple ‘[confidential]’, called ‘[confidential]’, but does not demonstrate that the agreements concerned influenced Apple’s sourcing decision for that model.", "However, Apple never seriously considered using Intel chipsets for that model, rather it realised that the Intel chipset could not be used, which is confirmed by the applicant’s report annexed to its reply to the statement of objections.", "Last, it was the inability of Intel’s chipsets to satisfy Apple’s technical and schedule requirements which explains why they were not selected for use in ‘2014’ iPads.", "432 The applicant adds that the Commission’s assertion that it was aware of the devices for which Apple was considering obtaining supplies from Intel is incorrect.", "In addition, the contested decision contains no analysis regarding the selection of the supplier for the ‘[confidential]’ model and does not establish a causal link between the first amendment to the transition agreement and the decision to use the applicant’s chipset for the ‘[confidential]’ model.", "433 The Commission states, first of all, that the contested decision concerns devices ‘to be launched in 2014’, and not those ‘actually released’.", "The applicant was, it submits, well aware of the devices for which Apple was considering obtaining supplies from Intel.", "Apple also confirmed that it was seeking to diversify its sourcing. Next, as regards the ‘[confidential]’ model, the Commission states that recitals 428 to 435 of the contested decision demonstrate the impact of the agreements concerned.", "In addition, the negotiations between the applicant and Apple concerning the first amendment to the transition agreement influenced Apple’s purchasing decision taken at the beginning of 2013.", "The transition agreement was in any event sufficient to influence Apple, which was considering the introduction of Intel for some of the iPads to be launched in 2014.", "In addition, the applicant’s allegation that Apple never seriously considered using Intel’s chipsets in the ‘[confidential]’ model is not substantiated.", "Last, as regards the report submitted by the applicant as an annex to its reply to the statement of objections, the Commission refers to Apple’s response in that regard in its comments on the applicant’s response to the statement of objections.", "434 The Commission adds that Apple had decided to [confidential] and that that decision had been influenced by the conclusion of the first amendment to the transition agreement and by the loss of the payments concerned resulting from the transition agreement.", "Apple’s documents demonstrate that the payments concerned did actually affect the decision to purchase LTE chipsets for ‘iPads that [it] planned to launch in 2014’.", "435 Second, as regards the ‘2015’ iPads, the applicant states that the Commission does not refer to the iPad models ‘launched’ in spring or in September and November 2015, or to those which ‘[were] to be launched in spring 2015’, but refers to an undefined model ‘to be released in fall 2015’.", "In the applicant’s view, in order to substantiate the assertion that Intel chipsets had been seriously considered, the contested decision relies on only one email from a single Apple engineer whom the Commission misquotes.", "The file contains no evidence, in particular from Apple employees who actually made chipset purchasing decisions, showing that Intel’s chipset was a genuine option.", "In addition, the evidence in the file shows that Intel’s chipsets failed to comply with Apple’s technical and schedule requirements.", "436 The applicant adds that the Commission interpreted certain Apple internal documents for the first time in the defence.", "437 The Commission notes, as regards the actual effects of the payments concerned on chipset purchases, that Apple’s internal emails demonstrate Apple’s interest in using another supplier.", "Next, in the email from an Apple engineer referred to in recital 436 of the contested decision there is no uncertainty regarding Intel’s chipset, which is confirmed by an email from another Apple employee.", "Last, the Commission refers to recital 437 of the contested decision, which contains the statement of an Apple employee describing, from a commercial point of view, a switch to an Intel chipset as untenable, given the payments concerned, and also refers to a statement contained in Apple’s comments on the applicant’s reply to the statement of objections.", "In the view of the Commission, the applicant’s arguments concerning Intel’s chipset scheduling are therefore irrelevant and, in any event, erroneous.", "438 The Commission adds that the report submitted by the applicant as an annex to its reply to the statement of objections is based on tests conducted on chipsets used in other manufacturers’ devices and that its conclusions are therefore not surprising.", "Furthermore, the applicant fails to explain why the Commission’s interpretation of the Apple employee email referred to in recital 437 of the contested decision is inaccurate and does not call into question Apple’s statement relied on in the defence.", "In addition, in the Commission’s view, the applicant’s arguments are repudiated by its own evidence in the FTC proceedings.", "439 It must be recalled that, as is apparent from paragraphs 392 to 394 above, Section 11.4.2 of the contested decision seeks to demonstrate that, according to the Commission, Apple’s internal documents and explanations confirm that the payments concerned actually reduced Apple’s incentives to switch to the applicant’s competitors in order to source LTE chipsets specifically as regards its requirements for some of its devices.", "As the Commission expressly confirmed before the Court, that demonstration concerns the ‘actual effects’ of the payments concerned in relation to those devices.", "440 In other words, that section seeks to confirm that the payments concerned could have anticompetitive effects by demonstrating their actual effects in relation to certain devices.", "441 In particular, as regards Apple’s demand covered by the Commission’s analysis in Section 11.4.2 of the contested decision, it should be recalled that that section refers only to the alleged actual effects of the payments concerned in relation to certain non-CDMA versions of certain iPad models which were ‘launched’ or ‘which were to be launched’ in 2014 and 2015.", "However, that section does not refer to other iPads which were ‘launched’ or ‘which were to be launched’ during the period concerned.", "442 At the outset, it should be noted that such a specific demonstration of the alleged actual effects of the payments concerned, limited to certain versions of iPad 2014 and 2015 models, cannot remedy the failure to take account of all the relevant factual circumstances in the Commission’s general demonstration, which has been examined in the examination of the first complaint in the third part of the third plea, of the capability of the payments concerned to have anticompetitive effects during the period concerned in relation to all of Apple’s LTE chipset requirements for both iPhones and iPads.", "443 In other words, even if the second and third complaints in the third part of the third plea in the action were unfounded and the analysis in Section 11.4.2 of the contested decision were not therefore undermined, that section, given that its scope is limited to certain 2014 and 2015 iPads, cannot validly support the conclusion reached in the contested decision regarding the anticompetitive nature of the payments concerned during the whole of the period concerned in relation to all of Apple’s LTE chipset requirements for both iPhones and iPads.", "444 It is therefore for the sake of completeness that, in the circumstances of the present case, the substance of that section is to be examined and therefore whether, as the applicant disputes, the Commission has not properly demonstrated the actual effects of the payments concerned on Apple’s incentives to switch to the applicant’s competitors for the iPad models covered by that section.", "445 In the present case, the second and third complaints in the third part of the third plea each comprise, in essence, three sub-complaints, concerning (i) the identification of the devices examined in Section 11.4.2 of the contested decision, (ii) the evidence taken into account by the Commission in that section, and (iii) the failure to take account of other relevant factors.", "446 In the circumstances of the present case, initially, the first sub-complaint will be examined, then the third sub-complaint and, last, the second sub-complaint, in the light of the case-law referred to in paragraphs 357 to 359 above.", "(b) The first sub-complaint, concerning devices covered by Section 11.4.2 of the contested decision", "447 The applicant submits, in essence, as a preliminary point, that the Commission has failed to specify the devices to which its analysis relates.", "That complaint aligns with the first complaint in the third part of the third plea, in which the applicant stated that the Commission’s reasoning was imprecise, in that it referred generically to ‘devices’ and erroneously referred to the ‘[confidential] iPad’ as the ‘[confidential]’.", "448 In that regard, as a preliminary point, it should be recalled that Section 11.4.2 of the contested decision comprises four parts: the first (11.4.2.1) contains the analysis of Apple’s internal documents and explanations which resulted in the Commission concluding that the payments concerned actually reduced Apple’s incentives to switch to competing suppliers, while the last three (11.4.2.2, 11.4.2.3 and 11.4.2.4), in essence, are limited to addressing arguments of the applicant which do not affect that conclusion (see recital 423 of the contested decision and paragraph 387 above).", "449 First of all, Section 11.4.2.1 of the contested decision comprises recitals 424 to 439 of that decision and, as is apparent from recital 424, seeks to demonstrate that the payments concerned reduced Apple’s incentives to switch to the applicant’s competitors, in particular Intel, whose chipsets had been evaluated seriously by Apple in order to be used in ‘devices launched in 2014 and 2015’.", "450 In the body of that section, the Commission no longer refers to such devices but rather to the evidence referring to ‘non-CDMA iPad models’ (recital 425 of the contested decision), to the ‘launch in 2014 of the non-CDMA versions of iPads’ (recital 426 of the contested decision), to ‘2014 mobile devices’ (recital 427 of the contested decision), to ‘[confidential]’ and ‘[confidential]’ (recital 428 of the contested decision), to ‘some of its iPads in 2014 and the entirety of its cellular iPad portfolio in 2015’ (recital 430 of the contested decision), to ‘the 2014 and 2015 iPad models as well as the 2015 iPhone model’ (recital 431 of the contested decision), to ‘[confidential] originally planned for launch in spring 2014’ and ‘finally launched in Autumn 2013’ (recital 433 of and footnote 558 to the contested decision), to ‘2014 and 2015 mobile devices’ (recital 435 of the contested decision), to ‘the [a]utumn 2015 iPad model’ (recital 436 of the contested decision), to ‘launch of an iPad … in 2015’ (recital 437 of the contested decision), to ‘Apple’s non-CDMA baseband chipset needs’ (recital 438 of the contested decision), to ‘2015 device models’ and the ‘fall 2015 lineup of mobile devices’ (recital 439 of the contested decision).", "It must therefore be held that the Commission was not consistent in its description of the devices and the periods referred to by the evidence relied on.", "451 Next, as regards Sections 11.4.2.2 and 11.4.2.3 of the contested decision, they are intended to respond to the applicant’s arguments seeking, first, to challenge the reliability of Apple’s internal documents and explanations and, second, to maintain that exclusivity had been requested by Apple.", "452 In the first of those sections, the Commission referred both to ‘devices launched in 2014 and 2015’ (recital 442 of the contested decision) and to ‘devices to be launched in 2014’ (recital 445 of the contested decision) and, in a single sentence, to ‘devices to be launched in 2015’ and to ‘devices launched in 2015’ (recital 446 of the contested decision).", "453 Last, as regards Section 11.4.2.4 of the contested decision, responding to the applicant’s arguments that Apple would, in any event, have selected to obtain supplies from the applicant given the superiority of its chipsets (recital 423 of the contested decision), the Commission concluded that the payments concerned had had an impact on Apple’s sourcing strategy for ‘devices to be launched in 2014 and 2015’ (recital 451 of the contested decision).", "454 While in the body of that section the Commission referred to ‘devices to be launched in 2014 and 2015’ (recital 455 of the contested decision) and to ‘iPads to be launched in 2014 and 2015’ (recital 464 of the contested decision), it referred a number of times to ‘devices launched in 2014 and 2015’ (recitals 456 to 458, 462 and 463 of the contested decision) and to ‘the CDMA version of the iPhone 4 that was launched in February 2011’ (recital 460 of the contested decision) and to ‘[confidential]’ (recital 465 of the contested decision).", "455 It follows from the foregoing that, in Section 11.4.2 of the contested decision, the Commission put forward general reasoning concerning, and addressing together, on some occasions ‘devices’ and on other occasions ‘iPads’, identified variously as, inter alia, those from ‘2014 and 2015’, those ‘launched in 2014 and 2015’ or those ‘to be launched in 2014 and 2015’, without specifying the scope of those expressions or explaining how they were related.", "456 In particular, in recital 424 of the contested decision, in setting out the conclusion drawn from Section 11.4.2.1 of that decision, the Commission referred to devices ‘launched’ in 2014 and 2015, whereas, in recital 451 of that decision, in setting out the conclusion drawn from Section 11.4.2.4 of that decision, the Commission referred to devices ‘to be launched’ in 2014 and 2015.", "However, in the body of each of those sections, the Commission also referred to other devices, the wording of which does not correspond to the devices covered by its demonstration.", "457 It is true that, in the defence, and in response to the measures of organisation of procedure, the Commission stated that the demonstration of the actual effects of the payments concerned, contained in Section 11.4.2 of the contested decision, not only did not concern iPhones, but concerned only certain ‘non-CDMA’ iPad models which ‘were to be launched’ in 2014 and 2015, and not the iPads actually ‘launched’ in 2014 and 2015, the Commission regretting any misunderstanding caused by that ‘clerical error’.", "458 However, contrary to the Commission’s suggestion, the erroneous identification of the devices referred to in the demonstration of the actual effects of the payments concerned cannot be regarded as a mere ‘clerical error’.", "Thus, in particular, the [confidential] model identified by the acronym ‘ [confidential]’ referred to in recitals 433 and 465 of the contested decision corresponds, from a commercial point of view, to the ‘[confidential]’ model and that model, as the Commission itself states in the contested decision, was ‘launched’ in autumn 2013.", "Since that model was ‘launched’ in 2013, it is irrelevant to a demonstration such as that contained in Section 11.4.2.1 of the contested decision which seeks to examine the actual effects of the payments concerned on the models ‘launched’ in 2014 and 2015.", "459 In addition, it must be recalled that the review of legality under Article 263 TFEU relates to the contested act and not to the content of the pleadings lodged by the defendant before the EU Courts (see, to that effect, judgment of 25 July 2018, Orange Polska v Commission, C‑123/16 P, EU:C:2018:590, paragraph 85).", "460 Furthermore, in that latter regard, the Commission’s argument that the applicant was aware of the devices for which Apple intended to obtain supplies from Intel is irrelevant, since, as is apparent from paragraph 459 above, the Court’s review relates to the content of the contested decision.", "Moreover, having regard to the terms used in the contested decision, the applicant found it necessary to challenge the Commission’s reasoning in respect of both devices ‘launched’ and those ‘to be launched’ (paragraph 430 above).", "461 Last, it must be stated that, in the absence of any details in that regard in the contested decision, it is not for the Court to determine, after the event, the devices covered by each of the terms used by the Commission in each recital in Section 11.4.2 of the contested decision.", "462 It must therefore be held that the evidence on which the Commission relied in support of its findings in Section 11.4.2 of the contested decision is inconsistent, both internally within such evidence and in relation to the findings which it seeks to support in Sections 11.4.2.1, 11.4.2.2 and 11.4.2.4 of that decision, which, moreover, has an effect on the internal consistency of Section 11.4.2 of that decision.", "463 It follows that the Commission’s assessment in Section 11.4.2 of the contested decision of the actual anticompetitive effects of the payments concerned, that is to say, having actually reduced Apple’s incentives to switch to competing LTE chipset providers for certain devices, is vitiated by a lack of consistency in the evidence relied on in support of its findings.", "(c) The third sub-complaint, concerning the failure to take account of certain relevant evidence in the demonstration in Section 11.4.2 of the contested decision", "464 The applicant submits, in essence, that Intel’s chipsets had not been selected by Apple because they failed to comply with Apple’s technical and schedule requirements for those devices, and not because of the payments concerned, a fact which the Commission failed to take into account.", "465 In that regard, while the contested decision already suffers from a lack of consistency noted in the context of the first sub-complaint (see paragraph 463 above), it is necessary to ascertain whether, in addition, the Commission took account in its analysis of all the relevant factors which had to be considered.", "To that end, it is appropriate to continue the analysis on the assumption that, as the Commission stated in the defence and at the hearing, the devices covered by that analysis were the ‘non-CDMA’ versions of the ‘[confidential]’ (or ‘[confidential]’) 2014 model and the ‘[confidential]’ and ‘[confidential]’ 2015 models (‘the models allegedly concerned’), there being no need to address further the question whether those devices are identified clearly and unequivocally in the contested decision.", "466 At the outset, it must be stated that the question whether LTE chipsets of the applicant’s competitors were genuinely capable of meeting Apple’s technical and schedule requirements for the models allegedly concerned is, in the circumstances of the present case, a relevant factor to be taken into account when analysing the actual effects of the payments concerned on Apple’s sourcing decisions for its LTE chipset requirements for the models allegedly concerned.", "If, as the applicant submits, Apple had no technical or schedule-related alternative to the applicant’s LTE chipsets for the models allegedly concerned, such a circumstance necessarily had an impact on its sourcing decisions for those models and accordingly on the possible effects of the payments concerned on such decisions.", "467 The evidence relied on by the applicant gives rise to doubts in that regard.", "468 First, as regards the model allegedly concerned which was to ‘be launched’ in 2014, identified by the acronym ‘[confidential]’, as the applicant points out, it is apparent from the evidence submitted that the development of the Intel chipset ([confidential]) which Apple had considered for possible use in the ‘[confidential]’ model was [confidential].", "469 In particular, Apple’s internal presentation of [confidential], which the Commission mentions in footnote 612 to the contested decision relating to recital 464 of that decision, states [confidential].", "470 The further evidence of 26 July 2019 supports those findings. An internal Apple email of [confidential] states, as regards the use of the [confidential] chipset for the iPad planned for [confidential], namely the ‘[confidential]’ model, that [confidential] and that [confidential].", "Another internal Apple email of [confidential] reveals that that chipset was [confidential] and that, if [confidential].", "471 Furthermore, in so far as Apple planned to launch iPad models other than the ‘[confidential]’ model in 2014, it must be observed that, in any event, the documents in the file disclose that the chipsets of the applicant’s competitors did not meet Apple’s technical and scheduling requirements.", "Accordingly, the table entitled [confidential] relating to 2014, which was attached to an internal Apple email of [confidential], shows that the chipsets of the applicant’s competitors, and in particular those of Intel, did not fully satisfy Apple’s technical or scheduling requirements, as is apparent from [confidential].", "472 In particular, as the Commission moreover confirmed in response to the measures of organisation of procedure, the Intel chipset which had been envisaged for the ‘[confidential]’ model [confidential] met ‘in part’ the ‘Apple requirement[s]’, the missing characteristic being related to the absence of [confidential] technology.", "In that regard, it is sufficient to note that an internal Apple email of [confidential], the subject matter of which was [confidential], states, in essence, that [confidential], that, however, [confidential] and that, in that new context, [confidential].", "From that point of view, an internal Apple email of [confidential] refers to a [confidential]. Moreover, the significance of that technology for the other iPads which Apple intended to launch in 2014 cannot be called into question by the Commission’s arguments based on the statements of Apple employees concerning the ‘[confidential]’ model or relating to the prevailing situation when that technology had not become important, since such arguments are irrelevant.", "473 Second, as regards the models allegedly concerned which were ‘to be launched’ in 2015, as the applicant points out, it is apparent from the documents in the file that the chipsets of the applicant’s competitors, and in particular Intel’s chipsets which Apple had contemplated for possible use in the iPads which it planned to launch in 2015, did not satisfy Apple’s technical and scheduling requirements.", "474 First, the applicant relied on the table entitled [confidential] concerning 2015, which was annexed to an internal Apple email of [confidential].", "That table shows that Intel’s chipsets did not satisfy fully Apple’s technical and scheduling requirements, as is apparent from [confidential].", "475 Second, it should be noted that, in the exchange of internal Apple emails dated 18 February 2014 which followed the internal Apple email referred to in recital 436 of the contested decision and the content of which was disclosed as part of the further evidence of 26 July 2019, two Apple engineers stated that the Intel chipset envisaged for an iPad to be launched in autumn 2015 was ‘not quite’ at feature parity with the applicant’s chipset.", "It should be observed that those two engineers stated that that difference resulted from the absence, for Intel’s chipset, of technology [confidential], which was regarded as being [confidential].", "476 It follows from the foregoing that a number of factual elements which were available to the Commission, which were confirmed, moreover, by the evidence submitted, give rise to doubts as to the ability of Intel’s chipsets, or those of other competitors of the applicant, to comply with Apple’s technical and scheduling requirements for the models allegedly concerned and, where relevant, for the other iPad models which Apple intended to launch over that period.", "477 The Commission could not legitimately come to the conclusion that the payments concerned had actually reduced Apple’s incentives to switch to competing LTE chipset suppliers without taking account of the fact that, for Apple’s requirements for the models allegedly concerned, there was no technical or schedule-related alternative to the applicant’s chipsets.", "478 It is true that, in recital 464 of the contested decision, the Commission stated that Apple had envisaged using Intel’s chipsets for the ‘iPads to be launched in 2014 and 2015 taking into account all parameters, not just technical superiority, and including the specific requirements for those devices’ and thus found that Intel was not less attractive than the applicant, at least for those models.", "However, the scope of that assertion by the Commission is not clear from its wording, as regards, in particular, that ‘technical superiority’.", "479 In addition, even if that assertion were to be understood as meaning that, according to the Commission, Intel’s LTE chipsets were a viable alternative for the models allegedly concerned, both technically and as regards scheduling, it must be observed that, in support of that assessment, in footnote 612 to the contested decision relating to recital 464 of that decision, the Commission merely referred, by way of example, to three internal Apple documents which did not, however, make it possible to conclude that Intel’s chipsets satisfied Apple’s technical or scheduling requirements for the models allegedly concerned.", "The first document, to which the Commission refers, mentioning only its cover page, is a presentation by Apple [confidential] referring rather to the [confidential] of Intel’s chipsets (see also, in that regard, paragraph 469 above); the second document is an internal Apple email of October 2012, also referred to in recital 433 of the contested decision, although admittedly stating that Intel would have been a ‘good plan’ for the ‘[confidential]’ model, but contains no indication as to the feasibility of such a ‘plan’ in terms of timing; and the third document is an internal Apple email of June 2012, also referred to in recital 428 of the contested decision, referring to an Intel proposal which was not satisfactory in terms of price.", "Accordingly, not only is the Commission’s assertion that Intel was no less attractive than the applicant for the models allegedly concerned not supported by those three documents, but it does not make it possible to conclude that Apple could actually have obtained supplies from the applicant’s competitors for the models allegedly concerned given its technical and scheduling requirements.", "480 It must therefore be held that, in Section 11.4.2 of the contested decision, the Commission did not carry out a true examination of the existence of competing LTE chipset suppliers from whom Apple could have obtained supplies for the models allegedly concerned given its technical requirements, including scheduling requirements.", "481 It follows that the Commission’s assessment in Section 11.4.2 of the contested decision of the actual anticompetitive effects of the payments concerned, that is to say, having reduced Apple’s incentives to switch to competing LTE chipset suppliers for the models allegedly concerned, was not carried out in the light of all the relevant evidence which had to be taken into consideration.", "(d) The second sub-complaint, concerning the evidence taken into account in the demonstration in Section 11.4.2 of the contested decision", "482 The applicant submits, in essence, that the Commission has not proved that, for the devices covered by its analysis, the payments concerned reduced Apple’s incentives to obtain supplies from its competitors.", "483 In that regard, while the contested decision already suffers from a lack of consistency noted in relation to the first sub-complaint (see paragraph 463 above) and a failure to take account of all the relevant factors noted in relation to the third sub-complaint (see paragraph 481 above), it is necessary to examine whether, additionally, the evidence relied on by the Commission is capable of substantiating the conclusions drawn from it regarding the models allegedly concerned.", "484 As a preliminary point, first, it should be noted that, with the exception of the ‘[confidential]’ model, none of the models allegedly concerned is mentioned expressly in Section 11.4.2 of the contested decision.", "It is apparent from that section that the Commission did not carry out a specific demonstration for each model concerned, but rather provided a general demonstration designed to cover all iPads ‘launched’ or ‘to be launched’ in 2014 and 2015, on some occasions examining the two years together.", "485 Second, it must be observed that, in Section 11.4.2 of the contested decision, the Commission relied, in essence, on evidence from Apple, since Section 11.4.2.1 of that decision is founded exclusively on Apple’s response to question [confidential] of the information request of [confidential] and on internal Apple documents annexed to that response.", "486 In the first place, as regards the model concerned which was ‘to be launched’ in 2014, namely, according to the Commission, the model identified by the acronym ‘[confidential]’ (or ‘[confidential]’), as is apparent from the contested decision and as the Commission explained in its defence, recitals 428 to 435 of the decision contain the demonstration of the alleged effects of the payments concerned on Apple’s decision to purchase LTE chipsets.", "487 First, in that regard, it must be stated that in recitals 425 to 433 of the contested decision the Commission, in essence, highlighted the evidence demonstrating, in its view, that, before concluding the first amendment to the transition agreement, Apple had envisaged switching to the applicant’s competitors for the models allegedly concerned and that that could be of interest to Apple from an economic point of view since ‘the long-term savings opportunity outweigh[ed] the [transition agreement] payment’.", "488 Accordingly, while it is true that the assessments in recitals 425 to 433 of the contested decision show that Apple had taken account of the existence of payments stemming from the transition agreement, they do not indicate that the payments concerned resulting from the transition agreement had actually reduced Apple’s incentives to switch to the applicant’s competitors for the models allegedly concerned, and in particular for the ‘[confidential]’ model.", "489 As is apparent from recitals 434 and 435 of the contested decision, the Commission found that the first amendment to the transition agreement explained why Apple had ceased to take competing suppliers into consideration for the models allegedly concerned which it planned to launch in 2014 and 2015.", "490 Consequently, contrary to the Commission’s assertion, it is not apparent from the contested decision that the transition agreement had, in itself, actually reduced Apple’s incentives to switch to the applicant’s competitors for the models allegedly concerned.", "491 Second, it must be noted that the assessment in recital 435 of the contested decision that, ‘as a result of the [first amendment to the transition agreement], Apple “ceased all consideration of alternative baseband chipset vendors to Qualcomm for 2014 and 2015 mobile devices”’, is founded exclusively on a statement in Apple’s response to question [confidential] of the information request of [confidential].", "492 It must be stated that that response does not concern the ‘[confidential]’ model (or ‘[confidential]’), which, according to the Commission, is the only model allegedly concerned for 2014 referred to in Section 11.4.2 of the contested decision.", "As regards the 2014 non-CDMA models, that response refers only to the [confidential] models. In addition, Apple’s statement reproduced in recital 435 of the contested decision comes from the part of its response concerning those two latter models.", "That statement therefore appears to be of no relevance from the point of view of the demonstration in the contested decision concerning the ‘[confidential]’ model.", "493 Third, it should be noted that, in recital 465 of the contested decision, in the context of Section 11.4.2.4 of that decision, the Commission stated [confidential] and, to that end, relied on two statements made by Apple, taken from the third indent of paragraph 52 of its comments on the applicant’s response to the statement of objections.", "494 However, as the applicant correctly points out, those statements do not indicate [confidential] because of the payments concerned.", "In particular, those statements provide no indication as to why [confidential]. In the absence of conclusive evidence adduced by the Commission in the contested decision, it is not for the Court to determine the reasons which resulted in [confidential].", "495 In the second place, as regards the models allegedly concerned which Apple planned to launch in 2015, namely, according to the Commission, the ‘[confidential]’ and ‘[confidential]’ models, as is apparent from the contested decision and as the Commission explained in its defence, the demonstration of the alleged effects of the payments concerned is founded on the evidence referred to in recitals 436 and 437 of the contested decision.", "496 As a preliminary point, in so far as Apple’s statement reproduced in recital 435 of the contested decision generally refers to ‘2014 and 2015 mobile devices’ jointly, it is sufficient to recall that that statement was made in relation to certain 2014 iPad models other than ‘[confidential]’ (paragraph 492 above).", "The relevance of that statement to the 2015 models allegedly concerned has therefore also not been established.", "497 First, in recital 436 of the contested decision, the Commission relied on an internal Apple document containing an internal email exchange dated 18 February 2014, stating that an Apple engineer had suggested using Intel’s chipset for an iPad ‘fall 2015’ model since it had ‘feature parity’ with the applicant’s chipset.", "498 On the one hand, neither recital 436 of the contested decision nor that exchange of internal emails specify the iPad model which Apple planned to launch in 2015 and which is covered by the Apple engineer’s assertion.", "On the other hand, in the context of the further evidence of 26 July 2019, the applicant produced another exchange of internal Apple emails of the same date, which show that the assertion by the Apple employee set out in recital 436 of the contested decision had in fact been challenged by the head of Apple’s engineering team.", "The latter, in response, had stated that Intel’s chipset ‘[was] not quite at feature parity’ with the applicant’s chipset, the word ‘not’ being written in capital letters in that internal email.", "In addition, that assessment was confirmed by another Apple employee in the same email exchange.", "499 Those factors therefore call into question the substance of the assessment in recital 436 of the contested decision, since that assessment is founded on a single internal Apple email which is contradicted by two others.", "500 Second, in recital 437 of the contested decision, the Commission refers to an exchange of internal Apple emails dated 20 February 2014, responding to the internal email referred to in recital 436 of that decision, in which (i) an Apple employee states that another employee had ‘some commercial penalty concerns regarding timing’ concerning the launch of an iPad incorporating another supplier’s chipset and (ii) the latter employee confirms that such a launch was ‘commercially untenable’.", "501 However, it must be stated that those emails and recital 437 of the contested decision make no specific reference to any iPad model or to the payments and agreements concerned.", "There is therefore no basis for concluding with certainty that those internal emails referred to the loss and reimbursement of the payments concerned.", "502 Furthermore, in so far as the Commission, in its defence, relied on a statement made by Apple in its comments on the applicant’s reply to the statement of objections in order to establish a link between those internal emails and the payments concerned, it must be stated that that statement does not appear in recital 437 of the contested decision and, moreover, does not relate to the internal emails referred to in that recital.", "503 Third, moreover, in recital 438 of the contested decision, the Commission referred to an economic analysis by Apple’s procurement team dated 29 January 2014, concerning the economic impact of a switch of supplier in 2015 for non-CDMA chipset requirements, submitted by Apple in its reply to question [confidential] of the information request of [confidential].", "504 In that regard, suffice it to state that, as Apple explains in its reply to question [confidential] of the information request of [confidential], that economic analysis ‘did not form the basis for any procurement decisions by Apple management’, with the result that, regardless of the reasons why Apple’s management did not rely on such an analysis, which it is not for the Court to establish, that economic analysis does not make it possible to draw any conclusion regarding the effects which the payments concerned actually had on Apple’s LTE chipset sourcing decisions.", "505 It follows that the Commission, in Section 11.4.2 of the contested decision, in the context of a general analysis mixing models and years, relied on evidence which is not relevant, which is contradicted by other evidence or which is not capable of substantiating its conclusions in relation to the models allegedly concerned and which, therefore, does not make it possible to demonstrate that the payments concerned actually reduced Apple’s incentives to switch to the applicant’s competitors to obtain supplies of LTE chipsets for those models.", "506 It follows from all of the foregoing, first, that Section 11.4.2 of the contested decision cannot remedy the unlawfulness found as a result of the examination of the first complaint in the third part of the third plea (paragraphs 442 and 443 above) and, second, that, in any event, in Section 11.4.2 of the contested decision, the Commission did not provide an analysis which makes it possible to support the finding that the payments concerned had actually reduced Apple’s incentives to switch to the applicant’s competitors in order to obtain supplies of LTE chipsets for the non-CDMA iPad models allegedly concerned which Apple intended to launch in 2014 and 2015.", "507 The Commission reached such a conclusion following reasoning which (i) is vitiated by a lack of consistency in the evidence relied on in support of its findings (paragraph 463 above); (ii) was, moreover, carried out without taking account of all the relevant factors for that purpose (paragraph 481 above); and (iii) was, in addition, carried out relying on evidence which did not make it possible to support its findings (paragraph 505 above).", "508 Consequently, the Commission’s finding that the payments concerned actually had anticompetitive effects bearing out their capability to produce such effects is unlawful.", "509 Moreover, for those same reasons, and contrary to the Commission’s assertions, the reasoning in Section 11.4.2 of the contested decision also fails to demonstrate, in the alternative, that the payments concerned were capable of having anticompetitive effects in relation to the models allegedly concerned.", "In any event, even if that were the case, it should be recalled that the theory of harm adopted in the contested decision does not relate to the anticompetitive capability of the payments concerned being limited to Apple’s requirements for solely the models allegedly concerned, but rather covers all of Apple’s requirements during the period concerned for both iPhones and iPads (see paragraphs 420, 442 and 443 above).", "510 In the light of all of the foregoing, the second and third complaints in the third part of the third plea in the action must be upheld.", "511 It follows from the examination of the first, second and third complaints in the third part of the third plea, there being no need to examine the other complaints in that part of the plea, that characterising the payments concerned as constituting an abuse of a dominant position is unlawful, in that, first, the examination of the capability of the payments concerned to have anticompetitive effects is founded on an analysis which was not carried out in the light of all the relevant factual circumstances and, second, the examination of the actual effects of the payments concerned is founded on an analysis which does not make it possible to support the findings made by the Commission.", "512 On those grounds, in view of the unlawfulness established in the examination of the third part of the third plea, and there being no need to give a ruling on the other parts raised by the applicant, the third plea in the action must be upheld and, on that basis also, the contested decision must be set aside.", "513 Since the first plea (first and third parts) and the third plea in the action (third part) have been upheld, the contested decision must be set aside, there being no need to give a ruling on the other pleas in the action, or on the requests for measures of organisation of procedure or measures of inquiry submitted by the applicant in so far as those requests go beyond the measures decided upon or ordered by the Court, or on additional evidence other than the further evidence of 26 July 2019.", "514 Under Article 134(1) of the Rules of Procedure, the unsuccessful party is to be ordered to pay the costs if they have been applied for in the successful party’s pleadings.", "515 Since the Commission has been unsuccessful, it must be ordered to bear its own costs and to pay those of the applicant, in accordance with the form of order sought by the applicant.", "THE GENERAL COURT (Sixth Chamber, Extended Composition)", "1. Sets aside Commission Decision C(2018) 240 final of 24 January 2018 relating to proceedings under Article 102 [TFEU] and Article 54 of the [EEA Agreement] (Case AT.40220 – Qualcomm (Exclusivity payments));", "2.

We currently have 13 attaché positions in 10 cities, including three based in China.", "IP attachés are IP experts who serve as U.S. diplomats in Embassies and Consulates abroad. IP attachés promote U.S. IP policies to achieve high-quality and balanced IP systems, including effective protection and enforcement, in their host countries and regions.", "The IP attachés work closely with the USPTO and the Office of Intellectual Property Rights (OIPR) in advancing the commercial interests of U.S. companies in foreign markets where they are experiencing barriers to market access.", "China’s experience in IP-related issues has deeply informed its perspective on antitrust issues generally.", "Certain of China’s highest profile cases in recent years have involved IP. There are also jurisdictional, agency, and legislative overlaps between IP and antitrust.", "To name a few examples: China’s specialized IP tribunals and courts handle antitrust litigation. China’s State Administration for Industry and Commerce, which houses a bureau that handles non-price-related abuse-of-dominance cases, in addition to trade secrets and trade dress matters and also has bureaus that administer trademarks, trademark enforcement, trademark agency appeals and company name registrations among other areas.", "The former Minister of Commerce Director General, who handled mergers, was in charge of IP matters when he was the Director General of Law and Treaties at the Ministry of Commerce.", "Many of China’s antitrust related laws also build upon pre-existing laws, regulations, and rules, some of which have significant IP components.", "These laws include the Anti-Unfair Competition Law, which contains measures to protect trade secrets and trade dress, and the Contract Law, which also addresses the “monopolization of technology.”", "The paradox China presents, from a USPTO perspective, is the combination of weak and non-deterrent IP protection with strong antitrust enforcement with potentially high penalties that has recently focused on IP, including on IP held by U.S. companies.", "As USTR noted in its 2015 report on China’s WTO compliance, “inadequacies in China’s IPR protection and enforcement regime continue to present serious barriers to U.S. exports and investment.”", "In a recent survey, U.S.-China Business Council respondents listed IP concerns in a number four priority slot in a list of the top 10 challenges for members with respect to business performance in China.", "IP issues have averaged as a number 4.5 priority over the past ten years. According to AmCham Shanghai’s 2016 China Business Report, 49% of respondents believed that lack of IPR protection and enforcement constrains their investment in innovation and R&D in China.", "Concerns about IP are based on the U.S. perception that these are our competitive advantages in China.", "When AmCham China respondents in all sectors addressed what they considered their competitive advantage versus Chinese domestic entities, three of their top four perceived advantages were IP-related: Brands (74%), Technology & IP (63%), and Development and Innovation (59%).", "Broadly speaking, the current environment for IP and antitrust in China shows three clear trends: strong antitrust enforcement balanced against weak IP rights for deterring infringement; pursuit of foreigners in antitrust, with little foreign affirmative use of the IP system; and, a legal and industrial policy environment where it is very difficult to legitimately license patents to third parties.", "1. Strong Antitrust Enforcement/Weak IP Enforcement", "Chinese patent damages are too low. IP holders who run afoul of Chinese AML authorities, and may potentially pay significant fines, do not have comfort that their legitimate IP rights have been or will be protected.", "For example, one antitrust/IP related administrative penalty for a completed investigation to date is the antitrust fine imposed against Qualcomm for $975 million USD by China’s National Reform and Development Commission (China’s former State Planning Commission) (March 2, 2015).", "By comparison, according to one database, Ciela.cn, the average damages in a Chinese patent case is as low as CNY 118,266 , or about $18,000 USD.", "A recent report by a newer database service, IPHouse, determined that the average compensation in a patent infringement matter in Beijing for 2015 was 460,418 RMB or about $74,260.", "By comparison, the Qualcomm fine was over 50,000 times the average patent damage award as calculated by CIELA, or about 13,000 times the IPHouse report.", "It is also about 20 times higher than the highest patent damage award, $45,000,000 USD in a first instance trial against Schneider Electric, which many view as an outlier, in terms of the high damages that were awarded.", "Of course, antitrust and IP infringement cases seek to remedy different harms, and penalties in these matters are calculated differently.", "That said, in the area of IP, there is an international obligation, under the TRIPS Agreement, for courts to award damages sufficient to deter further infringements (Art.", "2. IP-related Antitrust Activities Against Foreigners for Asserting IP Rights and Weak Foreign Utilization of the IP System", "Chinese antitrust authorities have taken pains to indicate that they are enforcing their antitrust laws even-handedly.", "Nonetheless, many U.S. tech companies have been the subject of antitrust enforcement for their IP-related practices including licensing, such as Qualcomm, InterDigital, Microsoft, Dolby and HDMI.", "IP issues have also appeared in Chinese merger decisions, including Google-Motorola, Microsoft-Nokia, and Coca Cola-Huiyuan.", "Press reports and survey data suggest that many foreign companies feel targeted. U.S.-China Business Council survey data presents a severe picture for foreigners in antitrust matters: 86 percent of companies surveyed said they were concerned about China’s competition enforcement activities, and nearly 30 percent said they were concerned that they would be targeted by future investigations.", "Recently released data from China’s Supreme People’s Court reporting on IP litigation for 2015 reveals that the total number of civil IP cases in China involving foreigners, as calculated by the Court, was only 1.3% of China’s IP docket, or 1,327 cases in 2015.", "Foreign IP cases dropped 23% in absolute numbers from last year, despite an overall increase of 7.2% of total decided IP cases.", "Concerns over targeting may also stem in part from the perceived bias within the Chinese system. In the Huawei vs InterDigital case, QIU Yongqing, the chief judge who ruled against U.S. based InterDigital, stated that Huawei’s strategy of using anti-monopoly laws as a countermeasure is worth learning by other Chinese enterprises: and that “Chinese enterprises should bravely employ anti-monopoly lawsuits to break technology barriers and win space for development.”", "James M. Zimmerman, the current Chairman of AmCham China described the environment from a U.S. perspective: “There's the insinuation that foreign company executives will be personally persecuted or prevented from leaving the country…The lack of due process in these investigations is disturbing.”", "Many foreigners also have concerns over retaliation of various kinds if they bring IP lawsuits. For example, several years before the AML was enacted, the State Administration for Industry and Commerce conducted a study which appeared to point to foreign companies, including Cisco, as abusing its dominant position by refusing to license its technology .", "Cisco had sued one of those companies (Huawei) for illegally copying its IP before the SAIC survey was completed.", "There have been several other cases which suggest that there may have been retaliation for bringing Section 337 or other patent litigation matters, or even for seeking settlements of disputes in the U.S. or elsewhere.", "Nonetheless, we lack equivalent data sets on both the IP system and antitrust system at this time to draw comprehensive comparisons.", "In recent years, Chinese IP adjudication has however benefited from initiatives involving publication of all civil and administrative cases, statistical reporting of decisions, annual white papers on developments in agencies and the courts, experiments in developing case law and precedent, experiments in publicly filed amicus briefs, regulations requiring transparent coordination amongst enforcement authorities, and even a WTO request to provide copies of IP cases which are providing an increasingly robust basis for assessing China’s IP system, including, in many cases, its impact on foreigners.", "This experience in IP, in appropriate circumstances, may create useful pathways for China’s antitrust development.", "In its 2015 annual member survey , the U.S.-China Business Council reported that 59% of respondents expressed concern about transferring technology to China.", "Concerns about technology transfer included protection of IP (75%), enforcing license agreements (51%) and the government dictating or influencing licensing negotiations (32%).", "The U.S.-China Business Council noted that the companies impacted by this issue felt it “very acutely.”", "A more recent, unpublished 2016 survey by the US-China Business Council rated China the most challenging legal and regulatory market, ahead of the United States, Europe, developed markets in Asia and other emerging markets.", "These consequences can be especially acute for the United States, which is the world’s largest technology exporter.", "In 2014, the United States exported $130.362 billion dollars of technology. The Chinese market was $6.826 billion, or about 5.2% of that total.", "Ireland, Switzerland, the United Kingdom, Canada and Japan all exceeded China as an export market. Importantly, most of the technology exports to China from the U.S. (about 58%) are between related parties, e.g., between a parent and subsidiary.", "In other words, only about 42% of the technology exports to China are between unrelated parties. By comparison, Taiwan which is a slightly smaller technology market, was dominated by unrelated party transactions with the U.S. (about 93%).", "The above data raise concerns whether China is overly focused on IP abuse, and not sufficiently directed to improving IP use.", "I believe that much of the problem with commercialization of technology today is due to an over-interventionist Chinese economy.", "From a legal perspective, one should not lose sight of the fact that the AML, like many Chinese laws and China’s constitution itself, is intended to promote “the healthy development of the socialist market economy” (Art. 1) which includes China’s state planning apparatus.", "Notwithstanding the international consensus that IP is a “private right” (TRIPS Agreement, preamble), China’s legacy state planning has created a wealth of incentives and intervention in IP creation and licensing, from which it is reasonable to assume antitrust policy is not excluded.", "These polices have the potential to make it difficult for foreigners to license their technology in China.", "Amongst two of the notable socialist market economy goals of China, are the 15 year Science and Technology Plan (2006) which has a goal of reducing “dependence on imported technology reduced to 30% or below” and the “Action Plan for Implementing the National Intellectual Property Strategy (2014—2020)” promulgated by the State Council” which has a goal of increasing technology exports from the $1.3 billion USD in 2013 to $8 billion USD by 2020.", "Regarding policy support for different sectors, NDRC, the antitrust regulator which brought the Qualcomm case and was the former State Planning Commission, drafted a plan in 2014 of “building an innovative platform to promote the development of strategic emerging industries” which includes the IT sector.", "SIPO, through its leadership of the National IP Strategy in 2013, similarly called to “prepare a work plan for intellectual property in China’s Strategic and Emerging Industries.”", "/ The current five year national IP strategy also calls for China to “Strive to Build a Strong IPR Country” and calls for “strengthening patent pilot projects, joint utilization of patents and collective management of patents… to strengthen the competitive advantages of industries.”", "Chinese government interventions include a goal of increasing state support for patents through state funded loans secured by patents to about $30 billion USD by 2020.", "The Chinese government, through its High and New Technology Enterprise tax incentives, also provides tax benefits for companies that locally own IP or conduct R&D. Chinese government interventions in IP creation include national and local quotas for patent creation per 10,000 people, subsidies for patent applications or maintenance, national and local incentives to participate in standards setting bodies, tax preferences for companies which own their own locally-created IP, industry specific plans to obtain additional patents in technologies of concern to China, and talent programs for developing IP talent or talent in industrial sectors.", "The Administration has pushed back on these policies as well as procedural aspects of China’s AML regime, including some of the excessive practices and due process concerns, in our various bilateral dialogues.", "The UPSTO engages on both sides of the balance between IP enforcement and increased antitrust enforcement in China.", "The Agency has a leading role in issues involving patent protection and enforcement and we have long engaged the Chinese government, its courts and the Chinese patent office, on the need for more deterrent and predictable remedies and better civil enforcement of IP rights.", "We advocate on behalf of the U.S. Government through comments on draft laws, in JCCT discussions, and in the context of our direct relationships with China’s patent office and other agencies.", "We also conduct numerous training programs for U.S. industry to better understand China’s IP environment.", "On antitrust matters, we support the efforts of the Department of Commerce and other agencies (including the U.S. antitrust enforcers, USDOJ, FTC, and as well as USTR) in their engagement when such matters implicate IP issues.", "There have been several commitments by China in recent years to improve procedural fairness on antitrust matters which USPTO supports.", "We have also taken a lead on highlighting challenges involved in licensing IP to China, including testimony before the U.S. China Economic and Security Commission , negotiating with our Chinese counterparts, conducting two separate programs with China’s patent office and Ministry of Commerce on licensing regulation, and educating U.S. companies on risks of IP protection and licensing in China’s current environment.", "One such program on China IP issues was held last year in cooperation with the University of California at San Diego.", "Our next program on the Economic Contribution of Technology Licensing, in conjunction with George Mason University, is scheduled for tomorrow, June 8 at USPTO.", "China’s AML was enacted only eight years ago in 2008. But, Chinese regulators benefit from hundreds of years of experience of other governments, and have been engaging in technical dialogues and exchanges with a wide range of agencies, companies and universities.", "Comparisons with intellectual property suggest that arguments regarding China’s developing world status should have a very short life span.", "Although intellectual property appeared a very new concept to China in 1983, by 2011 China had become the most litigious society for intellectual property in the world, with the largest trademark office and one of the two largest patent offices.", "Moreover, this “foreign concept” has taken deep root in China: over 98% of the IPR litigation in China involves Chinese suing Chinese, and many of the key rights (85-98%) granted by China’s IP agencies (trademarks, utility model patents, design patents), are granted to Chinese nationals.", "As with IP, China has now emerged as a major antitrust venue, which has also elicited considerable concern from the business community, and should be engaged accordingly.", "The Administration strongly supports China’s efforts to develop an antitrust regime consistent with the practices of other market-economy countries.", "However, we are concerned that there are many aspects of China’s economy that may not be fully market driven, in the context of both IP and IP-related antitrust."]}

The previous article covered the top four considerations when patenting standardized technologies.", "This article covers the top four considerations when seeking to enforce SEPs, and the third article will cover the top four considerations when defending against SEP attacks.", "Awareness and consideration of numerous recent significant SEP-related court decisions is critical to parties involved with SEP enforcement.", "While the fact that a patented technology is considered essential to an industry standard suggests that infringement of any standard-compliant products may be easier to prove, SEP infringement suits are hardly straightforward.", "There are still various factors to keep in mind when strategizing an infringement suit. In this article, we analyze recent court decisions and statements from government agencies to highlight four key points that SEP holders should keep in mind when seeking to enforce their SEPs.", "SEPs typically implicate a large number of potentially infringing products, including the end products available to the consumer, individual components within the end products and/or platforms or network elements that facilitate the use of end products.", "Thus, SEP patent holders should carefully select the patents that will target the right products, especially for damages and royalty-calculating purposes.", "When considering initiating an infringement suit, SEP holders often seek to first identify which of their patents fully claim the product features that drive sales and capture the most value of the product.", "At the outset, considering how the court may eventually calculate a royalty rate for damages may be helpful.", "While the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit has not provided a bright-line rule for determining a royalty rate, it has stated that “the essential requirement is that the ultimate reasonable royalty award must be based on the incremental value that the patented invention adds to the end product.”[1]", "Typically, courts will calculate a royalty base by using the smallest salable unit,[2] and patentees cannot alternatively calculate damages based on sales of the entire product “without showing that the demand for the entire product is attributable to the patented feature.”[3]", "Thus, sophisticated patentees consider what the smallest salable unit of the infringing product is and which patent best claims that invention.", "In order to maximize potential damages, patentees typically assert the patents that cover the most valuable units of the product.", "It is also worthwhile to note that courts have found the smallest salable unit principle inapplicable where it can instead reference price points from the parties’ actual licensing negotiations.[4] In Commonwealth Scientific & Industrial Research Organisation v. Cisco Systems, Inc., the Federal Circuit found that the district court did not err in valuing the asserted patent with reference to end product licensing negotiations where the court heard evidence of the rates the parties had actually discussed in prior negotiations.[5] Thus, as SEP holders participate in licensing negotiations, they often consider the potential ramifications on future litigation and royalty calculations and are aware of these negotiations when moving forward to enforce a particular SEP in court.", "SEP holders must also be mindful of the specific rules and policies of the relevant standard-setting organizations, especially since many SSOs have rules or guidelines regarding fair, reasonable and nondiscriminatory obligations or factors to consider in calculating royalties.", "For example, the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers notes that determination of reasonable rates should include, but need not be limited to, “the value of the relevant functionality of the smallest saleable Complaint Implementation that practices the Essential Patent Claim.”[6]", "Similarly, one court found that under the applicable law, the intellectual property rights policy for the European Telecommunications Standards Institute did not require a FRAND license to be based on the smallest salable patent practicing unit, thereby enabling the patent owner to argue for a higher royalty rate.[7] Overall, being aware of SSO guidelines helps inform the patentee of any particular FRAND obligations relevant to the patents it may choose to enforce.", "Additionally, SEP holders should be attentive to the development of the standard, as it is possible that the final version of the standard will not read directly on the declared patent, leaving room for potential noninfringement positions for future defendants in litigation.", "Moreover, it is important to remember that many SSOs do not conduct their own assessments as to whether a declared patent is essential to a standard.[8]", "Thus SEP holders need to consider this on their end.", "When considering which potential infringers to target, SEP holders consider parties all along the supply chain, at various levels of implementation, and at different industry applications.", "If it is likely that the patent owner can prove that the patented invention drives demand for the entire accused product, then the patent owner may be able to focus on potential infringers farther down the supply chain.", "Otherwise, the patent owner will need to identify which entity sells the smallest salable patent-practicing unit in order to build up its damages analysis.", "Another factor to consider is patent exhaustion and the potential risk of precluding an infringement case against other players.", "There are multiple advantages to seeking a license from upstream actors, including that it may be easier to demonstrate that the patented feature drives demand or sales and that upstream actors are more likely to have documents that prove infringement.", "However, one major risk is that licensing an SEP to an upstream supplier may limit an SEP holders’ ability to enforce the patent against any downstream players.", "Under the exhaustion doctrine, once a patentee sells one of its products it no longer controls that item through the patent laws, and its patent rights are said to “exhaust.", "”[9] As downstream players are the ones who sell the higher-valued end product, they can provide a better sales figure for the royalty base calculation.", "Consequently, the royalties available from downstream players are usually higher than the royalties available from their upstream counterparts.", "Of course, targeting downstream manufacturers has its own set of challenges. As illustrated in the recent Federal Trade Commision v. Qualcomm Inc. case, SEP holders may be accused of violating FRAND commitments or even antitrust laws if they exclusively to license downstream suppliers and refuse to license to other entities along the supply chain.", "Qualcomm’s licensing strategy included licensing only to original equipment manufacturers that sold the handsets that incorporated the allegedly infringing chips.[10]", "The district court determined that this tactic was anticompetitive and violated Qualcomm’s FRAND obligations; subsequently, it ordered Qualcomm to “make exhaustive SEP licenses available to modem chip suppliers on fair, reasonable, and non-discriminatory (“FRAND”) terms and to submit, as necessary, to arbitral or judicial dispute resolution to determine such terms.", "Qualcomm appealed, and the district court’s injunction was recently stayed pending appeal. Whether Qualcomm’s targeted licensing practices will be tolerated by courts is something SEP holders should keep on their radar.", "Further, SEP holders should consider which players the courts will have jurisdiction over, which may also determine where they choose to file a complaint.", "Where foreign parties are involved, the U.S. International Trade Commission may be a worthwhile option, as it has in rem jurisdiction over accused imported products and thus does not need to have personal jurisdiction over accused manufacturers or meet venue requirements.", "In addition, Section 337 investigations offer exclusion orders as a remedy, providing SEP holders with possible injunctive relief that they would otherwise struggle to obtain from district courts.", "Additionally, SEP holders often consider and implement a global enforcement strategy as different jurisdictions offer different advantages and procedural benefits.", "For example, in Germany, an SEP holder can obtain an injunction if he or she complies with certain minimum requirements regarding its FRAND obligations.[12]", "Alternatively, in comparison to Germany and other foreign jurisdictions that do not conduct extensive pretrial discovery, the U.S. may offer a more attractive fact discovery procedure.", "In anticipation of an infringement suit, SEP holders should be sure to satisfy their FRAND obligations under the relevant SSO standard.", "Typically, this includes negotiating a license in good faith.[13] By being mindful of their FRAND obligations, SEP holders can shield themselves from future breach of contract claims or a defense of patent unenforceability.", "In some instances in which SEP holders have failed to comply with their FRAND commitments, courts have threatened to find their patent unenforceable against certain infringers.", "For example, in Fujitsu Ltd. v. Tellabs Operations Inc., the jury found that Fujitsu had breached its FRAND obligations by failing to offer a reasonable license for its SEPs before suing for injunctive relief.[14] From the jury verdict form, it is clear that in making its decision that Fujitsu breached its agreement, the jury considered the following factors:", "- Fujitsu did not offer to grant Tellabs a license on RAND terms for Fujitsu’s patented technology;", "- Fujitsu filed a lawsuit against Tellabs seeking injunctive relief based upon the alleged infringement of the patent;", "- Fujitsu filed a lawsuit against Tellabs seeking a nonRAND royalty rate based on alleged infringement of the patent;", "- Fujitsu filed a lawsuit against Tellabs seeking damages in the form of lost profits based on alleged infringement of the patent;", "- Fujitsu filed a lawsuit against Tellabs alleging infringement of the patent that damaged Telalb’s business;", "- Fujitsu filed a lawsuit against Tellabs alleging infringement of the patent that required Tellabs to devote management attention and time, as well as other resources to defending the lawsuit, such as attorney fees, expert fees and related costs.[15]", "In light of the jury verdict, the district court ordered Fujitsu to show cause why one of its patents should not be held unenforceable as to Tellabs.", "Alternatively, where SEP holders have been able to show that they did engage in negotiations to license their patents, courts have been satisfied with a good faith standard.", "For example, in HTC Corp., et al, v. Telefonaktiebolaget LM Ericsson, the district court found that to satisfy the FRAND obligations of the French organization ETSI, HTC Corp. needed to either (1) offer a FRAND license or (2) negotiate in good faith towards a FRAND license.[17] Notably, the court did not suggest that HTC needed to have formally offered a FRAND license.", "Additionally, in Realtek Semiconductor Corp. v. LSI Corp., the district court found that LSI violated its contractual obligations to IEEE by instigating an ITC Section 337 action naming Realtek as a respondent prior to offering a RAND license to Realtek.[18]", "Despite evidence of some correspondence between the parties, the court found it did not amount to a RAND offer because the standard referenced in the correspondence was different from the actual standard at issue, the parties ceased communications before any specific offer was actually made, and Realtek continued to sell its product for years without hearing again from LSI.[19]", "These cases illustrate the importance of fulfilling all FRAND obligations in the short term in order to avoid headaches in later litigation.", "By having a thorough short-term strategy for addressing these requirements, SEP holders can later move forward with litigation unencumbered by potential weaknesses in their infringement case.", "In considering a long-term litigation strategy, SEP holders should keep in mind developing case law, including shifting attitudes concerning injunctions in the SEP space.", "After eBay Inc. v. MercExchange LLC, it had been generally understood that injunctions are not a guarantee with a finding of infringement.", "This is especially true for SEPs where FRAND licensing terms suggest a price point for compensating the SEP holder, making it more difficult to show irreparable harm.", "Additionally, previous statements from the Antitrust Division of the U.S. Department of Justice have suggested a hesitation in issuing injunctions.", "In 2013, the DOJ submitted a joint statement with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office that expressed concerns regarding injunctions and exclusion orders, including that the SEP owner may take advantage of its market power by engaging in “patent hold-up,” which could then discourage implementers from committing to standardized technology in order to protect themselves.[20]", "The agencies noted that “[i]n some circumstances, the remedy of an injunction or exclusion order may be inconsistent with the public interest,”[21] and they “recommended caution in granting injunctions or exclusion orders based on infringement of voluntarily F/RAND-encumbered patents essential to a standard[.]”[22]", "However, in December 2018, Assistant Attorney General Makan Delrahim formally withdrew the DOJ’s assent to the statement.[23]", "In a speech to the Berkeley-Stanford Advanced Patent Law Institute, he noted that the statement had not accurately conveyed the Antitrust Division’s position regarding “when and how patent holders should be able to exclude competitors from practicing their technologies” and suggested that the DOJ would be engaging with the USPTO to draft a new statement that would “better provide[] clarity and predictability with respect to the balance of interests at stake when an SEP holder seeks an injunctive order.", "He also disagreed that excluding competitors from using SEP-covered technology is a per se violation of antitrust law, and asserted that such an approach “is wrong as a matter of antitrust law and bad as a matter of innovation policy.", "Interestingly enough, however, the DOJ argued against issuing an “overly broad remedy” in the FTC v. Qualcomm case.", "In a statement of interest submitted to the court, the DOJ urged the court to hold a hearing and order additional briefing to determine a proper remedy “", "[b]ecause an overly broad remedy could result in reduced innovation, with the potential to harm American consumers.", "”[26] The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit later stayed the district court’s injunction.[27]", "The USPTO on the other hand is still mulling over whether to keep the 2013 policy statement. At a recent speech in Belgium, USPTO Director Andrei Iancu said that his office continues to consult government agencies, including the DOJ, and that any new policy regarding injunctions in the SEP space should be “balanced and structured” to promote technological and industrial growth.[28]", "Thus, while still uncertain, the prospect of a shift in attitude towards injunctions in SEP cases is a development worth following.", "SEPs can present unique litigation challenges, especially in light of FRAND obligations. By carefully establishing a presuit strategy, including a careful selection of the patent(s) to assert and the proper jurisdiction for bringing a suit, and a thorough analysis of potential infringers and relevant SSO policies, SEP holders can put themselves in a stronger position for litigation.", "SEP holders must also be mindful of satisfying their good-faith negotiation obligations before bringing an SEP suit so as to avoid unenforceability issues.", "Finally, SEP holders should closely monitor SEP case law, which remains unsettled and is rapidly evolving.", "Ryan Richardson and Michael Specht are directors and Lauren Watt is an associate at Sterne Kessler Goldstein & Fox.", "The opinions expressed are those of the author(s) and do not necessarily reflect the views of the firm, its clients, or Portfolio Media Inc., or any of its or their respective affiliates.", "This article is for general information purposes and is not intended to be and should not be taken as legal advice.", "[1] Ericsson, Inc. v.

As recently as January, Apple CEO Tim Cook said the iPhone maker wasn't in talks with Qualcomm.", "Analysts speculated that Apple's need for 5G chips might have spurred the iPhone maker to negotiate, a view backed up by a Nikkei report that said the company had tested Qualcomm 5G chips as the companies explored a settlement.", "Shortly after the settlement was announced, Intel, an Apple supplier, said it was exiting the 5G phone modem business.", "Neither Apple nor Qualcomm commented beyond their statement.", "The decision set the San Diego courtroom the companies were appearing in abuzz. Apple and its contract manufacturers had presented their opening arguments and a lawyer for Qualcomm had nearly finished when the announcement was made.", "A day earlier, the sides had selected a jury that included a pilot, a retired nurse and a former pitcher for the Kansas City Royals.", "The settlement is the latest twist in a fight that could put your iPhone at risk. San Diego-based Qualcomm supplies network connectivity chips for Apple's iPhones and is the world's biggest provider of mobile chips.", "Its technology is essential for connecting phones to cellular networks. The company derives a significant portion of its revenue from licensing its inventions to hundreds of device makers, with the fee based on the value of the phone, not the components.", "Qualcomm owns patents related to 3G, 4G and 5G phones -- as well as other features like software -- so any handset makers building a device that connects to the networks has to pay it a licensing fee, even if they don't use Qualcomm's chips.", "That includes Apple. The company makes its own applications processor -- the brains of the iPhone -- but it relies on third-party chips for network connectivity.", "From the iPhone 4S in 2011 to the iPhone 6S and 6S Plus in 2015, the sole supplier for those chips was Qualcomm.", "The following year, Apple started using Intel modems in some models of the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus, but it still used Qualcomm in versions for Verizon and Sprint.", "It continued that trend in 2017, but Apple's latest phones -- the iPhone XS, XS Max and XR, only use Intel 4G chips.", "Apple blamed Qualcomm, though Qualcomm said it would like to supply to Apple. Still, Apple's move to 5G could be held up by not working with Qualcomm.", "Hours after Apple and Qualcomm settled, Intel said it was exiting the 5G smartphone modem business.

Qualcomm in July 2017 accused Apple of infringing six non-standard-essential patents, but only three ended up making it to court.", "One patent allows a smartphone to quickly connect to the internet once the device is turned on. Another deals with graphics processing and battery life.", "The third lets apps on your phone download data more easily by directing traffic between the apps processor and the modem.", "A jury ultimately decided that Apple violated all three of Qualcomm's patents and said it should pay the chipmaker $31 million -- or $1.41 per iPhone -- for infringing on its technology.", "The jury awarded Qualcomm the full amount it had requested at the start of the two-week trial, which took place in San Diego.", "The April trial that was just settled was supposed to be the big one. It relates to Apple's initial complaint, in which it sued Qualcomm for allegedly unfair licensing terms.", "Apple also said Qualcomm sought to punish it for cooperating in a South Korean investigation into Qualcomm's licensing practices by withholding a $1 billion rebate.", "Apple wants a court to lower the amount it pays Qualcomm in licensing fees, as well as order the return of the $1 billion.", "Qualcomm maintains that no modern handset -- including the iPhone -- would have been possible \"without relying upon Qualcomm's fundamental cellular technologies.\"", "In its response to Apple's filing, the company made its own counterclaims, including breach of contract and unfair competition.", "It also asked for an unspecified amount in damages and said Apple had interfered with its relationship with contract manufacturers.", "In May 2017, Qualcomm filed a lawsuit against Apple's iPhone manufacturers that alleged breach of contract.", "The suit came less than a month after Apple stopped paying patent royalties for Qualcomm technology that's essential for connecting phones to a wireless network.", "In July 2017, those four iPhone makers joined Apple by filing a suit against Qualcomm, alleging it used its market position to charge excessive royalties.", "The four companies are Foxconn parent Hon Hai Precision Industry, Wistron, Compal Electronics and Pegatron.", "They're seeking at least $9 billion in damages, which could be tripled to $27 billion under antitrust law.", "Some companies license patents on an individual basis; Qualcomm licenses all its patents as a group. For a set fee -- based on the selling price of the end device, typically a phone -- the device maker gets to use all of Qualcomm's technology.", "It's been the norm in the mobile industry for patent holders to base their licensing fees on the total value of a handset, so Qualcomm isn't alone there.", "Ericsson, Huawei , Nokia , Samsung and ZTE also charge licensing fees based on the total device.

It doesn't license its patents to chipmakers, though, which is something governments and Apple have taken issue with.", "Qualcomm argues that chipmakers don't need licenses because the handset makers already cover the cost of using its technology.", "Apple licenses Qualcomm's technology through its manufacturers, like Foxconn, instead of having a license of its own.", "Apple said during the January trial that it's been trying for five years to negotiate a direct license with Qualcomm but that the terms offered -- like cross-licensing Apple's technology -- weren't fair.", "Apple's manufacturing partners are also involved in the legal disputes.", "In April 2017, Apple said it stopped paying Qualcomm royalties for devices sold during the March quarter.", "Qualcomm accused the manufacturers of breach of contract. Qualcomm in October said that Apple owes it $7 billion in patent licensing fees.", "Qualcomm's licensing fees are based on the total value of a device ($999 in the case of the iPhone XS) versus the value of a chip (closer to $20), but they're also capped at a certain level.", "The FTC-Qualcomm battle revealed specific details about Qualcomm's licensing fees, including the rate Apple paid.", "Apple partners paid Qualcomm a licensing fee five times higher than it thought was fair, Apple COO Jeff Williams testified during the FTC trial.", "Apple wanted to pay $1.50 per device in royalties to Qualcomm, based on a 5 percent fee for the cost of each $30 modem connecting iPhones to mobile networks.", "Instead, it ended up paying $7.50 per phone, he said.", "\"The whole idea of a percentage of the cost of the phone didn't make sense to us,\" Williams said. \"It struck at our very core of fairness.", "At the time we were making something really, really different.\"", "Still, Apple agreed to the rate since it was lower than what Qualcomm wanted to charge the contract manufacturers -- a 5 percent fee for every iPhone sold, which would equate to about $12 to $20 per device, Williams said.", "A rebate agreement dropped that to $7.50 per iPhone, and the level stayed steady over the years.", "In November 2017, Chinese handset makers started paying Qualcomm royalties for its 3G and 4G patents at 3.25 percent of the selling price of every phone sold in that country.", "Qualcomm later rolled that rate out across its licensing base. It also capped the value of handsets, which its royalty is based on, at $400, even if a device sold for triple that.", "And Qualcomm's cap for a full portfolio license is $20 per device and $13 for only Qualcomm's essential patents.", "By comparison, in one of its patent battles with Samsung, Apple argued it deserved $40 per device for Samsung's infringement of five patents, as well as lost profits, for a total of $2.19 billion.", "A jury ultimately ordered Samsung to pay $119.6 million for infringing three of Apple's five patents that related to software features like \"quick links\" and \"slide to unlock.\"", "And in the March patent trial between Apple and Qualcomm, a jury decided that three non-essential patents from Qualcomm were worth $1.41 per iPhone.", "When Apple first launched the iPhone a decade ago, it used modems from Germany's Infineon.

Defendant Qualcomm Incorporated (\"Qualcomm\") is a Delaware corporation with its principal place of business in San Diego, CA.", "Id., ¶ 11. Qualcomm \"is the second-biggest maker of mobile-phone chips and holds more than 1,400 patents which it licenses to more than 130 companies, including chip makers and cell phone manufacturers.\"", "Cell phones today \"principally use one of two leading wireless technologies: either the Global System for Mobility ('GSM') or the Code Division Multiple Access ('CDMA').\"", "Id., ¶ 12. These GSM and CDMA systems \"have unique features and technology, thus neither the systems, nor the phones used for each system are interchangeable or substitutes — a GSM phone will not work on a CDMA network and vice versa.\"", "Id. The \"chipsets that operate cell phones must conform to the technology for the system for which the phone is being manufactured.\"", "Id., ¶ 13. As the technologies evolve, they are referred to by \"generations.\" Id. The GSM and CDMA pathways evolve independently.", "\"Qualcomm holds certain patents that it asserts are 'essential' to the CDMA technology and standard and, according to Qualcomm, the CDMA standard cannot be practiced without using Qualcomm technology based on its patents.\"", "Id., ¶ 15. Standard setting organizations (\"SDO's\") adopted CDMA as a standard technology for a new generation of phones such that \"any company that wanted to produce a CDMA compliant product had to pay licensing fees to Qualcomm for use of its CDMA intellectual property rights.\"", "By virtue of its patents of certain CDMA intellectual property rights and incorporation and adoption by CDMA standards rendering such patents 'essential' to the manufacture of CDMA-complaint devices, Qualcomm had and continues to exercise market and monopoly power in the relevant CDMA patent technology market — a market separate and distinct from the CDMA-chipset market. . . .", "Qualcomm has used that power over CDMA technology to obtain and protect monopoly power in the CDMA chipset market.", "\"In at least some manufacturer licenses, Qualcomm substantially reduces royalty rates when a licensee agrees to purchase Qualcomm chipsets exclusively.\"", "Id., ¶ 31. For example, Qualcomm's \"patent licensing agreements with Chinese cell phone manufacturers are expressly discriminatory and explicitly linked to those manufacturers' use of Qualcomm chipsets.\"", "Id. Qualcomm has \"publicly summarized\" that the royalty rates provided to certain Chinese manufacturers \"are more favorable than our standard rates,\" partly because these manufacturers agree to use Qualcomm's chipsets.", "Id., ¶ 32. Qualcomm's \"royalty rate discrimination furthers no legitimate competitive interest or business need,\" but rather \"is intended to harm, and has the effect of harming, competition in the CDMA chipset market and the CDMA device market.\"", "Id., ¶ 33. Qualcomm's royalty rate discrimination also violates Qualcomm's commitments to the SDOs to license its CDMA intellectual property rights on fair, reasonable, and non-discriminatory (\"FRAND\") terms.", "Qualcomm collects double royalties through insisting \"on licenses at both the component and the cell phone level.\"", "CDMA cell phone manufacturers pay a royalty to Qualcomm for rights including the right to make (or to have made) and use CDMA chipset[s] in CDMA-complaint cell phones to be sold by the licensee.", "Cell phone manufacturer licensees pay the same royalty rate per handset regardless of whether they make (or have made) their own customized CDMA chipsets or buy from a CDMA chipset manufacturer that is licensed by Qualcomm.", "Thus, when a CDMA chipset cell phone manufacturer buys a CDMA chipset from a Qualcomm licensee, both the handset manufacturer and the chipset manufacturer are paying a royalty to Qualcomm for the right to make the chipset.", "Id., ¶ 41. This \"royalty rate scheme enables [Qualcomm] inappropriately to charge twice for the same intellectual property right.\"", "Id., ¶ 40. Qualcomm's efforts to collect double royalties compels \"each customer to negotiate with Qualcomm for a separate license, even if that customer wants to purchase chipsets from a source other than Qualcomm;\" violates Qualcomm's commitments to license its CDMA intellectual property rights on FRAND terms; and violates the \"patent exhaustion doctrine by collecting and requiring CDMA component and handset manufacturers to pay twice for the same license.\"", "\"Qualcomm has protected its interests through non-disclosure agreements that prohibit parties to its CDMA licensing agreements from disclosing confidential information, including its discriminatory royalty rate pricing structure.\"", "Id., ¶ 45.

Qualcomm's \"CDMA licensing practices constitute a trust in violation of the Cartwright Act, even if Qualcomm's commitment to FRAND licensing was not intentionally false at the time it was made and Qualcomm created a trust by simply reneging on its commitment to FRAND licensing for the CDMA patents and engaging in the discriminatory and exclusive licensing practices alleged herein.\"", "Id., ¶ 68.

Qualcomm's licensing practices \"are unfair or deceptive business acts or practices because even if Qualcomm's commitment to FRAND licensing was not intentionally false at the time it was made, Qualcomm committed an unfair or deceptive business act or practice by simply reneging on its commitment to FRAND licensing and offering on a discriminatory basis its licenses for the CDMA patents.\"", "Id., ¶ 88. Qualcomm's conduct constitutes an unlawful business practice because it \"violates federal, state, statutory, regulatory, or common law,\" and is \"unethical, unscrupulous, and substantially injurious to consumers.\"", "Id., ¶¶ 89-90. Qualcomm's conduct constitutes a fraudulent business practice because Qualcomm's \"conduct was likely to mislead Plaintiff and all others similarly situated by deceiving and leading customers to believe, among other things, that the additional amounts paid by consumer for CDMA-compliant cellular devices and/or cellular services were warranted and appropriate.\"", "Claim IV: Equitable and Injunctive Relief pursuant to Section 16 of the Clayton Act", "Qualcomm's anticompetitive conduct has \"caused artificially high prices for CDMA-compliant devices\" and for \"cellular services purchased by consumers who buy from carriers which bundle their cellular service with subsidized CDMA-capable devices.\"", "Qualcomm \"willfully engaged in predatory and anticompetitive conduct intentionally to obtain monopoly power in the relevant market in violation of common law.\"", "Id., ¶ 98. Qualcomm has acted \"with a specific intent to monopolize the CDMA-chipset market\" and has illegally attempted \"to monopolize in violation of California common law\" through requiring \"discriminatory and exclusive licensing agreements.\"", "Id., ¶¶ 102-103. Plaintiff and the putative class have suffered injury as a result of Qualcomm's monopoly power and anticompetitive conduct \"because they have been, and continue to be, forced to purchase CDMA-complaint devices at a price that is higher because of Qualcomm's royalty, because of the lack of competition in the CDMA-chipset market as a result of Qualcomm's licensing practices, or because the CDMA-chipset market has in otehr ways been harmed by Qualcomm's conduct.\"", "Qualcomm \"intentionally offered its CDMA intellectual property rights on a discriminatory and exclusionary basis in order to obtain and maintain an unjust, anticompetitive advantage.\"", "Id., ¶ 108.

The majority of Web traffic is now encrypted, which wasn’t true only a couple of years ago,” Terrasi noted.", "The problem is that “it isn’t kept safe when it has reached whoever collects it. Most of the time, data is encrypted when it moves over the wire, but architecturally data has to be decrypted to be used, and it is used all the time,” he said.", "“The privacy of most people living today is irrevocably lost, but that doesn’t mean we shouldn’t try to build new architectures and protocols to protect the privacy of those who come after us — or of our future selves, as we change over time and old data about us becomes stale,” Terrasi argued.", "“If we impose requirements that force companies to be transparent with users about what data they collect, and build new Internet software infrastructure — think protocols — that build in more privacy by default,” he suggested, “we can set ourselves on a better footing going forward.”"]}

Derivative Litigation, which first established the test—discussed below—for board liability in an oversight context).", "Qualcomm subsequently moved to dismiss the Complaint under Delaware Court of Chancery Rule 23.1 for, among other things, failure to adequately allege demand futility, which the court granted as to all three counts after first reviewing the standards that must be met to prove demand futility under Delaware law (“to excuse demand, the alleged derivative claims against the board must be sufficiently strong such that a majority of the members of the board face a ‘substantial likelihood’ of personal liability”).", "The court began its analysis of the Caremark count by reiterating the two bases on which directors may be held liable for a Caremark claim under Delaware law: “(a) the directors utterly failed to implement any reporting or information system or controls; or (b) having implemented such a system or controls, consciously failed to monitor or oversee its operations thus disabling themselves from being informed of risks or problems requiring their attention.”", "The court noted that the plaintiffs in this case were relying on the second prong of the Caremark test, and thus their Complaint “must allege ‘(1) that the directors knew or should have known that the corporation was violating the law, (2) that the directors acted in bad faith by failing to prevent or remedy those violations, and (3) that such failure resulted in damage to the corporation.’”", "Further, because the plaintiffs were not alleging that the Qualcomm board intentionally caused Qualcomm to violate the law, the court said that in order to adequately plead bad faith the plaintiffs “must plead particularized facts from which it is reasonably inferable that the [b]oard consciously disregarded its duties by ‘intentionally fail[ing] to act in the face of a known duty to act.’”", "In this regard, the court said, “[s]imply alleging that a board incorrectly exercised its business judgment and made a ‘wrong’ decision in response to red flags . . .", "Applying these principles to the case before it, the court found that the Complaint “fails to allege particularized facts giving rise to an inference that a majority of the board faces a substantial likelihood of liability on the Caremark claim alleged” and thus failed to adequately plead demand futility.", "The court said that, at the outset, it “need not address whether the alleged red flags actually constitute red flags or whether the board’s response to the alleged red flags caused damage to Qualcomm because the Complaint fails to plead facts giving rise to an inference that the board acted in bad faith.”", "For example, the court said that even “[a]ssuming for purposes of this analysis that the various reports to the Audit Committee and the board [cited by the plaintiffs] constituted red flags, the Complaint does not allege that the board consciously disregarded the red flags.”", "In fact, the court noted that “[m]any of the documents the Complaint cites as red flags also include planned remedial actions.”", "The court then went through some of the Qualcomm board’s responses to the alleged “red flags” cited by the shareholders as proof of bad faith or conscious disregard on the part of the board, and concluded as follows:", "“These responses to the red flags show that the board did not act in bad faith. There is no indication that the board believed Qualcomm could continue to violate the FCPA without consequences.", "And no allegations suggest that the Qualcomm board consciously disregarded the red flags. The allegations in the Complaint do not adequately plead ‘an intentional dereliction of duty’ after the board was aware of the risk of future FCPA violations through the red flags.", "In fact, Plaintiffs point to only two factual allegations as evidence of a failure to respond to the red flags: a December 31, 2013 target date for the translation of its FCPA compliance materials into Chinese (which Plaintiffs allege was too late) and the company’s plan to formulate a long-range FCPA plan (which Plaintiffs again contend was too late because it remained outstanding as of January 27, 2014).", "These board decisions do not rise to the level of bad faith. Instead, Plaintiffs here simply seek to second-guess the timing and manner of the board’s response to the red flags, which fails to state a Caremark claim.”", "Finally, the court also rejected the plaintiffs’ argument that the SEC’s findings in the 2016 cease-and-desist order regarding Qualcomm’s violation of the FCPA were proof positive of dereliction of duty in bad faith by the Qualcomm board, stating:", "“A corporation’s violation of the FCPA alone is not enough for director liability under Caremark.

Julian, Partner, Litigation", "Why it matters: A recently circulated and sure to be controversial decision by a French court of appeals raises interesting issues in connection with cross-border prosecutions.", "In the decision, the French appellate court ruled that an individual who had pleaded guilty to Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) violations and entered into a plea agreement in the United States could not be prosecuted for the same offense in France.", "The court’s novel reasoning: Because the individual had had “no choice” but to enter into the plea agreement with U.S. authorities (under which he was obligated to plead guilty and prohibited from later denying any admissions made in the agreement), he had been deprived of his right to self-defense protected by the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR).", "Detailed discussion: On June 28, 2017, online blog FCPA Professor posted a missive from Paris-based attorney Frederick Davis reporting on a decision by a French court of appeals (from September 2016 but only recently circulated) that adds another wrinkle to the ongoing issues surrounding cross-border prosecutions, at least between the United States and France.", "The French appellate court ruled that an individual who had pleaded guilty to FCPA violations and entered into a plea agreement in the United States could not be prosecuted for the same offense in France.", "The court’s reasoning: Because the individual had had “no choice” but to enter into the plea agreement with U.S. authorities (under which he was obligated to plead guilty and prohibited from later denying any admissions made in the agreement), he had been deprived of his right to self-defense protected by the ECHR.", "The case involved former U.K. solicitor Jeffrey Tesler, who in March 2011 had entered into a written plea agreement with the U.S. Department of Justice in which he agreed to plead guilty to FCPA violations.", "A Southern District of Texas court formally accepted the plea agreement in February 2012, at which point a judgment of conviction was entered against Tesler.", "At roughly the same time overseas, following a lengthy investigation in France by an investigating magistrate, Tesler was ordered to stand trial in November 2010 for alleged criminal violations of the French anti-bribery statute based largely on the same facts underlying the U.S. investigation.", "In a decision handed down in September 2016 but circulated only recently, the French appellate court ruled that Tesler could not be prosecuted in France because (as translated from French)", "“[Tesler’s guilty plea] prohibited him from contradicting his acknowledgment of guilt for fear that the U.S. authorities would walk away from their agreement and reopen the prosecution against him, thus depriving him of his ability to insist on his innocence without abandoning his right against self-incrimination or his right of self-defense.”", "As Davis put it, the court’s “key reasoning was that by pleading guilty in the U.S., Tesler put himself under an obligation not to contradict any of the factual or legal representations he had made there, and therefore was powerless to defend himself in French court without fear of violating his plea agreement and incurring the wrath of U.S. prosecutors.”", "To underscore this point, the court continued (again, translated from French), “It is difficult to conclude that this situation resulted from a considered and personal decision by the accused (even if surrounded by lawyers) when faced with American judicial authorities armed with such powers and capable of proceeding against him to obtain particularly lengthy sentences (several decades) if he refused to plead guilty.”", "According to Davis, the court’s decision in the Tesler case was based on a “clearly animated” belief that U.S. criminal procedures “lack fairness” in contravention of the ECHR.", "Davis also noted that in 2015 another French court came to the same conclusion (i.e., no French prosecution after U.S. guilty plea) on different grounds based on the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, which decision is still being appealed to “uncertain outcome.”", "In addition to creating uncertainty in cross-border investigations, at least between the United States and France, Davis said that the “perverse effect” of these French cases “may be to encourage recourse to U.S. negotiated outcomes for the simple reason that its ruling means that a U.S. plea precludes prosecution in France, while the same would clearly not be the case were the situation reversed.”", "Davis continued, “The notion that a carefully negotiated guilty plea by a wealthy defendant advised by experienced counsel, and apparently in strict compliance with U.S. procedures, is nonetheless ‘involuntary’ will appear preposterous to U.S. lawyers and prosecutors; on its face, the court’s ruling would undermine the validity of virtually any U.S. guilty plea. …", "It is the opinion of the author, however, that the perception is already widespread in Europe that U.S. prosecutors exercise far too much power with far too little judicial supervision, a point of view that this decision will encourage.”", "Davis concluded with a discussion of the “right of self-defense” that French courts appear to believe is undercut by a U.S. guilty plea:", "“[I]n France (and elsewhere in continental Europe) the right of self defense implies a right to some testimonial flexibility.", "Generally speaking, criminal defendants are encouraged to speak on their own behalf (among other reasons, because a strong inference of guilt may often be drawn from their failure to do so), but they are not put under oath.", "The reason for this is a widespread belief that it is unfair to force on a defendant the stark choice between insisting on silence (and leaving the prosecutor’s case unrebutted) and risking a perjury prosecution at the hands of the same prosecutor.", "This has led to the concept—which does not appear in any text, but is openly discussed in France—of a so-called ‘right to lie.’", "Even before this decision, there has been frequent anecdotal comment, and one published article, criticizing provisions in many U.S. Deferred Prosecution and Non-Prosecution Agreements where a defendant formally agrees not to contradict elsewhere anything said in the agreement.", "This provision is clearly intended by U.S. prosecutors to avoid the public relations fiasco of a defendant insisting on innocence even after expressing contrition in a formal agreement, but in France is disparagingly called a “muzzle clause,” and is widely viewed as a pernicious example of the extraterritorial reach of U.S. criminal procedures.”", "By John F. Libby, Partner, Corporate Investigations and White Collar Defense | Jacqueline C. Wolff, Partner, Corporate Investigations and White Collar Defense | Kenneth B. Julian, Partner, Litigation", "Why it matters: In a speech on July 25, 2017, Sandra Moser, acting chief of the Fraud Section of the Department of Justice (DOJ), announced that prosecutors from the agency’s Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) Unit would henceforth be “working hand in hand” with the Corporate Strike Force of the agency’s Healthcare Fraud Unit to “investigate and prosecute matters relating to healthcare bribery schemes, both domestic and abroad.”", "Detailed discussion: On July 25, 2017, Sandra Moser, the acting chief of the DOJ’s Fraud Section, delivered a speech at the American Conference Institute’s 8th Global Forum on Anti-Corruption in High Risk Markets in Washington, D.C., where, among other things, she announced that prosecutors from the Fraud Section’s FCPA Unit would henceforth be “working hand in hand” with the Corporate Strike Force of the Fraud Section’s Healthcare Fraud Unit to “investigate and prosecute matters relating to health care bribery schemes, both domestic and abroad.”", "Moser’s remarks were made in the context of a larger “state of the FCPA” speech. She began by stating that at this point in time, the United States and other countries “stand at a critical juncture in the fight against transnational corruption” and its devastating effects, giving as examples the “undermin[ing] of the rule of law and destabiliz[ation of] economies; the link between corruption and terrorism and the attendant threat to global security;", "[and] the erosion of the free and fair market and, with it, the public’s confidence.” Moser said that, from an FCPA enforcement perspective, the DOJ is “well-positioned to remain at the forefront of the fight against corruption” especially with full and increasingly strong coordination with the global enforcement community.", "To combat such “deep rooted and pervasive corruption,” Moser said that corporations needed to “[b]e better, do better” and provided a helpful list to accomplish this, including investing in a robust compliance program sooner rather than later and empowering compliance officers.", "Moser stated that the Fraud Section—through its FCPA Unit—is doing its part to “be better, do better” by, among other things, “taking additional steps to enhance our enforcement of the FCPA against both corporate and individual actors, and to promote transparency in doing so.”", "Moser pointed to the FCPA pilot program announced in April 2016 as just one example of the DOJ’s focus on transparency by offering “clearer guidelines not only internally to our own prosecutors, but to companies and their employees, regarding what is required to receive full credit under its auspices.”", "See our April 2016 newsletter article titled “Alert: DOJ Launches New FCPA Voluntary Disclosure Pilot Program” for a discussion of the FCPA pilot program’s provisions.", "After providing an overview of the FCPA Unit’s notable global resolutions and enforcement actions against both corporations and individuals in 2016 and the first six months of 2017 across all markets, industries and business sectors, Moser turned her focus to the healthcare industry: “This conference is all about high-risk regions and high-risk industries.", "As you know, health care cuts across both.” Moser pointed out that in recent years healthcare companies have increasingly come before the Fraud Section in connection with FCPA violations: “Investigations have revealed that healthcare companies operating overseas frequently interact with state-employed doctors and foreign public officials who work for government-owned hospitals and medical institutions.", "In addition, publicly funded and administered foreign health care programs are invariably run by government officials, which means that, to do business in these countries, a company must deal with government officials.", "As a result, we have seen a number of significant FCPA cases involving the payment of bribes and kickbacks by healthcare companies to foreign officials to obtain a wide variety of improper business advantages.”", "Moser noted that, in all of these instances, the FCPA violations arose from failures in the healthcare companies’ compliance programs, or the absence of those programs altogether.", "Among the “basics” for large international corporations that were lacking or missing altogether were “things like maintaining a confidential employee hotline, enhancing training, having those at the top of the food chain certify to the effectiveness of the compliance program, and adopting guidelines to claw back bonuses and the like from those executives that engage in misconduct or who simply fail to promote compliance within their organization.”", "Thus, Moser concluded, “to become better and more efficient” at investigating and prosecuting foreign bribery and kickbacks involving healthcare companies and their executives, she was announcing a new partnership between the Corporate Strike Force of the Healthcare Fraud Unit and the FCPA Unit: “Together they will investigate and prosecute matters relating to health care bribery schemes, both domestic and abroad.", "This increased coordination will ensure that companies, their executives, employees, and agents are held to account for the payment of bribes and kickbacks to foreign and domestic officials and actors regardless of the market.”", "Criminal Charges, Civil Fines for Bitcoin Exchange and Operator", "By John F.

Gox—an earlier digital currency exchange that eventually failed, in part due to losses attributable to hacking.”", "The indictment alleged that BTC-e “allowed its users to trade in the digital currency ‘Bitcoin’ with high levels of anonymity” and that since BTC-e’s inception, (1) “Vinnik and others developed a customer base for BTC-e that was heavily reliant on criminals, including by not requiring users to validate their identity, obscuring and anonymizing transactions and source of funds, and by lacking any anti-money laundering processes”; (2) “BTC-e was operated to facilitate transactions for cybercriminals worldwide and received the criminal proceeds of numerous computer intrusions and hacking incidents, ransomware scams, identity theft schemes, corrupt public officials, and narcotics distribution rings”; and (3) “BTC-e was used to facilitate crimes ranging from computer hacking, to fraud, identity theft, tax refund fraud schemes, public corruption, and drug trafficking.”", "Although BTC-e conducted “substantial” business in the United States, the indictment further alleged that the currency exchange was “not registered as a money services business with the U.S. Department of the Treasury, had no anti-money laundering process, no system for appropriate ‘know your customer’ or ‘KYC’ verification, and no anti-money laundering program as required by federal law.”", "Under the indictment, BTC-e and Vinnik were charged with one count of operation of an unlicensed money service business (in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1960) and one count of conspiracy to commit money laundering (in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1956(h)).", "In addition, Vinnik was charged with 17 counts of money laundering (in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1956(a)(1)) and two counts of engaging in unlawful monetary transactions (in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1957).", "Said Brian J. Stretch, U.S. attorney for the Northern District of California, “Cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin provide people around the world new and innovative ways of engaging in legitimate commerce.", "As this case demonstrates, however, just as new computer technologies continue to change the way we engage each other and experience the world, so too will criminals subvert these new technologies to serve their own nefarious purposes.”", "Added Acting Assistant Attorney General Kenneth A. Blanco, “The Criminal Division will work tirelessly to identify those who use technology to conduct and obscure their criminal activity, as we ensure there are no safe havens from U.S. justice for those who seek to victimize Americans.”", "FinCEN fines: In its press release, FinCEN said that the supervisory enforcement action against BTC-e and Vinnik (against which and whom it assessed $110 million and $12 million in civil fines, respectively) was “the first it has taken against a foreign-located MSB [money services business] doing business in the United States.”", "FinCEN described BTC-e as “an internet-based, foreign-located money transmitter that exchanges fiat currency as well as the convertible virtual currencies Bitcoin, Litecoin, Namecoin, Novacoin, Peercoin, Ethereum, and Dash.", "It is one of the largest virtual currency exchanges by volume in the world.” FinCEN said that to date BTC-e had conducted “over $296 million in transactions of bitcoin alone and tens of thousands of transactions in other convertible virtual currencies.”", "FinCEN noted that while BTC-e had taken great pains to conceal its geographic location and ownership, it had conducted transactions within the United States and thus “was required to comply with U.S. AML laws and regulations as a foreign-located MSB including AML program, MSB registration, suspicious activity reporting, and recordkeeping requirements.”", "Overall, FinCEN said that BTC-e “facilitated transactions involving ransomware, computer hacking, identity theft, tax refund fraud schemes, public corruption, and drug trafficking” and “embraced the pervasive criminal activity conducted at the exchange.”", "Among BTC-e’s specific AML violations cited by FinCEN were the following: (1) “BTC-e failed to obtain required information from customers beyond a username, a password, and an e-mail address”; (2) “Users openly and explicitly discussed criminal activity on BTC-e’s user chat", "[and] BTC-e’s customer service representatives offered advice on how to process and access money obtained from illegal drug sales on dark net markets like Silk Road, Hansa Market, and AlphaBay”; (3) BTC-e “processed [over 300,000 bitcoin] transactions involving funds stolen between 2011 and 2014 from one of the world’s largest bitcoin exchanges, Mt. Gox”; and (4) BTC-e facilitated “at least $3 million of … transactions tied to ransomware attacks such as ‘Cryptolocker’ and ‘Locky’ [and] shared customers and conducted transactions with the now-defunct money laundering website Liberty Reserve.”", "Said Jamal El-Hindi, acting director of FinCEN, “We will hold accountable foreign-located money transmitters, including virtual currency exchangers, that do business in the United States when they willfully violate U.S. anti-money laundering laws ...", "This action should be a strong deterrent to anyone who thinks that they can facilitate ransomware, dark net drug sales, or conduct other illicit activity using encrypted virtual currency.”"]}

My mom and dad are in Brazil, and a lot of relatives in Brazil as well.", "That’s great. You went on to attend the State University of Campinas in Brazil, that’s where you studied electrical engineering.", "I think I told you this recently, I always think of engineers as people who like to fix things, which is very appropriate when I think of all the things you’re doing in Qualcomm.", "What was it like initially? What sparked your interest in being an engineer?", "Well, it’s two things. One, my dad was an electrical engineer as well, so I think that probably had a big influence.", "I always liked math and science. And I remember my dad said to me, I could go to any college I want, as long as it was a medical school, engineering school, or law school.", "So between those three options, I think engineering looked like a more natural choice for me.", "You didn’t have many options, but you picked the right one for you. It sounds it’s a little bit of a family legacy as well.", "Yeah. But I always like to say, I’ve always been curious about things. I’ve always been intrigued by radio communications, that’s where I ended up building my career.", "I think having my dad as an engineer in the family was definitely an inspiration for me.", "You went to Qualcomm not too long after you graduated, but what did you do in between?", "So I graduated in 1992. The early ’90s really were when you have the boom of the cellular industry. Still analog cellular — 1G at the time — but it was an industry that was really growing.", "I started working, and fortunately or unfortunately, I have been working in wireless and cellular my whole career.", "I started my career working for a Japanese company called NEC. At the time, NEC was pretty big in cellular.", "It had some presence in the United States, but was also very big in Latin America and Japan. So I started working at NEC and a little bit over a year into the company, they transferred me to the headquarters.", "So the first time I left Brazil, I actually moved to Tokyo and I was working as a system engineer for NEC in Japan.", "Part of the evolution at NEC at the time was looking into digital cellular, and we looked at a technology called CDMA that was created by Qualcomm.", "So as an employee of NEC, I came to San Diego. That was back in 1994. We were looking into discussions with Qualcomm into getting a CDMA license.", "Then soon thereafter, Qualcomm made me an offer, and I joined Qualcomm in 1995.", "Was that with a Latin American focus at that point, or did that come later?", "During the time I was working at NEC, I think I started in Latin America. There was a lot of activity with the deployment of cellular to a number of countries.", "Then I joined Qualcomm in 1995. That was just before the very first CDMA launch that was in Hong Kong with Hutchison.", "At a time at Qualcomm, I’d done a lot of different things. It was early days of CDMA in cellular, so I spent a lot of time getting frequency allocated.", "Given my knowledge of Latin America, I traveled to virtually every country in South America trying to get CDMA adopted.", "At that time, we were working in Qualcomm in infrastructure. In those kind of the early days of CDMA, Qualcomm needed to prove it worked.", "So we had both infrastructure and the phone business.", "So it was fun time. I spent a lot of time in Latin America early in my career, which was great.", "It was based out of San Diego. I was in the Brazil office for about a year and a half, and then Qualcomm transferred me to San Diego in late ’96, beginning of ’97.", "That’s an interesting story, that’s a very good one.", "So like I said, I started my career at in NEC, then Qualcomm. I left Qualcomm in about 1999. I spent about a year at Ericsson in infrastructure, but then, I wanted to do something different.", "I wanted to get different kinds of experience. In hindsight, I think it was the right choice. It really helped me become a more rounded business person.", "So I left Ericsson and I joined a VC out of Denver. It was company called VeloCom. Really, it was the TCI Cable management team.", "When they sold TCI Cable to AT&T, they put together a fund. They were going to invest in telecom and they would have a focus in Latin America.", "My boss at that time — who is still a dear friend and has been a great mentor in my career — was Nick Kauser.", "He was the CTO of McCaw Cellular, which was the very first cellular operator in the world. Then later, when McCaw was sold to AT&T, he became the CTO of AT&T.", "The reason I tell the story is because, during the battle at the time of Qualcomm’s CDMA versus TDMA, You had our founder, Dr. Irwin Jacobs, spearheading CDMA, and you had Nick spearheading TDMA.", "Then I left Qualcomm to go work for Nick, which was a great experience. So Nick was a great mentor.", "At the time, we started investing in a lot of different companies in Latin America, Brazil, Argentina.", "Then the dotcom bubble burst in 2000, and we started divesting some of the investments. That’s where the Vesper thing came to bear.", "As part of dealing with the dotcom bubble burst, plus the divestment story, one of the investments that we had — together with an operator, Bell Canada — was going to go through a process similar to Chapter 11.", "They needed to put together a team to go do the restructuring of the company. So I raised my hand, and I was CTO of the company, later becoming COO.", "It was an interesting journey. I moved back to Brazil — that was some point in 2000 or 2001. It was a three-year journey to get a company that was basically bankrupt to positive EBITDA.", "Then we sold it to what is today América Móvil and I rejoined Qualcomm.", "I don’t want to give you too many details, but that’s the context of Vesper. It was great experience for me, because working in a restructure environment, you learn a lot.", "So I think I gained about 10 years of experience in three.", "That’s amazing. The experience you had at Vesper must include things that you draw from even today, in your leadership position now.", "Absolutely. It gave me a whole different perspective about how to deal with adversity and crisis.", "I remember somebody that I worked with in the Vesper restructure team, he always said, “Only in a crisis do you see the true quality of the management team you have.”", "I do think that, once you’re worried about making payroll, making taxes, and staying alive, and you have to re-invent the company, that gives you an incredible perspective on how to deal with adversity.", "Hopefully that has been helpful for me throughout my career at Qualcomm.", "When you came back to Qualcomm, coming from being an investor, was the transition difficult in the new role?", "Because you’d been a leader at Vesper. So you had been doing that, and then you came over. I’m curious what skills you brought over, but also, was that transition hard?", "No, it wasn’t hard. I think it was very interesting timing. Let me tell you a little bit about that history and what was behind the timing of that transition.", "One thing that I ended up building a reputation within Qualcomm for was to kind of go and solve problems.", "The Vesper experience was a tough experience, dealing with a restructuring. Then once that was over and we sold the company, I didn’t want to continue on an operator, I wanted to go back to the technology sector.", "Qualcomm approached me and said, “Look, we’d like you to come back to San Diego. We have a problem for you: CDMA.”", "This was a 2G and 3G time. CDMA in many different locations was being replaced by GSM as a technology, it was having a footprint reduction.", "Irwin was CEO of Qualcomm at that time and said, “Look, why don’t you come back? We want you to go back to run our CDMA business, on the chip side.”", "That’s where I joined a Qualcomm chip division for the first time — back in the beginning of 2004 or 2005, if my memory serves me.", "It was kind of good timing. And it wasn’t that hard of a transition, because I was kind of back to my roots.", "That’s how I started my career. And it was a very interesting journey. Since then, we have done well with CDMA, the transition of that to 4G LTE, and then most recently, the transition to 5G.", "You became president of Qualcomm in what, 2018? Then last year, obviously, you took over as CEO. What were your immediate goals upon taking over those two positions?", "Excellent question. I have a very clear answer to give to you.", "When I became president in 2018, my number one goal here was to accelerate the global transition to 5G.", "In fact, you may have seen or not have seen, but a key milestone in that process was when we launched 5G one year ahead of schedule.", "We had an event at Mobile World Congress that pretty much every executive of every company that we partner with — from operators to infrastructure vendors, to test equipment, to manufacturers — was there at the Qualcomm booth, toasting that we’d done it.", "I didn’t like the set of cards that we had with 4G. I think 5G was an acceleration — it was instrumental to resolve a lot of the disputes we had with some of our customers and change the position of Qualcomm.", "So that was my clear goal in 2018: how do we commercialize 5G one year ahead of schedule to drive that global transition from 4G to 5G?", "The second thing, which I started as president and has been my key goal as CEO, is to diversify the company.", "We put in a lot of effort. It’s not easy, by the way, to build new core competences in companies and to be able to pivot.", "I’m not saying this to give myself any credit. I think this is a general statement that every CEO would agree with.", "If you’ve known your entire career how to do one thing very well, learning new things is a difficult thing to do.", "But you know, I was and I am in a hurry to diversify the company. We needed to build expertise in a different areas.", "Our front end was one, automotive was another one. And then, the broader transformation of the edge, which we call our Internet of Things business.", "So my goal as CEO, going back to your question, is: how do I change Qualcomm from a company that has always been very focused in communications in cellular into the company that provides all the processing, the cloud connectivity, and the artificial intelligence for everything that happens outside the data center?", "We call that the edge. I think that’s the mission I set for myself to build at Qualcomm and that’s the journey we are on right now.", "We’ve talked about this, but from the pandemic and supply chain shortages to inflation and fears of recession, I’ve been very struck by your optimism.", "You’re a CEO who, as I describe to others and I described here, believes in fixing things and knows that, among the vast empire of Qualcomm and the chipmaking industry in general, you’ve faced several challenges in the past.", "You know the demand, you know the need, you see the future. I’m just curious, how do you navigate this?", "In your question, you probably gave part of the answer. In one way, we can’t be tone deaf to what the current environment is.", "But in another way, we have a lot of reasons to be optimistic about the future.", "I’ll break that down into two buckets. One bucket is the technology trends that are driving the transformation of the company.", "They are clearly in front of us and they are not going to change, whether we have inflation, or recession, or not.", "Those trends are very clear. Everything is becoming cloud connected. You have the merging of physical and digital spaces.", "You have the new work environment that is changing PCs into next-generation PCs. The car is becoming a connected computer on wheels, the automotive industry is changing.", "The list goes on and on. So my first reason to be optimistic is those technology trends are real, and we can actually cause transformation and be disruptive with our technologies.", "This second bucket… It’s not that technical, but we dealt with the pandemic. We dealt with the massive supply chain disruption.", "So bring it on. We can deal with it. I think that’s what companies need to do.", "What also strikes me so much is, when I talk to you and hear you speak about the global team, how much culture matters to you.", "This team of extraordinary engineers and folks on the front lines having that culture is, I think, something that you’re very proud of.", "Qualcomm kind of preserved and conserved during this period, but also advanced, which is important to you.", "It is the most important asset of the company. Not to start a whole new conversation, but that’s why, when I think about this new hybrid work environment that we’re all in, I spend a lot of time thinking, how do I preserve that culture?", "Culture is one of the most important things we have. Because all we have is people. We’re the largest fabless semiconductor company, we don’t have any factories.", "All we have is people. I think a culture that is very grounded on deep engineering expertise, innovation, and solving some of the world’s biggest technology problems.", "And then, be motivated that the technology that every engineer works on will change the society. I think that’s one of the best assets of the company.", "I spend a lot of time making sure that we continue to reinforce, evolve, and preserve this culture that we have, which started in the very beginning when the company was a startup.", "One of the things I have done as CEO is try to create a lot of connections between the Qualcomm of the early days with the Qualcomm of today, regardless of our size.", "When I became CEO, I had the very first town-hall meeting with all the employees. That was right after we had done our investor day presentation where we unveiled the new strategy of the company.", "I didn’t tell anybody — not even the teamed that helped me prep, because I want to make it a surprise — but I asked our founder, Dr. Irwin Jacobs, to be a special guest during my town-hall meeting to tell all of the new engineers at Qualcomm his advice on what’s really important when we think about the future of our company.", "I tell people, we are the world’s largest startup company and we need it to stay that way. We need to stay, nimble and fast, never be complacent.", "Another thing that is unique about our culture, when I compare and contrast with some of our tech peers, is that we have a culture that is very collaborative.", "There’s not a lot of secrets, people don’t work in silos. One thing that I do — and I started doing this not without some opposition, but it was the right thing to do — every year, I put together an entire strategy on one piece of paper.", "I’ll tell you, unfortunately, it’s a big piece of paper. It’s not small, but we call it strategy on a page.", "We give that to every single employee in the company, it doesn’t matter what you do. That has proven to be incredibly powerful, because people know, when they come to work every day, how they are part of that company strategy.", "What they are doing, what their contribution is, and what their imprint is that they have on the strategy at the end of the day.", "Because we have a lot of smart people, it’s not about just the top management of the company telling them what to do.", "People can evolve and build on that strategy in incredible ways. I think that’s all part of how I define the Qualcomm culture.", "Like I said, in this hybrid work environment we are working very hard to try to preserve it, because it’s really important for our future.", "That’s amazing. Do you think that the employees, from all levels, feel that they’re kind of imagining and realizing that future?", "You explained this high-speed connectivity and how it’s going to be important to all kinds of businesses for years to come.", "Do you think, then, that when they’re working, they feel that whatever contribution they’re making is making that future?", "I think so. It’s interesting to ask this question, because that’s something I measure. Every time we have an all-hands meeting, we ask employees on an online survey right after the meeting to rate their confidence in the business.", "We’ve been up there in the 90%-plus, sometimes in the high 90%. I even joke with people, I say, “Look, this meeting was a three-hour meeting.", "If the confidence is low, we’re going to make it a five-hour meeting.”", "But it’s incredibly powerful to really empower the organization with the strategy, to make everybody understand there is some logic to what we’re doing.", "What is the end game? What part can they play in this whole story? I think that’s the power of aligning an entire organization, it’s really incredible.", "I think the answer to your question is, I do feel that our employees understand and know what role they can play, and they believe in the future of the company.", "I’m always struck by the fact that so many employees at Qualcomm can talk products and things that you’re creating, even if they’re not the inventor or the ones on the front lines dealing with it.", "Like with Snapdragon, which is a suite of chips. It’s very popular, there’s a lot of fans for it. I’m always struck by the fact that you can talk to anybody at the company and they’ll explain it.", "I’m curious — definitely explain what Snapdragon is and why it has so many fans. What is it that you do that makes everybody feel that that is theirs?", "Well, I think first, we’re primarily an engineering company. The absolute majority of our employees are engineers.", "We also have a very unique organizational structure. Since the beginning of the company, from our founder, we want to centralize engineering organization so that there’s a lot of synergies and exchanges of information.", "We incentivize a lot of exchange of information and the spread of knowledge within the organization.", "The second aspect is the conversation we just had, which is, there’s an incredible amount of value in over-communicating.", "Not only the strategy, but also what we are going to build and how our products are going to make a difference, how they’re going to be differentiated.", "What are the key areas where we want to pursue excellence? That enables the various groups of employees in the company to figure out, based on their area of expertise, how they can build into and execute the plan.", "As a result, most people in the company today, they know exactly where we’re going, know exactly what we need to do, and know what parts they have to play in this whole game plan.", "Seeing around the corner and anticipating the future for your customers is something I know you do at Qualcomm, it’s one of your strongest traits.", "What advice would you give to other leaders who are planning for the future and are listening to the show right now?", "Well, that’s a difficult question. In in a bizarre way, I think the most powerful things and the most clear technology transitions are, identically, very simple.", "They’re not complex. There’s actually beauty in the simplicity. What it is is really thinking about the actual problem that technology needs to solve.", "I’ll tell you this by telling a little bit of a story about the company — I’ll start with the past, and then I’ll bridge to the conversation on the future.", "When we started, the reason Qualcomm invented CDMA and used CDMA as a digital cellular technology — which became the foundation of 3G cellular — was to solve a very simple problem.", "We saw the value proposition of having a phone and for you to carry your phone with you. That was the cellular experience.", "How do we make sure that everybody in the world could have a cellphone? How do you make use of the radio spectrum — that was basically walkie-talkie, that was analog cellular — in the way that everybody could have a cellphone?", "That was the basis of creating CDMA. Then, the next big challenge for the company was, could we bring broadband data to a cellphone?", "Well, once you bring broadband data through the cellphone, you need the cellphone to become a computer.", "Can we create a set of technologies that enable a computer to fit in the palm of your hand? That’s what gave birth to the smartphone and our processing capabilities in our semiconductor business, versus being just focused on radio communications.", "Where we are right now is thinking, what is the next computing platform? How do you bring the technologies that have been pioneered and expanded in mobile to every single device outside the data center and connect them to the data center?", "For example, when I think about the next computing platform, we may have an argument whether that’s going to take five years or 10 years, but we know that there’s a lot more that you can do with this computer in the palm of your hand, with a smartphone, that right now is artificially limited by the screen size.", "So, if you could make the next computing platform fully immersive augmented-reality glasses, you no longer have the limitation of the small screen.", "And when you think about high-speed connectivity to the cloud, you don’t even have the limitation of computing power.", "You can have unlimited computing, as much computing as you need, as you tap the ability of the cloud.", "So if we understand that that is the direction we’re all going, if we have that clarity of vision, then how do we think about the technologies that will make that a reality?", "This second part of the answer may not be applicable to everyone in every company. But that’s something that I had said when we were trying to commercialize 5G and trying to get technologies such as millimeter wave, which is higher frequencies — frequencies of 20 gigahertz or all the way to the high 40s — to work in a cellphone environment.", "Everybody said it was impossible, it’s not going to work in a full mobility environment. We’ve proven it is.", "Verizon’s 5G network has millimeter wave. So it’s about, can we make the impossible inevitable? Can we use that mode of thinking, especially when we think about some of those technologies?", "I think that’s kind of what has been driving us to be really pushing the roadmap and innovation forward.", "Now, President Biden recently signed the CHIPS Act, which is set to transform that whole industry, the semiconductor manufacturing landscape.", "How are you working to adapt and leverage the changes that are coming in the industry? It’s not even adapt; how are you leading?", "Because everything you do seems to be leading. So, how does that affect you and how are you taking full advantage of this?", "This is actually a great development for the semiconductor industry. It was incredible to see bipartisan support to get the thing done.", "I will start, Alan, by telling you that we all learned something with the supply chain crisis of semiconductors.", "I think we all learned that semiconductors are very important. They are required to build F150 pickup trucks, to any home appliance, to PCs, to phones, to everything.", "I think the current society runs on semiconductors. Our cloud economy runs in semiconductors.", "A company like Qualcomm — which is the largest fabless semiconductor company — if we don’t have a resilient and geographically diversified supply chain, it’s a problem.", "Now, yes, it’s easy for me to talk about it being a problem for Qualcomm, a fabless company. But it’s a problem for our society.", "We saw what happens if we don’t have access to semiconductors. It is a critical ingredient when we think about the economy and everything else that is happening with digital transformation, with every enterprise, with a more sustainable future for everybody.", "It all relies on things that are going to be built on top of a semiconductor.", "If you look at the current situation, you have a high concentration in Asia. If you put geopolitics aside, just think about natural disaster alone.", "You have a very high concentration in Taiwan, and then in Korea, of all the semiconductor production of the world.", "The US CHIPS Act, in combination with the EU Chips Act — combine the two of them, it’s almost like $95 billion of funds — is to create incentives so that those two geographies become competitive for companies to install manufacturing capacity.", "At the end of the day, this is good for Qualcomm and it is good for everybody else, because it’s such an important ingredient of the of the future economy.", "You were elected the chairman of the US Semiconductor Industry Association this year. I’m curious, with the CHIPS Act now having passed, I imagine that changes your priorities for the Association going forward?", "Look, one of the key priorities of the SIA was to get that US CHIPS Act passed and to it get into law, to get it into the process of implementation, to build manufacturing capacity for semiconductors in the United States.", "That will continue to be the mission. The way we look at it, I think the importance of having a fabless company in the chair position this year is, as a fabless company, we’re going to be the customer of those manufacturing plants that are a result of the CHIPS Act.", "If you look at today, we’re the number two customer of TSMC in Taiwan — we’re a very close second to Apple, which is the number one.", "We’re the number one customer of Samsung in Korea. We’re the number one customer of GlobalFoundries in the United States.", "We’re the number one customer of SMIC in China. So if you build the foundry, you need the customer. I think that’s the role that we can play.", "That’s why we have been very involved with all of our manufacturing partners as it a relates to building capacity in the United States and Europe.", "So you’ve got 50,000 employees. You have customers of all shapes and sizes — I love when you talk about the transformation in the automobile industry.", "You’ve got technology impacting every corner of the globe. You have so many stakeholders to keep in mind.", "What are your thoughts on stakeholder capitalism, and how have you thought to respond to a movement that’s out there, not just for Qualcomm?", "How do you make business be more responsible and take that on that responsibility? How do you deal with that, both internally but also, frankly, externally?", "Let me start by talking about the role of the industry, indirectly, in a lot of the conversations that happen today.", "I would argue, Alan, that we are not getting the credit we deserve for the incredible transformations we make.", "Let’s start by talking about, can we make everything more energy efficient? Can we make economic growth a lot more sustainable, focused on sustainability?", "We don’t use a lot of energy, given the nature of our business. But if you look at what we have done indirectly… Look at your phone today.", "You don’t have a portable music player. You don’t have a portable video player anymore. You don’t have a camera anymore.", "The number of devices that got incorporated into the smartphone, and therefore, the resulting efficiency and energy consumption is incredible.", "The smartphone became the number one consumer electronic device.", "But it doesn’t stop there. Look, for example, at the 5G contribution. As everything becomes connected and becomes more intelligent, we have indicated that 5G has a massive contribution to the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions in the United States.", "I can go even to say, a fully mature 5G network with its benefits for the automotive industry, including intelligent transportation, could have a reduction in the order of 20%-plus.", "So, I think the technology transformation that we see right now across virtually every enterprise — using things that we do, such as advanced connectivity; high-performance, low-power computing; and on-device artificial intelligence — has made an incredible contribution that I think, as an industry, we’re probably not getting credit for.", "But we’ll keep pushing forward, because it’s the right thing to do.", "I think the second part of your question is… It’s fascinating, it may be that’s a broader conversation.", "But it’s fascinating to see how the technology that we have developed has empowered people. Just the look at how the smartphone, the ability to communicate and be heard, has empowered people.", "It’s been part of this incredible opportunity to listen to a lot of different opinions, and this society is very vocal.", "I think that’s a good thing. That’s what I kind of said early on; one of the motivations for a lot of the engineers at the company is that the work that we do will change the society, and you’ll be able to see it the impact.", "I cannot think of anything that has empowered more people than the smartphone.", "That’s amazing. Now with 5G technology still being rolled out, it has the potential to impact business kind of like you’re talking about with the smartphone, in the future as well as what it’s done to us today.", "What impact do you think that you’ll have on business across a variety of industries? And then, how should business leaders be thinking about the rollout of 5G, how it impacts their thinking, planning and doing?", "This is a great question. Look, 5G is a very transformative technology. I’ll go back to the conversation I had with you before about every generation of wireless.", "What was the problem to be solved? The problem to solve with 5G is, could we design an air interface — like a radio communication interface for phones — that will deal with the following directives: Can we build a gigabit society, where everybody has gigabit speeds, like a wireless fiber-type space?", "Can we deal with congestion? A simple problem that 5G solves is, if you go to a concert or a stadium today with 4G, you don’t have enough bandwidth.", "You can’t record high-definition video and upload it to social media. 5G comes to deal with congestion and makes sure that everybody has access to gigabit speeds.", "And then, can that be a universal, last-mile connectivity for everything, across not only phones, but every single device around the clock?", "I think what we’re starting to see right now is that it has not been designed just for phones; it is designed for those billions of devices out there.", "We’re starting to see the impact in a number of different industries as they go through the process of digital transformation.", "Let me take healthcare as an example. I’m just going to give some example of the early demonstrations we’ve had when we’re rolling out 5G.", "So in the UK, one of the things that got deployed was 5G-connected first responders, 5G-connected ambulances.", "So you could have a first responder come in. By the time you put the person inside the ambulance, you now have the ability to do connected-to-5G image exams.", "You can do like an ultrasound, and then you have the reliability and the bandwidth to stream that to the hospital.", "The triage is already happening, the diagnosis is already happening. That’s having a very positive impact.", "Another example is the broad application of telemedicine, which we saw really happened during the pandemic.", "Now let me change to retail. When you go think about retail, retail business has changed dramatically.", "Now, every retail company has to add ecommerce on top of their retail operations, especially the brick and mortar.", "We see an incredible amount of transformation enabled by the combination of 5G; high-performance, low-power computing; and artificial intelligence on how you manage real-time inventory.", "You have to manage the inventory at the shelf, because you’re selling both to people in the store as well as people online and you need to manage inventory at the shelf.", "You have to deal with a completely different experience of how you navigate to the store to pick up somebody’s order, how to do self-checkout.", "Then I’m going to move the conversation to energy. We’re working with a utility company in Europe with 5G-connected substations.", "You can basically have a digital twin of the entire grid and be able to increase the operating point of the grid, which means it becomes more efficient.", "The list is countless. I think that 5G, combined with high-performance computing, on-device artificial intelligence, and on-demand computing, is really transforming every enterprise.", "One last topic I want to mention is this, Alan: one of the least understood capabilities of 5G is what we call on-demand computing.", "I’ll explain this because it’s very, very powerful. If you think of 5G as this fiber-type link between your device — whether your device is a phone, a robot, a computer — to the cloud, you can think about them as the same computer, just connected together.", "So if you need more computing power, you can just harness on-demand the power of the cloud.", "You probably hear companies like Microsoft and Satya — who is somebody I really admire — talking about the future of computing as hybrid computing.", "I agree with him 100%. You are going to make seamless the cloud and the device, which is completely transparent to you.", "Think about this, for example, when we think about the new hybrid work environment. When the pandemic hit in early 2020, we had to cancel our presence in Mobile World Congress in Barcelona, it got cancelled.", "But we decided to have a virtual event and have a demonstration. One of things we showed… and nobody really talked about it, I was so surprised.", "I said, “Why is nobody talking about this? This is so incredible.” And this was the very beginning of the pandemic.", "We showed a laptop, just an ultra-portable laptop, and somebody was doing professional 8k video editing in the cloud, connected to 5G.", "It was just doing the workload in the cloud, it was completely transparent to you. In normal circumstances, you need a big workstation to do it.", "We said, “This is the future.” Well, interesting. Then all of a sudden, everybody got sent home and people could not carry a workstation from their office.", "That’s the moment people realized, the future of computing is hybrid computing. 5G can play an important role.", "I think that’s an incredible capability of 5G that is not very well understood today.", "That’s fascinating, and obviously, illuminating about where we’re going and where the future is going to be.", "You’ve had, Cristiano, an amazing career. You’re young, so you’ve got many years and many achievements still to come.", "What advice would you give to aspiring men and women who would like to be CEOs, or are newly named CEOs, who are listening to the show?", "I also think that you’re a great example of someone who empowers people around you. You don’t have to be a CEO to be a great leader, and you’ve empowered wonderful people around you who are making an enormous difference in a teamwork environment and collaborative environment.", "I just want to remind everybody you’re listening to “Leadership Matters” on SiriusXM and at leadershipmattersshow.com.", "I’m your host, Alan Fleischmann, and I’m here with Cristiano Amon, who’s the President and CEO of Qualcomm.", "We’re talking about the fascinating future that Qualcomm is delivering on, imagining the future that technology is going to deliver on, and discussing life lessons and some leadership lessons that this remarkable CEO is sharing with us as well.", "Thank you, Alan. I’ll answer that question by saying, I don’t know if the advice is going to be any good, because I’m going to give it for free.", "But the advice that I always gave myself as I managed my career... Really, it’s a couple of things.", "First, set the bar high. Have a goal which is very ambitious. I think that really worked well for me, and I think once you set that bar, then you needed to focus on understanding how you get there.", "Second thing: surround yourself with people that are better than yourself and can do your job better than you do.", "That’s a number-one, I think, recipe for success. If I look at my career, the ability to really identify and, as you said, empower people… The power of people is really incredible, especially if you align everybody.", "The other thing is… It’s interesting. Qualcomm has had, and it still has, a very matrix-kind of environment.", "People in our company don’t exercise leadership based on the org chart, that’s not enough. I think the ability to exercise leadership by influencing people, by being able to bring everybody on board and share your vision, has also been very important for me.", "It’s old school, in my opinion, the CEOs who want to be feared. I don’t want to be feared. I want to be perceived as a member of the team.", "It’s just a privilege to be able to lead a lot of smart people. It’s about being recognized as a leader and respected, based on what you can bring to the decisions and how you actually bring people together.", "So that’s some advice that has been very useful for me in my career. Last one is, I learned something from a mentor which was really helpful.", "I always tried to understand the line that divides my area of competence from my area of incompetence.", "Once you really understand where that line is, then you know what you need to do to move that line forward.", "I think most people don’t spend time understanding what you’re really good at and what you’re not good at.", "It’s that saying, you don’t know what you don’t know. I think that has been very useful and helpful for me, especially when I think about the people that I want to have in my organization.", "I try to get a lot of people that are really, really good in the areas that I’m not. That has been very useful for me my entire career.", "I love that you mentioned your mentors. That’s an important thing that, I know, is a big part of the culture at Qualcomm, it’s a big part of your journey.", "You celebrate mentorship and you celebrate the mentors that have been in your life — some of your family members, I’m sure, your parents, but also people on the outside.", "Tell us a little bit about the mentors and how you would encourage others to not only seek out mentors, but create a culture of mentorship.", "Absolutely. It’s really important. Look, I think that’s one of the reasons why I’m trying to, in this hybrid work environment, make sure that a few days in the week, people can still come to the office and have an experience of meeting other people and exchange ideas, so people that have been in the company and have experienced it can share it.", "That’s a very important part of our innovation culture.", "And how do you deal with work-life balance? It’s a terrible term, I don’t believe it exists. I think there’s no such thing as that balance.", "But you’re very committed to your family and you’re very committed to community. How do you how do you manage that and manage being CEO?", "That’s, I think, a very difficult topic. I think it’s probably true for our company that… I agree with you, work-life balance is a difficult equation.", "Especially in our industry, which is very fast paced, and in a company like Qualcomm right now, which is transforming.", "I’m not doing as well in this area as I would like. But speaking about what is right, I think you have to find some balance.", "At least for me, you need to have time to spend with your family, you need to have time to do things that are going to be good for you, you need to have time to think.", "It’s about making use of every opportunity you have.", "But that also speaks to, when you’re talking about work-life balance… I want to use this one more time to talk about the importance of the company culture.", "If you think about a very bad work-life balance, what you realize is you’re spending as much time with your co-workers — and sometimes, more time with your co-workers — than you’re spending with your own family.", "So they need to be family too. And I think that it’s important to have a very good culture, especially as we deal with the amount of time we spend at work.", "You’ve been listening to “Leadership Matters” on SiriusXM and leadershipmattersshow.com. I’m your host, Alan Fleischmann.", "Cristiano Amon, the President and CEO of Qualcomm, has been our guest.", "Cristiano, it has been such a pleasure to talk about the future, to talk about what you, your colleagues, and team are building a Qualcomm to envision that future.", "I know it’s in good hands.

In either case, Qualcomm seems confident in terms of beating the Arm Cortex designs, which bodes well for next-gen Snapdragons.", "Amon’s comment that if Arm is able to build a better CPU than Qualcomm’s own designs is also reminiscent of the company’s previous generation custom CPU endeavours: the last time the company had employed a custom microarchitecture was in the 2016 Snapdragon 820 with its Kryo cores.", "Competing Cortex cores had been faster and more power efficient in a smaller area footprint, which lead the company to use those designs instead, and eventually leading to Qualcomm dissolving its CPU design teams – a decision which later ended up with no in-house design capabilities up until the recent NUVIA purchase.", "Yeah, until it gets beaten consistently for a few quarters, and you end-up back in the dust bin with Kry o 820.", "and later the Centriq.

I do think it's probably bad for most of ARM's customers, in the long run, and therefore the entire ARM ecosystem.", "But, that's not really the government's purview. It's not as if they're buying out a direct competitor, which is usually the grounds for rejecting mergers & acquisitions.", "There are really just a couple small overlaps between them.", "Honestly what are you talking about? Mali graphics covers over half of the graphics solutions on the market at this point.", "Arm's Mali hardly competes with Nvidia's graphics. Who exactly has a choice of implementing Mali graphics or Nvidia graphics and will be losing choice if Nvidia buys Arm?", "Practically speaking, Arm's competitive offerings will be made better because Nvidia's graphics IP will eventually be offered to customers as well and it will be preferable to Mali in many instances.", "But that won't come as a result of loss of choice in the market. And it's not like there aren't other graphics providers besides Arm or Nvidia in the business sectors where each of them operate, anyway.mode_13h - Saturday, July 3, 2021 - link", "> Mali graphics covers over half of the graphics solutions on the market at this point. Nvidia only slightly overlaps with their top-tier offering, and hasn't traditionally offered it as standalone IP (although they've announced a deal with Mediatek that amounts to that).", "It's not obvious whether Nvidia can or has any desire to try and scale down its solutions to compete with Mali's lower tiers.", "Also, I've read that the top teir Mali isn't terribly popular. I think Mediatek was its main customer.at_clucks - Saturday, July 3, 2021 - link", "Buying a competitor from the same field (graphics) but not the same market (mobile vs. datacenter, or highend vs. lowend) is even worse as it gets you closer to having the entire market.", "Don't confuse the Arm ecosystem with Arm's customers. Firstly, I think NVIDIA buying Arm is good for most of Arm's customers compared to any reasonable alternative.", "But it's definitely good for the ecosystem. To say one thinks it's bad for the ecosystem is to say that one thinks NVIDIA is going to make a mistake.", "NVIDIA certainly has no intention of damaging the ecosystem of their purchase. They don't have any reason to shut it down (sometimes companies do buy properties to shut them down).", "It's certainly good for the expansion of Arm into new areas such as Arm in the datacenter and Arm in OpenRan.", "And actually, it doesn't matter so much if it's \"good\" for Arm's current customers or not. A concern might be if it were particularly disruptive for a significant segment.", "But the basic question is whether it causes a problem for free and fair competition in the market as a whole."]}

Dorner explained for a 1997 article in the New York Times CyberTimes that it was because of a short story he had read in college: “Why I Live at the P.O,” by Mississippi writer Eudora Welty.", "Working intently on an email program, Dorner said “I felt like I lived at the post office.”", "In 1991, Qualcomm, a communications company in San Diego famous for CDMA cellular communications technology, licensed Eudora from the University of Illinois.", "Dorner was eventually hired by them to continue to develop it, working remotely from his home in Illinois.", "Qualcomm’s motivations were several. They knew that the internet would fuel the need for wireless data, and they thought that email would be one of the drivers.", "They also thought it prudent to diversify beyond ICs for wireless technology into software applications.", "But Eudora as a Mac-only product wouldn’t cut it. Qualcomm project manager John Noerenberg assigned Jeff Beckley and Jeff Gehlhaar in San Diego the task of making an MS-DOS and then a Windows version of the program.", "“The style of the company was to put an MS-DOS or Macintosh computer on each employee’s desk—whichever most suited their needs and their personal preference,” he said.", "“We required email software that was internet-savvy, and platform agnostic. There wasn’t anything commercially available that satisfied either of those goals, much less both.”", "Initially Eudora was only used internally at Qualcomm. It was well-received.

There was this great feeling about the software, and everybody really loved it.”", "“But,” Noerenberg recalls, “postcards don’t pay the bills.” He faced management pressure to stop spending money on a free product.", "“In 1993 I hatched the idea that if we could somehow convince Qualcomm there was money in an internet software business, we could turn this into a product and we’d get to keep doing what we loved.”", "Eudora was soon commercialized as a paid version for $19.95. There was still a free version, now supported by advertisements.", "By 2001, over 100 person-years of development had been invested in the Windows and Macintosh versions.", "The paid version eventually sold for as much as $65, and it was aggressively marketed by Qualcomm.", "After 15 years, Qualcomm decided in 2006 that Eudora was no longer consistent with their other major project lines, and they stopped development.", "A likely factor was the increasing adoption of Microsoft Outlook as an email client for corporations.", "Outlook was preloaded for free on many PCs, and companies often standardized on it along with the rest of the Microsoft suite of office productivity products.", "Other free email clients were also available. So regardless of how successful Eudora was, it was never going to be a business big enough to “move the needle” for a company of Qualcomm’s size.", "The last Qualcomm versions of Eudora, 7.1.0.9 for Windows and 6.2.4 for Macintosh, were released on October 11, 2006.", "To provide a “soft landing” for the millions of Eudora users, Qualcomm generously sponsored the creation of a new compatible open-source version based on Mozilla Thunderbird.", "For some time they paid the salaries of the programmers working on it, which included Steve Dorner, Jeff Beckley, Dale Wiggins, Geoff Wenger, Matt Dudziak, and Mark Charlebois.", "A beta of the new version 8.0 was released in August 2007.

At the CES show in January, AT&T announced it was collaborating with Intel on drones.", "“I think that we are striving to be the premier network provider in this category, and we want to be the premier service provider today and in the future,” Walsh said.", "The new partnership with Qualcomm positions AT&T to establish some learnings and prepare for what customers want now and in future use cases.", "Qualcomm gets OK to test drones in Class B airspace at its San Diego campus", "U.S. operators have big role to play in drones, says Small UAV Coalition leader"]}

new, many of our customers have difficulty accurately forecasting their product requirements and estimating the timing of their new product introductions, which ultimately affects their demand for our products.", "Historically, because of this limited visibility, actual results have been different from our forecasts of customer demand.", "Some of these differences have been material, leading to excess inventory or product shortages and revenue and margin forecasts above those we were actually able to achieve.", "These differences may occur in the future, and the adverse impact of these differences between forecasts and actual results could grow if we are successful in selling more products to some customers.", "In addition, the rapid pace of innovation in our industry could render significant portions of our inventory obsolete.", "inventory levels could result in unexpected expenses or increases in our reserves that could adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition.", "Conversely, if we were to underestimate customer demand or if sufficient manufacturing capacity were unavailable, we could forego revenue opportunities, potentially lose market

scarce engineering resources in pursuit of a single customer opportunity.", "We may not win the competitive selection process and may never generate any revenue despite incurring significant design and development expenditures.", "These risks are exacerbated by the fact that some of our customers’ products likely will have short life cycles.", "Failure to obtain a design win could prevent us from offering an entire generation of a product, even though this has not occurred to date.", "This could cause us to lose revenue and require us to write off obsolete inventory, and could weaken our position in future competitive selection processes.", "After securing a design win, we may experience delays in generating revenue from our products as a result of the lengthy development cycle typically required.", "Our customers generally take a considerable amount of time to evaluate our products. The typical time from early engagement by our sales force to actual product introduction runs from nine to twelve months for the consumer market, to as much as 36 months or more for the cable operator and telecommunications infrastructure markets, and beyond 36 months in the wired and wireless infrastructure markets.", "The delays inherent in these lengthy sales cycles increase the risk that a customer will decide to cancel, curtail, reduce or delay its product plans, causing us to lose anticipated sales.", "In addition, any delay or cancellation of a customer’s plans could materially and adversely affect our financial results, as we may have incurred significant expense and generated no revenue.", "Finally, our customers’ failure to successfully market and sell their products could reduce demand for our products and materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.", "If we were unable to generate revenue after incurring substantial expenses to develop any of our products, our business would suffer.", "Our operating results are subject to substantial quarterly and annual fluctuations and may fluctuate significantly due to a number of factors that could adversely affect our business and our stock price.", "Our revenue and operating results have fluctuated in the past and are likely to fluctuate in the future.", "These fluctuations may occur on a quarterly and on an annual basis and are due to a number of factors, many of which are beyond our control.", "• | changes in end-user demand for the products manufactured and sold by our customers; |", "• | the receipt, reduction or cancellation of significant orders by customers; |", "• | fluctuations in the levels of component inventories held by our customers; |", "• | market acceptance of our products and our customers’ products; |", "• | our ability to develop, introduce and market new products and technologies on a timely basis; |", "• | the timing and extent of product development costs; |", "• | new product announcements and introductions by us or our competitors; |", "• | incurrence of research and development and related new product expenditures; |", "• | seasonality or cyclical fluctuations in our markets; |", "• | significant warranty claims, including those not covered by our suppliers; |", "• | loss of key personnel or the shortage of available skilled workers; |", "• | impairment of long-lived assets, including masks and production equipment; and |", "• | the effects of competitive pricing pressures, including decreases in average selling prices of our products.", "These factors are difficult to forecast, and these, as well as other factors, could materially adversely affect our quarterly or annual operating results.", "We typically are required to incur substantial development costs in advance of a prospective sale with no certainty that we will ever recover these costs.", "A substantial amount of time may pass between a design win and the generation of revenue related to the expenses previously incurred, which can potentially cause our operating results to fluctuate significantly from period to period.", "In addition, a significant amount of our operating expenses are relatively fixed in nature due to our significant sales, research and development costs.", "Any failure to adjust spending quickly enough to compensate for a revenue shortfall could magnify its adverse impact on our results of operations.", "We are subject to the cyclical nature of the semiconductor industry.", "The semiconductor industry is highly cyclical and is characterized by constant and rapid technological change, rapid product obsolescence and price erosion, evolving standards, short product life cycles and wide fluctuations in product supply and demand.", "Any future downturns may result in diminished product demand, production overcapacity, high inventory levels and accelerated erosion of average selling prices.", "Furthermore, any upturn in the semiconductor industry could result in increased competition for access to third-party foundry and assembly capacity.", "We are dependent on the availability of this capacity to manufacture and assemble our all of our products.", "None of our third-party foundry or assembly contractors has provided assurances that adequate capacity will be available to us in the future.", "A significant downturn or upturn could have a material adverse effect on our business and operating results.", "The use of open source software in our products, processes and technology may expose us to additional risks and harm our intellectual property.", "Our products, processes and technology sometimes utilize and incorporate software that is subject to an open source license.", "Open source software is typically freely accessible, usable and modifiable.

I mean, this is a business is fundamentally a better shape, but there were some unforced errors along the way that we're committed in regard to forecasting, there's employee attrition.", "Dan Springer, to be fair, took his lumps here recently talking about how they did such a great job of fulfilling demand during a tough time.", "That demand more or less just showed up on their doorstep though. They didn't do as great a job. They took their eyes off the ball in creating demand.", "I think that could be where the concern for this business is today. Perhaps there's another shoe to drop.", "It's hard to say.

Darden has always been very good about using its size to its advantage and keeping prices low, maximizing efficiencies, and reaching every level of consumer from the lower-end to the higher.", "It certainly feels like they've been able to keep that ball rolling here over the last couple of years, which have been a tough time for really all restaurant businesses.", "But to your point there on the numbers, total sales up 14.2 percent. That was driven by a same-store restaurant sales of 11.7 percent.", "Now, like you said, Olive Garden drives the bus. That's the biggest contributor to the business, and those comps were up 6 and 1/5 percent.", "But the fine dining to your point, 34 and 1/5 percent, Chris, people wanted to treat themselves this quarter it sounds like.", "That's all very encouraging. I think the 10 percent boost to the dividend from a quarter ago is a sign of strength as well.", "Interestingly, what Darden does, and you heard the on the call a lot, they continue to under-price inflation and their competition.", "Inflation has really been a key theme for a lot of these calls. They continue to focus on under-pricing inflation in their compensation to present a value proposition and bring people in.", "It certainly worked out very well for them on Mother's Day. It was the highest sales day ever for Olive Garden and the second highest guest count day in history.", "Interestingly also, on staffing, right now they have more managers per restaurant than pre-COVID times.", "So at the manager level they are doing great. They're back to basically pre-COVID levels on the team member side as well.", "Though they did note there's some pockets of restaurants where there's some staffing issues. But generally speaking, in a world where staffing in the service industry has been very difficult, it feels like Darden has managed their way pretty well and that is playing out on the business.", "Chris Hill: Am I the only who thinks that when earnings season hits up in July and August we're going to hear the phrase staffing issues for more than a couple of retailers and restaurants out there?", "Jason Moser: I feel like we will and it feels like Darden's put themselves in a pretty good spot where this is concerned.", "Chris Hill: KB Home's second-quarter profits and revenue came in higher-than-expected and shares up nearly 15 percent this week.", "Matty, you watch real estate and housing more than anyone I know. What, if anything, does a home-builder like KB Home tell us about the housing market?", "Matt Argersinger: Well, it tells us a pretty good story, I think. I was looking at KB Home's results and to me they told us exactly what I think most of us think is going on with the housing market, which is housing market is not crashing.", "It's not falling off a cliff by any stretch. People are still buying homes, especially in strong markets like the Southeast, Southwest, and even California, where KB Home does a lot of its building.", "There has been some moderation though, as we've seen, interest rates, mortgage rates surge higher really historically over the past few months.", "If you look at KB's result, even though revenue and margins were higher, that's really mostly reflective of higher home prices.", "Deliveries, on the other hand, were flat. Orders have actually come down and cancellations have picked up a little bit.", "To me, KB Home going up as much as it did recently is really just a relief rally because home-builders have just been hit really hard.", "You got the higher revenue, higher margins, but lower growth. I think that's the same story a lot of home-builders are telling right now.", "The one disagreement that I have with KB is their guidance. It has been a little worried. They're guiding that the average selling price is going to keep moving higher to about $500,000.", "Right now it's around $490,000. That strikes me as pretty optimistic. I expect we're going to see a moderation in prices.", "We're going to see those orders continue to come down. I feel home-builders are probably going to protect margin more than anything else.", "They're already facing a lot of pressure on the supply side and the cost side. I'm a little concerned, but I do think the home-builders, are just being beaten down so hard, including KB Home that any decent continues.", "In other words, housing market is not crashing, good news, is going to send their stocks probably higher.", "Chris Hill: Should we be looking for similar guidance from other home-builders as well and essentially compare what they think is going to happen to home prices going forward to what KB Home is saying?", "Matt Argersinger: I think that'd be smart to do. We're going to see this coming quarter when the home-builders report what they say about the average selling prices.", "I expect a lot of the other home-builders, like NVR, and D Horton, are going to come out and say, \"Now we actually think prices are going to stay roughly flat, maybe even slightly lower over the next fiscal year, so we'll have to see.\"", "Chris Hill: This week, Kellogg announced plans to split into three separate public companies, one for breakfast cereal, one for snacks, and one for plant-based foods.", "CEO Steve Callahan is planning to run the snack business. Jason, I'm already a consumer [LAUGHTER] of both Cheez-It and Pringles", "so I might have to invest my money where my mouth is.", "Jason Moser: Well, I feel like you're probably right there. The snacks company, to my mind, seems like the more attractive of the three opportunities.", "When you look at the overall business, Kellogg has been relatively stagnant here over the last five years.", "Compound annual growth rate on the revenue side of 2.1 percent which is just nothing really to write home about.", "Although I will say, it's had a very good year to-date, stock is actually up and outperforming the market handily.", "That's nice. Chris, I just had very strong feelings on the tickers here, OK, in two ways, the cereal company's ticker better be pops, P-O-P-S", "[LAUGHTER], if not missed opportunity. For the love of God, I'm with you on Cheez-Its, [MUSIC] I'm going extra toasty, and it feels like it's a perfect opportunity for that snacks division ticker to be C-H-Z-T. If it's not Cheez-It, color me disappointed.", "Chris Hill: Jason Moser, Matt Argersinger, guys, we'll see you later in the show. Up next we will get the latest on the metaverse and the entertainment industry with Senior Analyst Jim Mueller.", "Chris Hill: Welcome back to Motley Fool Money. I'm Chris Hill. Earlier this week, The Wall Street Journal reported that Comcast and Alphabet have emerged as the top contenders to work with Netflix on the ad-supported tier of their service.", "Joining me to discuss in that and other parts of the entertainment media landscape is Motley Fool Senior Analyst Jim Mueller.", "Jim Mueller: My pleasure, Chris. How are you done?", "Chris Hill: Doing well. I want to get your thoughts on Netflix apart from this, but let's start with this story.", "Is this a lucrative opportunity for whoever wins the right to work with Netflix on advertising?", "Jim Mueller: Not right off, certainly not this year, probably not next year, it's going to take a little bit because Netflix and whoever wins, Google, Comcast, whoever, need to figure out how to serve the ads, who gets to see the ads, etc.", "It could be, but if Netflix shareholders are thinking this is going to be the savior of their company, it's going to take a few years for this to really get going.", "Chris Hill: What do you think is a reasonable success metric? What should people be looking for? Because it seems as though Netflix is very focused on launching this in this calendar year.", "Jim Mueller: Look for revenue growth as our management said at the end of the call, last quarter, I think the first quarter call, but for quite a while, Netflix's revenue growth is going to be still subscriber counts.", "How many subscribers do you have? Because remember anyone who goes to ad-based here and is willing to be served those ads, Netflix is losing money on, because they're going to lower the price.", "They have to make that up plus whatever extra they can get per person for that. If you're thinking of billions and billions of dollars of revenue from advertising, they're going to have to overcome even more billions of lost revenue because of the drop in the pricing tier.", "Chris Hill: Why do you think Netflix is going the route of partnering with someone? Certainly, Google is as experienced at advertising digitally as any business out there.", "Is it just so that they can launch this sooner? Because I'm sure there are people within Netflix who are making the argument saying, no, we should build this thing ourselves.", "Jim Mueller: You answered your own question. Yes, this is to get it out there quicker. Get someone who knows the advertising business because Hastings and Sarandos and those guys, they do not know advertising at all.", "They know content, they know subscription, they diddly on advertising. Get somebody who is experienced on that, learn from them, and in comments made today in another Wall Street Journal article, Co-CEO Ted Sarandos is quoted as saying that basically they want to end up building their own and iterating and making it their own thing, which means that this partnership is going to be a few years, maybe a decade at most, I think, just from what they were saying.", "They definitely want to do it themselves, but I think they recognize that in order to start generating more revenue, they need to get in this faster than the two year timeline they mentioned at the end of the first quarter.", "Chris Hill: What do you think the current state of Netflix is? Is this a stock that looks, certainly, it's lower priced than it was, say, a year or so ago", "and it's always fascinating to me when there is a business that is the clear leader. Let's be clear about this, all other subscribing services would love to have the number of subscribers that Netflix has.", "They're the clear leader in that category, but the stock is really beaten down right now.", "Jim Mueller: You're asking is it a value play? No, I think it's a value trap at the moment. They're in trouble.", "They lost two million subscribers this last quarter. They came in two million subscribers light against what they had guided to Wall Street, and when they issued that guidance in January, it was half of what Wall Street was expecting.", "They got pounded about that and they couldn't even make it because of a near one percent churn. For the current quarter, Q2, which they report in middle of July, they're guiding to a two million subscriber drop.", "That's the first time they've ever guided in 16 years. I've been tracking this for 16 years. That's the first time they've ever guided to a subscriber drop, and if they miss on that and the drop is three or four million, you don't want to be buying shares at today's price.", "That means the virtuous cycle of more subscribers means more revenue, means more spending on great content, which brings in more subscribers.", "That's been the driver for the company so far, but now if their subscriber count is actually beginning to go down, you're going to start running that backwards and that is death to the company.", "They need to get revenue, that's why they've finally caved on the advertising campaign, that's why they're starting to focus on very carefully", "so they don't push people away on the sharing issue of passwords and so on. I think they are reacting to things and in trouble and before investing in it again, I would like to see them start to solve these problems.", "Full disclosure, I do not longer own any shares of the company.", "Chris Hill: Earlier this month, there were reports that Netflix might be buying Roku. Certainly, the more recent reports about Comcast and Alphabet probably put all of that to rest.", "If you're a Roku shareholder, are you disappointed or are you relieved?", "Jim Mueller: As Sarandos confirmed that in the same article, we don't need it, as a quote, declining to comment on reports that Netflix could be interested in buying the streaming of Roku.", "I was quoting from the Wall Street Journal article, we don't need it. Frankly, anyone who actually thought about it said they've got six billion dollars of cash on the books, how much are they going to spend to buy Roku and what is it going to give them and how else might they use that money?", "Remember, they are spending a lot of money on that content. I don't think the Roku thing was anything more than a rumor and not even much of one.", "As a shareholder of Roku, probably relieved. Roku has pretty solid business by itself. They've just hit a little bit of rough patch and I think shareholders give that management team time to get through it, they should be all right.", "Chris Hill: Let's move away from streaming video and into the metaverse. Meta Platforms CEO, Mark Zuckerberg said this week, his goal is to have one billion people in the metaverse, each spending hundreds of dollars a year.", "Let's put aside whether or not you or I think it's going to get to a billion people and how long that will take.", "I am curious though about the commerce part in all of this. When you think about the metaverse, do you think there are public companies that are among the likely candidates to either enabled e-commerce in the metaverse or provide the entertainment or services or whatever that people are going to actually spend money on?", "Jim Mueller: Sure, advertising. That's what Facebook, I'm sorry, I can't say Meta Platforms [laughs] without cracking up.", "That's obviously where Zuckerberg is going with that, but there's so many ways to play the metaverse.", "You've got advertising, you've got companies like the Trade Desk that do a good job of placing ads where they do the most good and they'll learn from the patterns of what people do inside, whatever platform they're on about which ads would serve those people well.", "You've got Google, Alphabet, of course, and their expertise of advertising. Then you've got the platforms.", "The way a lot of people are talking about it is as if the metaverse is a single thing, it's not. It's scattered all over the place.", "You've got Facebook's version, you've got Roblox's version, and within that you've got a whole hundreds, if not thousands, of different little worlds to go explore.", "You've got live baseball that has metaverse. You see what they call stat cast, the arc of the ball, the speed of the pitch, the placement.", "All of that is using data from the real world and adding a layer of computer-generated imagery and information on top, which is what's called augmented reality, if I've got my terminology right.", "You could play into, Major League Baseball is not public, but there are companies that collect that data and provide it.", "Sportradar is probably the biggest player there. Lots of different ways to play it. If I were going to be investing in this long-term trend, I'd want to be willing to sit for at least a decade as it slowly builds out.", "It took a long time for the Internet to really get going, and this I think is bigger and requires more of a commitment by people to have some hardware permanently on, if they're going to be in it all the time.", "That is going to take longer for this to come into reality for most people.", "Chris Hill: You mentioned live baseball and that's actually where I want to wrap up because I know you're a big baseball fan.", "Apple and Peacock are each paying Major League Baseball $100 million for the rights to stream games. Amazon Prime is doing New York Yankee games on Friday nights.", "As someone who is a subscriber of ApplePlus, they are pushing the baseball on a regular basis. I'm curious if these are services that you think are going to lure people in because the larger trend, obviously, is something that I think we all talked about for a while and it took a while to get going, but it was this idea that big tech companies like Apple and Amazon would actually start bidding on live sports.", "There are people back in 2008, '09, and 2010 saying this is coming. It actually took a little bit longer.", "But do you think Apple and Peacock dipping their toe into major league baseball as waters. Do you think this is a prelude to larger things?", "Jim Mueller: Oh, definitely. Apple in addition to that baseball stuff, they are the likely winner of the NFL Sunday ticket.", "Just hasn't been announced yet but that's the speculation, which means they will have a bunch of American football games on every weekend starting probably next year.", "I think directed to you. DirecTV has the contract through the end of this year. So not not only baseball but sports in general.", "I mean, I ran across a story while thinking about this. Sinclair, the television network company there, they just launched, in fact, that went live this past week their regional sports and network valley sports as a independent streaming service to play baseball games for the five baseball teams in their regional sports network and regional sportsmen networks like yes, Yankees.", "I don't know what the ES stands for but it's the Yankee 1. Any SM covers the Boston Red Sox, all these regional sports networks, they're starting to launch their own little subscription services to this.", "Major League Baseball, of course has the whole thing, except for your regional teams for 150 a year finally, pulling it up.", "[laughs] [MUSIC] Just to watch them on my Mariner games. This is definitely happening and this is definitely a thing and you can expect more and more of it to come going forward.", "Chris Hill: Jim Mueller, good luck to your Mariner. Thanks for being here.", "Chris Hill: Up next, Jason Moser and Matt Argersinger return. I got a couple of stocks on their radar, so stay right here.", "Chris Hill: As always, people on the program may have interest in the stocks they talked about and the Motley Fool may have formal recommendations for or against.", "So don't buy or sell stocks based solely on what you hear. Welcome back to Motley Fool Money. Chris Hill here once again with Jason Moser and Matt Argersinger.", "Our email address is [email protected]. Got a question from Levi in South Dakota who writes, any updates on the activision blizzard buyout?", "We're saving to build the house and I'm wondering if this is too risky to put some of our house savings into for an arbitrage play.", "Warren Buffett likes it. So does that indicate safety? Let me just thank you for the question Levi. Let me just review for folks who haven't been following this closely as we have back in January, Microsoft announced it would buy Activision Blizzard for $95 a share.", "The deal is expected to close next year. At the moment, Activision shares are around $77. At the end of April, Warren Buffett said at the Berkshire Hathaway Annual Meeting that Berkshire owns 9.5 percent of Activision Blizzard, and it's because he said, sometimes I will see an arbitrage jail", "and I'll do it and I'm coding here, it looks like the odds are in our favor, but absolutely we can lose money on this company, fairly large sums of money depending on what happens if the deal blows up.", "So map, we can't give specific personalized guidance for Levi, but I don't know. I think the fact that Buffet himself is signaling like, yeah, we like our odds, but there's no guarantee.", "I feel like that in and of itself provides even more guidance.", "Jason Moser: That's the guidance. These can be a dangerous effort through said at first, but it's the metaphor of picking up pennies in front of a steam roller.", "In this case, it's a little different though the spread is so wide and you've got buffered behind it.", "I have to say this is one of those arbitrage plays. Just speaking from my own personal perspective, I own shares of Activision Blizzard, not because of the arbitrage play.", "I've owned the shares for years, but it's one of those situations where I do think there's probably not as much downside because of you said the stock's at 77, well, that is just slightly above where Activision's been trading the last five years.", "I feel like even if the deal falls through regulatory concerns or what have you, I don't feel like it's a situation where the stock is actually going to plummet.", "It will fall, but maybe the downside isn't as sharp as it might be, say, for another arbitrage play. So maybe one of small bet for the average investor, I don't know.", "Matt Argersinger: Jason, I feel like this is one of those situations. If you're interested, maybe make it a small percentage of your investing dollars.", "Jason Moser: Yeah, I think that's fair. The old saw goes if something bookstore seems too good to be true usually is.", "It feels like in this case I'm with Matt, it does feel like this deal likely happens, and even if it doesn't, I mean, Activision Blizzard around zone is still a good business, so the downside is relatively limited, but you go back to the funds.", "I mean, it's funds are for building a house. So this is a big deal. You don't want to put that stuff at risk.", "I think it all goes back to just these are the types of situations. Maybe you have a small portion of your portfolio that's dedicated to special situations investing, which is what this would qualify as.", "Also remember, there are going to be short-term capital gains taxes here replay depending on the type of account that you use.", "But I tend to agree with Matt, it feels like the downside in this case is probably somewhat limited.", "Chris Hill: Let's get to the stocks on our radar. Our man behind-the-glass, Dan Boyd is going to hit you with a question.", "Matt, you are up first. What are you looking at this week?", "Matt Argersinger: Chris, I am looking at eBay and the tickers, E-B-A-Y, simple as the comps, everyone knows eBay and it's still an e-commerce powerhouse.", "I mean, they did 10 billion in annual revenue last year. Still have 147 million active buyers, 17 million active sellers, so it's a huge platform, huge marketplace.", "It's just a huge big-time cash-generator. Nearly 1.8 billion in free cash flow over the last 12 months.", "They've used a lot of that cash flow to reduce share count by buybacks. They bought back over 50 percent of the stock over the last nine years.", "Trades at a 4P multiple 11, they start paying a dividend 2019. They've raised that a few times already.", "I hate disagreeing with the market, but I think eBay is way too cheap right now.", "Dan Boyd: You know, it's not too cheap, Chris. All the stuff that I want to buy on eBay [laughs] I got to tell you boys, I do like eBay as-a-service.", "It is a wonderful way to get things that are out of print or special or signed or anything that is commemorative, remember Bill or whatever.", "I love the service. I think that as the stock if it's super cheap right now, might be a good opportunity because I don't think eBay it's going anywhere.", "Jason Moser: Keeping an eye on Qualcomm ticker, Q-C-O-M, I'm going to have a good fortune next week to interview CFO Akash Palkhiwala.", "We'll be talking hopefully about a wide range of topics, things like how they're handling the ongoing supply chain issues, Apple's moves to becoming more vertical.", "They have an ongoing partnership with Microsoft and of course, their ongoing efforts in building out 5G.", "But hey, it's also worth noting dairy founding affiliate of 6G and UT, a program at University of Texas that is working on the inevitable rollout of 6G and all of its applications.", "So it should be very fun and educational interview, and folks probably know I've recommended Qualcomm and both of my services here at the fools.", "Dan Boyd: Now, Qualcomm seems like one of those stocks from the '90s that has just stuck around for whatever reason, I'm sure that they have been very important in developing technology and stuff in the past.", "But all I can figure when they think of Qualcomm is like a landfill lines.", "Jason Moser: Well, Dan, that's not really a question, but I'm going to put it into question forum and added to the interview next week.", "Chris Hill: A love the reference to landlines, Dan, of those two, do you have one you want to add to your watch list?", "Dan Boyd: You know what Chris? As much as I like the old rotary phone, I think I'm going to have [laughs] to go with eBay on this one again it's service that I love.", "Chris Hill: Matt Argersinger, Jason Moser guys, thanks so much for being here.", "Chris Hill: That's going to do it for this week's Motley Fool Money radio show. Show is mixed by Dan Boyd.", "I'm Chris Hill, thanks for listening. We'll see you next time."]}

"Moreover, 2020 is not the first time that patent litigation, especially NPE activity, has increased during times of economic struggle.", "In fact, while RPX’s analysis indicates that NPE litigation has been highly responsive to various patent reforms—for example, spiking just before the AIA took effect, and declining in the wake of the Supreme Court’s Alice decision—NPEs have also been remarkably resilient during periods of economic downturn like the one caused by COVID-19.", "NPE litigation actually increased during the 2008-2009 recession, continuing a relatively uninterrupted upward trend from 2005 and peaking in 2011, while operating company litigation slowed in 2008-2009 and did not rebound until the 2010-2011 recovery.", "Time will tell if a similar pattern will hold after the COVID-19 recession.", "See the “Marketplace Update” section below for more on how the current economic downturn may already be setting the stage for more NPE litigation in the near future, and how the assignment of patents from operating companies to NPEs continues to serve as a leading indicator of assertion campaigns to come.", "Venue Update: West Texas Took First Place as Judge Albright and the Federal Circuit Locked Horns", "In 2020, the Western District of Texas was the most popular venue for overall patent litigation (i.e., with no filter for plaintiff type) and for litigation filed by NPEs, also taking third place for operating company litigation.", "The District of Delaware, meanwhile, was the top operating company venue and the number-two district for both overall litigation (falling behind West Texas by just under 30 defendants added) and for NPE litigation (trailing West Texas by over 200 defendants added).", "The Eastern District of Texas—the favored venue of NPEs prior to the Supreme Court’s decision in TC Heartland—took third place for overall and NPE litigation but was in fifth place for operating company litigation.", "The venue rankings were the same in all three categories for litigation filed in the fourth quarter.", "As RPX has reported, the rise of the Western District of Texas can largely be attributed to District Judge Alan D. Albright, who has made no secret of his desire to attract more patent litigation to his district since taking the bench in September 2018.", "Along the way he has developed what some might call a restrictive approach to certain types of motions, with his treatment of motions to transfer for convenience grounds standing out in 2020—possibly, in part, because of the extent to which the Federal Circuit has pushed back.", "On multiple occasions during the past year, the Federal Circuit has overturned Judge Albright’s denial of convenience transfer motions.", "In July, the appellate court ruled that he improperly weighed the applicable factors to deny Adobe a convenience transfer to the Northern District of California.", "More recently, a divided Federal Circuit granted a mandamus petition from Apple, ruling in November that Judge Albright erred in concluding that a variety of the applicable factors weighed against transferring a case brought by Fortress Investment Group LLC subsidiary Uniloc 2017 LLC (also to the Northern District of California).", "Circuit Judge Kimberly A. Moore dissented, arguing that the majority’s analysis exceeded the permissible bounds of mandamus review and improperly disturbed the district court’s factual findings and conclusions.", "See RPX Insight for details on that latest appellate ruling.", "COVID-19 Update: Top Patent Venues Take Divergent Approaches to Jury Trials", "The COVID-19 pandemic has forced courts to rethink many aspects of patent litigation. While a number of district judges have moved hearings and other procedures online, the nation’s top patent venues effectively suspended jury trials for most of the summer—until District Judge Rodney Gilstrap of the Eastern District of Texas resumed patent trials in August after local infection rates began to fall.", "However, as the pandemic moved further into its winter wave, Judge Gilstrap took the notable step in late November of halting all jury trials before him after a coronavirus outbreak during a trial under another judge in the Eastern District.", "Judge Gilstrap stated that he was doing so “reluctantly” but asserted that he had no alternative—arguing that the face-to-face aspect of in-person trials is essential for due process.", "In contrast, while Judge Albright of the Western District has pushed trials back, he has not halted trials outright, adopting more of a wait-and-see approach.", "In November, he even moved a scheduled January patent trial from Austin, where the courthouse remains closed, to Waco, in an attempt to proceed on that same date.", "However, the Federal Circuit ruled on December 23 that Judge Albright moved the trial without proper authority and that doing so would require a complete convenience analysis to determine whether the entire case could be transferred to Waco.", "On December 30, Judge Albright granted the plaintiff’s emergency motion for such a transfer, also announcing that he would push the trial back to mid-February to give the defendant time to appeal.", "Meanwhile, as the recent spike in infections forced California into a second lockdown, courts in two of the state’s federal districts pushed back scheduled patent trials.", "On December 14, District Judge James V.

Techtronic Industries, commonly referred to as the “garage door” case.", "In that decision, the appellant had argued that the Federal Circuit erred by reducing the invalidated patent to a “single supposed point of novelty” rather than considering the claims as a whole.", "The ruling attracted significant interest, with Senator Thom Tillis (R-NC) arguing that the ruling highlighted both the “madness” underpinning how courts have applied Alice and the need for legislative reform.", "However, as Senator Tillis himself has lamented, the lack of consensus between stakeholders in the life sciences and tech industries on how to address Section 101 has dimmed the prospects of such reform in the near future.", "Indeed, Professor Colleen Chien recently remarked that the prospect of “Congressional action on Section 101”—as well as that of “near-term Supreme Court” intervention—“remains murky”.", "Another petition denied in November, filed in WhitServe v. Donuts, highlighted a different patent eligibility issue—the role of facts in the Alice analysis—that has become a point of contention since the Federal Circuit’s February 2018 Berkheimer and Aatrix decisions.", "In those cases, the Federal Circuit ruled that dismissal under Alice may be premature when the patent owner can establish a factual dispute over the challenged patent’s inventiveness.", "The decisions effectively give some patent owners what amounts to an early Alice defense and have led many plaintiffs to supplement their complaints with copious factual allegations regarding their patents’ alleged inventiveness.", "Patent owner WhitServe LLC argued in its Supreme Court petition that the Federal Circuit erred by unduly ignoring such factual allegations offered in its own complaint, asserting that early Alice dismissals have been granted at “unprecedented levels”.", "WhitServe’s objections notwithstanding, Berkheimer and Aatrix have actually led to a decrease in the overall Alice invalidation rate, as regularly observed by RPX in the nearly three years since those decisions came down.", "While the pre-Berkheimer invalidation rate was around two thirds, for Alice decisions issued since then, just 46% of patents have had claims invalidated.", "Adding a filter for procedural stage shows that Rule 12 and summary judgment—easily the two most common avenues for Section 101 challenges—have both been similarly affected by Berkheimer, each decreasing by about the same amount as the overall invalidation rate.", "For Rule 12—the earlier of the two stages, and the one highlighted by WhitServe—Alice decisions issued since Berkheimer and through the end of 2020 resulted in an invalidation rate just over 47% (up slightly from where that figure stood at the end of Q3), compared to around 70% before Berkheimer.", "Meanwhile, the post-Berkheimer invalidation rate at summary judgment stands at 38%, compared to a pre-Berkheimer invalidation rate of around 57%.", "RPX data also indicate that plaintiffs remain less far less successful when trying to block an Alice ruling at the Rule 12 stage than at summary judgment.", "An analysis limited to decisions that turned on Berkheimer or Aatrix, meaning a plaintiff asserted that a factual issue precluded early resolution and the court’s order actually addressed that issue, shows that courts found sufficient facts to rule about half of the time for Rule 12.", "However, the story is much different for summary judgment decisions turning on Berkheimer, for which courts found that they had sufficient facts to move forward just 30% of the time.", "Adding a filter for plaintiff type further shows that NPEs are still significantly less successful than operating companies at blocking Rule 12 challenges under Berkheimer/Aatrix, with courts finding sufficient facts to issue a ruling 57% of the time for motions against NPEs but 41% of the time for those against operating companies.", "NPEs fare even worse at the summary judgment stage, as courts found sufficient facts to rule in 75% of Alice summary judgment motions against NPEs—whereas for summary judgment motions against operating companies, courts found sufficient facts just 11% of the time.", "Overall, since the Alice decision’s June 2014 issue date and through the end of 2020, 58% of patents have had claims invalidated under its rationale.", "Patents asserted by operating companies have fared better during that period, with about half surviving Alice challenges—whereas those wielded by NPEs had an invalidation rate of around 64%.", "Patents litigated by operating companies did even better for decisions issued just in 2020, surviving Alice challenges 74% of the time in the past year.", "In contrast, just 38% of NPE-asserted patents withstood Alice motions adjudicated during that period.", "FRAND Update: Courts Address Jury Trials, Automotive Licensing, and Global SEP Licenses", "2020 proved to be an eventful year for litigation over standard essential patents (SEPs), and the fourth quarter brought a variety of significant developments in that arena in the US and abroad.", "The US: Courts Affirm Rulings on Juries in SEP Disputes", "On the domestic front, the fourth quarter saw US courts double down on caselaw confirming the role of juries in SEP disputes.", "Most recently, on December 4, the full Federal Circuit declined to revisit the court’s August decision, in IP Bridge v. TCL, that juries must resolve the question of whether a patent is essential to a given standard.", "Additionally, in October, the Supreme Court rejected an appeal in TCL v. Ericsson, in which the Federal Circuit ruled that juries must also determine royalties in SEP disputes, and that deciding such terms from the bench violates a defendant’s constitutional right to a jury trial.", "As noted above, the resulting jury trial in that case was recently delayed as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.", "The end of October also saw the Ninth Circuit opt not to rehear its August decision in FTC v.

It’s no longer just our PC or our server, but everything seems to need high-performance compute and the PC is essential once again.", "So they dynamics of the market are extremely favorable.", "The second thing I would say is [that we need] to capitalize on these data-centric transitions. It requires, as you know, massive transformation for your clients, and obviously for us, but it’s a massive transformation so that we are seen adapting and developing the new technologies that are going to enable those transformations, like 5G, like AI, like autonomous edge.", "And then the third thing is, you know in some ways fortunately but in some ways unfortunately, we’re not the only ones that have noted this massive opportunity in front of us.", "You know, competition is intense, and they never sleep. That means we have got to be on top of our game, which we have every intention to be, [especially] as we close out last year and enter this year.", "So we’re excited about the competitive landscape – sometimes I wish it wouldn’t be as intense, but I think it makes us stronger along the way.", "Intel showcasing networking, storage, Optane, compute, 5G", "So the market overview is relatively attractive. Strategically what we’ve been talking about for the last couple of years in terms of our role in this market is just to be the trusted performance leader, [one] that takes this insatiable appetite for data and makes that data relevant and actionable by analyzing it, storing it, and moving it faster.", "[This means that] whether it’s a business or a consumer going through their own digital transformation, our technologies are there to make the data that everybody's getting after increasingly relevant.", "And the third thing I would say is that we know that for us, to achieve our dreams, that requires us to transform ourselves on three fundamental dimensions.", "One, as we characterize it, and Pat I know I read every word you write (only Pat was mentioned by name), but from the CPU to the XPU.", "As the industry evolves, as workloads evolve, having a variety of architectures, enhancing our core CPU, but also adding additional architectures is increasingly important.", "Secondly, you know, from Silicon to Platform. It’s not just the hardware, but how do we couple the hardware with software and with other technologies to build platforms that can delight our customers.", "And then the third area for us have been a transformation from what we’ve characterized as the traditional IDM (Integrated Device Manufacturer) to a more modern IDM.", "This is not to get rid of the IDM, as we think it is a unique advantage of this company. But we know the industry has evolved quite a bit, we know that leveraging design disaggregation and packaging technologies that the IDM of the future is going to be a little bit different than the IDM of the past.", "That’s the third leg of our kind of transformation.", "Then to kind of bring it all together: [it’s] our intensity and focus on both execution and [the] tightly coupled re-energizing the culture of the company.", "So we’ve moving in a much more nimble way as we see opportunities to grow and [to] innovate, as opposed to protect what we built in the past.", "So that’s a little bit about what we’ve been up to.", "I also want to start with the kind of momentum entering the year. I think you guys, a year ago I flagged you know three fundamental areas that I thought were critical for us to improve execution.", "One was capacity, to ensure that we have the capacity to meet the demands of our customer base. Second was, once and for all, the ramp of 10nm.", "Third was to increase the rate of innovation of these multiple/multiplicity of architectures.", "So as we enter 2021, you know, we built some really good momentum. Obviously we have a lot more to do, but", "yeah we’ve added over $20 billion in revenue over the last five years, and we’ve been chasing it, and chasing it is disruptive.", "So we entered the year (2021) having essentially doubled our capacity over the course of the last couple of years, and we’re going into 2021 you know with a lot more capacity in place, both for 14nm but also for 10nm.", "The second area is 10nm itself. It was a year ago that we finally launched it, and during the course of the year going to second generation SuperFin, the biggest internode enhancement in transistor density ever for us.", "[It] was a big introduction during the course of the year and coupling that with our packaging technology is kind of bringing them to life.", "[It] was a really important aspect of execution on 10nm.", "Then third is the products, and just the rate of innovation. During the course of the year, whether it was beginning the year with LakeField, or 5G SOCs, FPGAs, discrete graphics, oneAPI – the amount of products that we launched during the course of the year was really good momentum.", "And I would say that maybe most importantly, the Tiger Lake launch during the course of the year, that t ramped on the new node faster than we anticipated.", "It grew better, the adoption [of Tiger Lake], the designs by our customers was more than we expected.", "So we enter the year with that momentum kind of behind us, and the opportunity really to scale as we ended the year.", "The last thing I [want] to say is about the execution as we exit the year. We launched [the] Ice Lake server product, you know, qualified it at the end of the year, started production of the third generation of Xeon Scalable processors, and will ramp it in the first quarter.", "So as you know, that was an important launch to kind of complete the portfolio of products that we have, from LakeField at the beginning of the year, all the way to server at the end of the year.", "So that’s, you know, a little bit about strategically where we’re headed, [and] the momentum we have entering the year.", "Just quickly on the things you’re going to hear about at the [press] conference on the 11th. [To] start with, I mentioned the Ice Lake Xeon Scalable.", "Next year the client business is going to, you know, show more advances and industry firsts for virtually every type of experience in every segment of the PC market.", "During the year we’ll have four families of processors, from entry to premium, a really good lineup of products during the course of the year.", "In that lineup we’ll include some real desktop innovation coming in. Greg (Bryant) or Chris (Walker) will showcase two technologies coming to market in 2021, including the 11th Gen Core desktop processor Rocket Lake, as you know, and our next generation processors, Alder Lake, which from our vantage point represents a significant breakthrough in the x86 architecture.", "So we’re really excited about the innovation on the desktop. So between server, client, mobile, and desktop, we have an exciting lineup of things as we enter the year.", "The second thing we will talk about is Silicon to Platform – we will also enhance our platform offering in the year.", "We will launch our first ever 11th Gen Core Chromebooks, based on the Evo platform, and we’re going to debut the Intel Evo vPro platform as well, which is going to feature the highest performance business PC platform with the most comprehensive hardware based security.", "So [we’re] very excited about going beyond the silicon, the platforms, not just for Chromebooks but also you’re going to hear from Annan how Mobileye is expanding its offering as well.", "That talk is about expanding autonomous vehicle efforts globally, with four new testing locations [in] Detroit, Tokyo, Shanghai and Paris, in the first part of 2021.", "[This is] basically demonstrating the ability to have that kind of rapid global deployment by leveraging the proprietary crowdsource mapping technology called RAM, or Road Experience Management.", "So [we have] really exciting announcements coming from the Mobileye team on the 11th as well.", "Just to wrap up: the demand for compute is pervasive. It’s not just the PC or the server, it’s the network, at the edge, in the car, in the retail store, in the industrial environment, and that incredible demand for compute, on billions and billions of devices, is a rich opportunity for us to expand the role that we play in our customer success.", "We feel like we have good momentum [from] 2020 in entering the year, and we’re excited to demonstrate a bunch of new innovation.", "Patrick Moorhead, Moor Insights and Analysis: Can you give the latest and greatest on 10nm?", "Bob Swan: There are several components to this. Firstly, we have three fabs ramping [up production] now.", "We’re building capacity for this year and the next couple of years, and both front-end and back-end yields have been progressing as we ramp.", "We ramped even faster in Q4 2020. With this, as yields increase, unit costs continue to come down, and gross margins get better.", "But don’t forget it’s not just about the process technology, but also the products we build – I mean, we ramped everything during 2020.", "At the end of 2020, I think in the Q3 financial call, I said that volume on 10nm was 30% higher than we expected compared to the beginning of the year.", "We have felt great about our design wins on 10nm, and look to continue ramping 10nm across all three fabs as we exit our financial year 2020, into 2021.", "Paul Alcorn, Tom’s Hardware: One of the key benefits of Intel is that it manages its own manufacturing supply chain, however recently Intel has discussed using external suppliers for key components.", "We're moving into an era, due to COVID and other political relations, where the scope for a sustained third-party supply might leave Intel on the back foot should it decide to outsource its market leading products.", "How does Intel move forward in a future where it blends its product lines with a mix of third-party derivatives, the supply and economics of which will be further removed from Intel's usual control?", "Bob Swan: Access to supply has been a critical part of Intel’s product management. A year ago, as we collectively looked into 2020, we expected that the PC market might be grow or contract by about 1%.", "It felt quite flat, and the demand profile wasn't great. Then as COVID hit, most of the industry thought that the first half of the year was going to fall off in terms of demand.", "But then in the second half of the year, demand grew like crazy and the mix of Intel’s products changed considerably.", "As a result, the whole ecosystem scrambled to gain pace, and at Intel we had to react and schedule for that.", "For Intel, this is our advantage as an IDM (Integrated Device Manufacturer). While an IDM is still dependent on its ecosystem, it helps being the allocator rather than the allocatee - it means a great deal.", "If we think about design disaggregation, where we might leverage a third party foundry process, in any discussions that we are trying, even if we don't make those agreements happen, we always have to look at how we preserve the advantages of being a [vertically integrated] IDM.", "This means the ability to leverage Intel's size and scale, especially to get preferential treatment when allocation decisions are being made.", "We've got practice in using third party resources for our commodities, and as we plan to expand and use more third party foundries, maintaining and securing the advantages to Intel’s IDM strategy is going to be critical.", "Paul Alcorn: Is there scope for Intel to consider sub-licensing leading process node technology from other foundries in order to use in its own manufacturing facilities?", "Bob Swan: Possibly. I think the strategically for Intel, the ecosystem has evolved over the last 10 years.", "If there are ways or opportunities to leverage other industry advancements, then it is going to be very front-and-center for Intel to capitalize on industry innovations.", "Intel is coming to the realization that we don't have to do all the innovations ourselves. So in that thought we might outsource, we might move to using third party IP, opening up our own manufacturing and become a foundry.", "Is there a scenario in which Intel might use another’s process technology in our own manufacturing? That's certainly possible.", "The industry is evolving and we need to leverage that innovation, within our walls or elsewhere, and take advantage.", "Mark Hachman, PCWorld: A question on the competition. If I am a PC vendor, I can buy from Intel, I can buy from AMD, or I can go find an Arm chip (or roll my own).", "With that in mind, what is the competitive advantage of Intel over the competition?", "Bob Swan: Competition makes us stronger and helps us to move faster. It’s all about the rate of innovation, and then developing a broad based product offering.", "This means providing a range of products from intro to premium, and for products to business, to the consumer, for notebooks, for desktops, and offering a predictable annual cadence of leadership.", "It comes down to Intel’s IDM advantage – at Intel it is the knowledge to the customer base is that we are not going to contain your growth.", "At Intel we need to have more capacity than needed, and Intel needs to be the allocator and have the inventory to meet the spikes in customer demand.", "Also on the knowledge – we work with engineers at these companies and co-optimize their products. We're part of their design team, not just the order taker.", "Dave Altavilla, HotHardware: Is there an update on the progress for Intel’s higher-end Xe GPUs? How is it going, and how do you see it competing in the gaming or the datacenter?", "Bob Swan: This is something that we've had a couple of goes with, as you know, when we started over two years ago.", "Rather than starting from scratch like we did with Larrabee, it was a case of how do we start but this time with integrated graphics.", "The process is about driving from integrated graphics to discrete graphics, and leveraging the same design as much as possible (to enable scale up).", "You saw the progress with Xe in 2020, with the launch of DG1, which we are very excited about. We've not given a date for DG2, but clearly we have strong intentions in this CPU to XPU space where there are multiple architectures needed.", "Intel is going to invest to expand GPU to entry up the stack over time. We will have real innovation in the next two years", "Dr. Ian Cutress, AnandTech: Given Intel's position in market, its outlook for 2021, and where the company currently stands, what matters more: its financial side or its technical side?", "Bob Swan: Technical. But they’re not decoupled – one powers the other and vice versa. Our rate of innovation, our rate of products, and our rate of investment helps one to drive the other which feeds back in.", "Dr. Ian Cutress: Intel has had a recent exodus of prominent key technical personal in 2020, such as Renduchintala and Keller.", "Where does Intel see the future of its technical expertise coming from?", "Bob Swan: Don’t forget that Intel has 70,000 engineers! Intel’s background is technical. Our model for the longest time was to hire engineers right out of their college campuses, and grow them within the system*.", "As the industry has moved on, when we think about new architectures, and the ecosystem still has to be growing from within but also we are bringing in outsiders.", "As you know, Jim left for personal reasons. When Murthy left, he was a wonderful executive, but in so many ways it was ‘how to get five engineers in the room when we’re making big decisions, not just one?’", "I think it’s the realization that we can get more diverse points of view, more technologists in the room, making big time decisions.", "As you know we’ve done substantial promotions within the company to fill those rolls, such as Ann Kelleher on technology development, Keyvan Esfarjani in manufacturing, Raja Koduri on company-wide architecture and software, and Josh Walden fills in the Jim Keller type position as we look to fill that role on a permanent basis.", "We also have Dr. Randhir Thakur from Applied Materials on our supply chain. Having 5 senior, what I’d characterize as brilliant, engineers in that room gives us more diverse thought on the technology and the future.", "Then there's also the core hardware and software engineers that work for each of them, and I'm convinced we have the best talent, by a long shot, in the world.", "Our expectations are to continue to have the best talent, and we’ll get it the same way as we have recently, which is from the campuses and the competition.", "*Ian: I often address the engineers that have been there 20+ years as Intel ‘lifers’", "As a company, it has been a tough couple of years [especially on the technology side]. But coming out of 2020, it will be the 5th best year in a row for revenue.", "We understand it's all about innovation and execution, and we're excited about what we're going to do for customers in 2021.", "Despite the short time to ask questions, there are several points to highlight.", "First, it sounds like Intel is almost certainly going to keep its fabs. Bob repeatedly stated that Intel’s key advantage is as a vertically integrated company, and being able to have the resources to scale out production in order to meet demand from customers, as well as deal with spikes in that demand.", "Obviously the question as to whether Intel will have a sufficiently competitive manufacturing technology to remain in such high demand still remains on the table for this isolated explanation, but our interpretation of this shows that keeping the fabs internal allows Intel to remain agile for its customers supply needs, something that may not be possible when using third party resources.", "To that, and secondly, the comment Bob has made about only using third party resources such that Intel has preferential treatment and maintains an IDM-like advantage (i.e., similar benefits to that of being vertically integrated).", "This has significant implications as it boils down to which third party resources Intel might consider using.", "Intel has a significant financial advantage over a number of its direct competitors in the traditional markets it plays, but for third party foundry, the competitors are different.", "Apple is TSMC’s lead partner on 5nm and won’t be outbid, whereas AMD and Qualcomm take up most of the 7nm volume now that Huawei is no longer a customer.", "TSMC has already stated that it isn’t prepared to build out additional operations just for Intel, especially if they would be temporally limited until Intel reaches parity on its own manufacturing.", "If Intel were to outbid for capacity against AMD or Qualcomm, then it puts severe question marks on the gross margin, something that Bob Swan is very keen to monitor and keep in line with Intel’s historical metrics.", "The other option would be Samsung, where Intel would have to bid against Samsung itself and NVIDIA for capacity.", "Third, that Intel could consider licensing another fab technology and integrate it into its own. To put some perspective on this, all of these fabs (between Intel, TSMC and Samsung), use mostly the same machines to build transistors on wafers.", "There are only a few companies that make the hardware, and all three have major investment in all the players.", "The differences in the technology is going to be how those steps are built up, and machine-to-machine ratio, as well as EDA tools in play.", "But much in the same way GlobalFoundries licensed Samsung’s 14nm for its own use, Intel could do the same, at least in a facility or two.", "If Intel were to do this, for example on its 7nm by licensing Samsung’s 5nm, it could re-channel research and development teams that were working on its own 7nm over to Intel’s 5nm process, where we expect the company to debut nanoribbon transistors.", "Dropping its own 7nm and licensing someone else’s technology might be an initial cost, time delay, and impact gross margins for a year or two, but focusing on its own 5nm might be what Intel needs to restart its manufacturing arm.", "The fact that Bob didn’t immediately swat it away means that it remains a valid option, especially as Intel appears to be committed to continuing to build out its fab technology (as per the first point).", "Fourth, Bob Swan when asked if technical or financial matters more to Intel, he stated the technical side matters more.", "I should note that he stated that without hesitation. A question continually asked among a number of analysts is if having a non-technical CEO is the right fit for Intel, especially at a time when Intel’s future seems to be predicated on its technical delays than anything else.", "But the fact that Bob recognizes that Intel’s technical side is where the company needs to focus gives me more hope.", "It all comes down to whether Intel can have the right technical people in the right positions being able to make decisions that don’t require months of debate.", "Fifth, the comments about Renduchintala took me by surprise. The nature of Murthy’s sudden departure from Intel in July 2020 led to a number of hushed private comments as to what exactly was happening inside the four walls.", "Suggestions have been raised that he was asked to leave, that he was forced to leave, or that he left as his position became untenable with others.", "The fact that Bob has stated that Murthy’s departure has enabled the company to add more technical voices to the future of Intel indicates that Renduchintala’s id was perhaps inflexible to commentary from similar level peers.", "Renduchintala’s hiring was widely promoted in 2015, not only for being a rare circumstance of Intel hiring from outside the company to such a senior position, but also the $8.1m signing on bonus with $17m in additional incentives (culminated in a $27m compensation package in 2019).", "It was also as a nod to the potential future of Intel, with whispers that Murthy was on the track to the CEO position and could help fix Intel’s process node delays.", "So the fact that Renduchintala left with little fanfare, along with Bob’s comments today, might imply the split was less than amicable when it came to deciding Intel’s future, at least to the point on the future of the company and how each party wanted to be involved.", "It sounds like Murthy wanted to go his way and his way only, but Intel’s management wanted more voices in the room to debate those calls.", "Perhaps this last point is a bit of a big question mark. When a company starts talking about announcements, launches, and availability, the exact position of the product can get a bit murky, because the terms of somewhat used interchangeably.", "Normally an official ‘launch’ is code for ‘we’ve started selling it and generating revenue’, which is why this is all a bit odd.", "Intel’s Ice Lake Xeon Scalable product has not had an official launch date and information event, however Bob in this Q&A stated that this 10nm silicon we’ve been waiting for has already been launched.", "To add confusion to the mix, he also mentions that production is ‘ramping’, which usually means that Intel is enabling high volume production for wider availability.", "However, the Intel press release today only states that the product is ‘entering production’. It can’t be both – either it is in production already and Intel is selling it, or they’ve started to make it.", "Normally with these Xeon products, the hyperscalers and big customers act as Intel’s testing ground, and so these customers will have been using the engineering sample hardware for several months already, sometimes in deployed servers.", "A few years ago Intel made a hubbub about its first 10nm product Cannon Lake (which the company seems to want people to forget about) being shipped for revenue at the end of 2017, however it wasn’t until Q3 2018 where Intel put it in their own NUCs for consumer use.", "Between the launch, the ramp, the production, and revenue, Intel’s messaging here is unclear. However, it is safe to assume that the big customers already have some form of it up and running.", "When Intel first announced 10nm was shipping for revenue. Click through for video", "Whichever way you slice it this was a very interesting call about Intel and the company’s future. This was done before Intel briefed us on its CES announcements, so there might be some cross over as that happens.", "But I’m glad Intel was able to snare its CEO for some time with the technical press, even if the Q&A time ended up being 15 minutes for 5/6 journalists.", "We enjoy these chances to have honest discussions about how the head of a company perceives the business they are in, as well as the vision of the company as we move forward.", "It was a very interesting first talk with Bob, and hopefully we’ll get the opportunity for many more.", "- Intel 11th Gen Desktop Rocket Lake Core i9-11900K ‘Preview’", "- Intel’s Next Gen Tremont Atom in Jasper Lake for Q1", "These were actually pretty good questions.

Moeller - Moeller Ventures LLC - https://www.moellerventures.com/", "The following report is an abbreviated version of the full patent landscape report available at https://www.moellerventures.com/index.php/blog/25-2020-articles/45-connected-health-telemedicine-patent-landscape.", "The full landscape report contains additional exhibits that are noted but not included in the report below.", "In addition, the figures and tables are interactive with figure zooming, table sorting, and keyword searching capabilities that enable more detailed querying of the tabulated information.", "The principle focus of this report is to create a broad patent landscape around the telemedicine / telehealth technology domain.", "The broad domain collection for this report was created by simply matching the keywords “telemedicine” or \"telehealth\" in the abstract, description or claims of the patent documents available in Google’s BigQuery data warehouse, in the “patents-public-data:patents” dataset, “publications” table.", "Either “telemedicine\" or \"telehealth\" must be found in a document section in order to be included in the domain collection.", "The Google patent dataset used in this analysis is current with patent documents filed through December 5, 2019.", "The resulting domain collection consists of 4,923 patent applications, of which 2,012 have been granted as patents.", "The report sections below consist of a results summary, a market intelligence brief, profiles of the notable top 25 corporate assignees, as well as tables presenting the details of the patent document landscape.", "These patent document landscape tables cover a profiling of the domain collection (Exhibits 1, 2, 3, 4), tabulations of inventors (Exhibit 5) and assignees (Exhibit 6), an analysis of the most referenced citations (Exhibits 7, 8), and a break-down of the technology classification CPC group codes (Exhibits 9,10,11).", "All the tables in this report (as available on https://www.moellerventures.com/) are interactive and can be sorted and searched via the column headings and available keyword search boxes with each table.", "- The telemedicine intellectual property profiled in this report represents initiatives of companies that span a variety of technologies such as wireless communications, digital image processing, biometric sensing systems, software, remote diagnostics, and even telemedicine delivery platforms.", "This variety shouldn’t be surprising since telemedicine is a complex combination of all these technologies to deliver healthcare.", "- In general, this landscape tends to focus more on the core technologies (communications, image processing, etc.)", "than the platform delivery technologies. So, there is a larger representation of IP from companies like Qualcomm, Samsung and Sony, than there is from telemedicine platform providers such as Teladoc Health, Doctor on Demand, American Well, or MDLive.", "That said, there is a set of larger diversified technology companies that crossover between core technology and platforms, such as Philips, Medtronic, and GE Health.", "- From a market perspective telemedicine may finally be able to meet growth projections that have eluded the segment for over a decade.", "A combination of more convenient and capable solutions combined with significantly improving reimbursement policies from insurance companies have enabled telemedicine to be positioned as a mainstream healthcare approach.", "- In addition, the very recent challenges with the COVID-19 coronavirus have put a spotlight on the benefits of telehealth in situations where a highly contagious infection poses risks for even showing up at a hospital or clinic.", "- This will be an interesting market to watch over the coming years as competitors, like Amazon and Apple, from outside the classical healthcare markets, provide solutions that intersect with telemedicine.", "- The timeline of patent filings for telemedicine (Exhibit 4) seems to consist of steadily increasing waves of activity, with the most recent surge of patent applications file between Q2 of 2015 and Q4 of 2018.", "The peak of the filing surge is approximately Q2 of 2017.", "- Qualcomm leads the assignees list (Exhibit 6) quite notably with 167 patent applications, 100 more than even the second ranked assignee.", "This exemplifies the extent to which communications and, in particular wireless communications, has become a key element of telemedicine.", "Broadband wired communications, capable of delivering telemedicine, has been available for quite some time from a variety of companies.", "But it’s important to remember that healthcare is a very individualize and personalized service, very similar to how wireless enables personalized communications.", "The emergence of 5G wireless technologies, where Qualcomm has a notable IP position, will also be key to telemedicine.", "5G will enable notably higher data rates that will, in turn, enable additional telemedicine capabilities such as high-quality mobile video communications and remote diagnostics imaging (see Butterfly Network Inc. below).", "Qualcomm’s principle telemedicine platform business, Qualcomm Life Inc. was purchased by private equity firm Francisco Partners of February of 2019 and renamed Capsule Technologies.", "The company competes in the telemedicine market with a cloud-based, end-to-end connectivity platform name 2net Hub.", "- Interestingly the #2 ranked assignee in the landscape is Osterhout Group Inc. Osterhout was an early startup competitor in augmented reality (AR) technology.", "The company filed many patents that noted telemedicine or telehealth applications. Unfortunately, the application of augmented reality to telemedicine seemed to be too much of a stretch for the healthcare market or was at least too much ahead of its appropriate market timing.", "Healthcare is fundamentally a rather conservative adopter of new technology due to the potential life and death consequences.", "Osterhout Group was liquidated in 2018 and the IP was sold to Microsoft and others.", "- Other notable assignees in the top 10 include Philips Electronics (#5), Samsung (#7), and Medtronic (#10).", "- Beyond the top 10 assignees the assignment numbers level off in the 20s and 30s through the top 25 and tend to indicate more focused IP positions.", "For example, Hyperfine Research Inc. (#17 assignee) is a startup company in Connecticut that has developed a portable magnetic resonant imaging machine and an IP position around that technology.", "InTouch Health (#23 assignee) is another notable private company that has focused telemedicine platform technology and is in the process of being acquired by Teladoc Health.", "Butterfly Network (#26 assignee) is another interesting startup that has developed a handheld ultrasound imaging device that connects directly to computers, laptops, tablets, and smartphones.", "- The notable citations of the domain collection are very distributed so even the #1 ranked citations assignee (Micron Technology) only has five patent documents that make the list.", "Micron’s citations consist of lower level technology innovations that pertain mostly to digital imaging processing.", "- #2 on the citations list is First Opinion Corporate, again with only four citations. First Opinion went out of business over a decade ago but had established an IP position in computerized diagnostics and treatment advise technology.", "- The CPC code technology classifications (Exhibit 9) for telemedicine are, as expected, very diverse.", "However, this is a case where the CPC Code Heatmap Timeline (Exhibit 11) shows some interesting trends.", "The heatmap shows the relatively recent surge in patent filings from 2015 through 2018 across the main telemedicine CPC codes of A61B, G06F, and G16H. However, it also shows the emergence of communications (H04L) and wireless communications (H04W) starting mid-2016 and continuing through mid-2019, reflecting the importance of those as enabling technologies to telemedicine.", "The telemedicine market seems to have historically been one of those perpetually emerging segments. Since the dawn of video conferencing people have been predicting that telemedicine would become more popular.", "However, the market generally didn’t fulfill those predictions for a variety of reasons. But that has changed in recent years and the driving forces seem to be a combination of many factors such as technological solutions, improved capabilities, reimbursement allowances, cost efficiencies, market necessity, and even attitude changes on the part of patients and medical staff.", "From a technology perspective telemedicine and the broader connected medicine markets are riding on the Internet-of-Things (IoT) macro application trend, as well as the availability of connected smart devices (e.g. tablets, smartphones, and smart watches).", "This connectivity is enabling broader and more capable options for medical staff to communicate to and interact with patients in ways that are more convenient and cost effective.", "It’s not just a phone call anymore, but rather can include video conferencing to mobile phones and even remote monitoring of patient health and medical attributes via wearable devices.", "This ability for healthcare professionals to stay better connected to patients can, in turn, enable the delivery of proactive preventative heath care that’s more convenient for the patient and cost effective for healthcare providers and insurers.", "Telemedicine and connected medicine can be key factors that change the continually increasing cost trajectory of our healthcare system while improving patient access.", "One other wildcard to the technology portion of telemedicine is the prospect of new competitors from outside of the traditional medtech fields.", "There’s growing focus on companies like Apple and Amazon to potentially enter the telemedicine and connected health markets by leveraging expertise in their respective technology domains into new solutions and new business models for healthcare.", "Telemedicine services have grown rapidly in recent years, particularly with how the services are reimbursed via health insurance plans.", "In the 2019 Kaiser Family Foundation Employer Health Benefits Survey 69% of employer plans covered some type of telemedicine services.", "That’s up from 39% in just three years since the 2016 survey. In addition, the recent challenges of confronting the coronavirus have put a spotlight on how healthcare is delivered and what procedures are in place to deal with a pandemic associated with a highly contagious infection where there are risks in even showing up at a hospital or clinic.", "Finally, most recent industry analysis is estimating the cumulative annual growth rate (CAGR) of the global telemedicine market to be 20% or better over the next five years and potentially be a $130 million to $180 million market opportunity in the 2025-2026 timeframe.", "- 82% of consumers do not use telemedicine, survey says -
