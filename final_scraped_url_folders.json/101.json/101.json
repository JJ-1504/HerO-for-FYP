North Carolina has a long history of constructive energy policy that was developed by finding common ground, which has helped position the state as a leader in clean energy and in economic development.", "Advancing this clean energy transition continues to be a priority for the state and its leaders.

Shifting to Gas Utilities and Infrastructure, results were down $0.03, primarily due to the cancellation of ACP last year.", "In our Commercial Renewables segment, results were down $0.06 for the quarter, driven by lower investments in new renewables projects compared to prior year.", "This is consistent with our guidance in February, and we expect full year 2021 earnings to be within our $200 million to $250 million range.", "Other was unfavorable $0.04 for the quarter, principally due to less favorable market returns on certain benefit plans and higher income tax expense, partially offset by lower financing costs.", "Finally, segment results are impacted by $0.04 of share dilution related to the $2.5 billion equity issuance that closed in December 2020.", "Overall, we had strong results compared to last year, supported by our continued execution and the rebounding economy.", "We remain confident in our ability to consistently grow our adjusted EPS at 5% to 7% throughout the five year period off the 2021 base year.", "Turning to slide eight. Let me provide an overview of electric volumes and economic trends. Our results for the second quarter were up approximately 6.5% year over year.", "Keep in mind, we are comparing sales data to Q2 of last year, which experienced the largest impact from COVID-19.", "Residential volumes were down 6%. However, given stay at home orders during the same period last year, the modest decrease indicates many people continue to work from home on at least a part time basis.", "In fact, this quarter's results are more than 4% above the second quarter of 2019, highlighting the continued strength of the residential class which is supported by customer growth across our service territories.", "As reported on our first quarter earnings call, nearly all large commercial and industrial customers have resumed operations in the sector and the sector is showing signs of optimism.", "The commercial class has rebounded considerably from prior year with an increase of 11.7%. Retail, dining and recreation were all driving the positive year over year comparison as most COVID restrictions have been lifted.", "Similarly, industrial volumes have increased 11.8% for the quarter, whereas volumes had declined 15% last year.", "We expect improvement in the commercial and industrial classes as employment recovers and supply chain bottlenecks are resolved.", "As we progress through the back half of the year, we are monitoring the pace of economic recovery and potential impacts of the delta variant.", "At the same time, we are encouraged by the sales trends so far this year, along with strong customer growth across our service territories.", "With Q2 overall retail volumes returning to Q2 2019 levels, we remain confident in our full year expectation of 1% to 2% load growth for 2021 and are trending toward the top half of that range.", "On slide nine, I'd like to share an update on where we are with our financing plan and dividend growth.", "We remain on track with the financing plan we outlined on the fourth quarter call. The proceeds from the GIC minority interest sale, along with our overall financing plan, allow us to maintain a strong credit profile without the need for common equity issuances throughout our five year plan.", "We are on track to complete the North Carolina storm securitization this fall and we recently issued $3 billion of holding company debt at low attractive rates.", "Finally, we understand the value of our dividend to our investors. This year marks the 95th consecutive year of paying a quarterly cash dividend and the 15th consecutive annual increase.", "Moving to slide 10. I want to provide some perspective on timing considerations for the second half of the year and an update on our cost management efforts.", "We expect volumes will continue to recover over the balance of the year. But as we saw in the second quarter, we expect O&M to be unfavorable in the third quarter when compared to 2020.", "This is due to the actions we took to significantly reduce O&M during the pandemic, such as deferred outages at are generating stations.", "Overall, we reduced O&M $320 million in 2020, equivalent to more than 6% of our non rider recoverable O&M.", "On our February call, we shared that we plan to sustain 65% or $200 million of those savings and carry them forward into 2021.", "We are on track to achieve those savings. This is consistent with our cost management track record since 2016.", "On a consolidated basis, over the past five years, our net regulated electric and gas O&M has declined approximately 1% per year, and we expect this trend to continue.", "Before we open it up for questions, let me close with slide 11. We remain confident in our 2021 adjusted earnings per share guidance of $5 to $5.30 with a midpoint of $5.15.", "Our year to date results position us well to achieve full year results within this range as we continue to invest in important energy infrastructure to benefit our customers and communities.", "Our attractive dividend yield, coupled with our long-term earnings growth profile of 5% to 7%, provide a compelling risk adjusted return for our shareholders.", "As Lynn discussed, we continue to advance our clean energy strategy, adding new renewable generation and taking steps to extend the lives of our carbon free nuclear fleet.", "We continue to engage with state and federal leaders as they work to pave the way for a clean energy future.", "We're executing our capital plan to support those efforts by investing in our energy grid, all while employing financing solutions that save customers money and add value for shareholders.", "Duke Energy is well positioned to lead as the pace of change in our industry accelerates, delivering sustainable value to our customers and investors.", "[Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from Shahriar Pourreza with Guggenham Partners.", "Shahriar Pourreza -- Guggenham Partners -- Analyst", "So appreciate your prepared remarks around House Bill 951, Lynn. Where are we in the process as it stands today?", "Are you still optimistic? I mean, couldn't help but notice some of the lack of bipartisanship going on.", "Lynn J. Good -- Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "Sure. The bill is moving and we are encouraged by what we're seeing. I think you know that it passed the House.", "We've seen support from Senate leadership, the energy legislation remains a priority, and the governor has been clear for some time about his strong commitment to carbon reduction and to renewable investment in the state.", "So we're encouraged that the legislative branch, executive branch and all of the broad stakeholders involved in this process will find common ground.", "And that has been the long history in North Carolina, bringing diverse parties together in advancing energy policy.", "Shahriar Pourreza -- Guggenham Partners -- Analyst", "And just, I want to just elaborate a little bit around sort of the common ground. And I know this isn't obviously a Duke Energy bill and there's a lot of stakeholders involved, but passage of it is going to obviously impact your clean energy transition, right, in the state.", "Investors kind of want to know if there is a possibility of compromise, i.e., between the draft bill versus legislators' versus the governor's very vocal comments, right?", "It's not really your call, but could we see a faster coal retirement outlook, maybe a little less dependency on gas, a bit more solar?", "I mean the governor wants more. So do you see a path forward to kind of maybe bridge this sort of bid ask that's out there?", "Lynn J. Good -- Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "Shahriar, we do. And I think your comments around it's comprehensive, there are many elements to it, you have a broad range of stakeholders, it is natural and expected that there are going to be different points of view in that conversation.", "And what HB 951 does is it outlines a path to a clean energy transition. And the discussion is centering around that pace, the cost, maintaining reliability.", "And we would expect that legislators and the administration will evaluate all portions of this draft bill to find the right balance.", "So I think advancing clean energy transition remains a priority for the state and its leaders as well as its broad range of stakeholders, and we will keep you informed as the bill continues to move.", "We'll take our next question from Julien Dumoulin-Smith with Bank of America.", "Julien Dumoulin-Smith -- Bank of America -- Analyst", "So at risk of asking more on the legislation, perhaps I can pivot a little bit more strategically, if you don't mind.", "And I'd love to hear if you have any latest thoughts with regards to undertaking any further review of the company.", "I know that there's been a lot of, shall we say, noise out there. And would love to hear your latest thoughts there in.", "I'll leave it as open ended as you'd like to comment.", "Lynn J. Good -- Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "Sure. Julien, I assume that's a comment about Elliott Management. And so let me just answer it in that context", "and then we can take it any place you want to go. We regularly engage with our shareholders. We regularly review our portfolio, our operations and business strategy.", "And it has, our approach around engagement has been similar with Elliott. And we have been in discussions with them for over a year, comprehensively reviewing all of the ideas, engaging advisors when we need to, discussing with our Board, all of these ideas.", "And it's not appropriate for me to comment any further on the specifics, but I would confirm to you that we remain open to a constructive engagement, we'll evaluate all proposals, act on those that we believe delivers value to our stakeholders.", "And I would also say that we remain focused on serving of customers, maintaining our assets, advancing the strategic priorities around our clean energy transition, and that remains unchanged as well.", "Julien Dumoulin-Smith -- Bank of America -- Analyst", "Got it. Excellent. Perhaps if I can pivot a little bit differently here as you think about the nonutility side of the business.", "Can you comment at all on just thoughts on scaling that are not. Obviously, it's not been too core of a focus of late, but given some of the pressures across the wider renewable businesses out there, would be curious what you're seeing, if that's impacting any of your time lines and or aspirations in the business.", "Lynn J. Good -- Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "And Julien, we just crossed an important milestone of renewables, so 10,000 megawatts of renewables, which includes both regulated and non regulated investment.", "And we see the growth of renewable energy is important to the clean energy transition. Our commercial team continues to deliver.", "They are forecasting to achieve $200 million to $250 million per year and have been consistent in accomplishing that.", "So it remains an important part of the company. It remains an important part of our commitment around carbon reduction, our ESG story in general.", "And the team is on track to deliver in 2021, 2022 and beyond.", "Julien Dumoulin-Smith -- Bank of America -- Analyst", "Right. Excellent. And just to clarify, do you intend to which you would get this legislation done? I know it's always difficult to say, but any updated thoughts at the end of the forecast period, how that might change as you've refined your planning.", "Might be a little bit early and I know it's transient what could ultimately be included, but I figure, I'd be remiss if I didn't ask.", "Lynn J. Good -- Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "Sure. No. Julien, the plan that we've put in front of you, 2021 to 2025, is not dependent on legislation.", "We have a high degree of confidence in the ability to achieve our 5% to 7% growth rate. But as we talked about in October of last year and we opened the horizon to what the back half of the decade could look like, we do see acceleration of capital, not only in pursuit of retirement of assets and building replacement generation, but also our grid investment as well.", "So we'll continue to update this in the ordinary course, giving you a view in February of what we think 2026 looks like, but we continue to expect acceleration of capital in the back half of the decade.", "We'll now take our next question from Jonathan Arnold with Vertical Research.", "Just on the North Carolina process, in the last quarter when you sort of dissuaded us from being overly concerned about any particular dates, but could you just remind us sort of what the timing in the legislature is through the rest of the year?", "And just anything we should be looking out procedurally? Or is it essentially open ended?", "Lynn J. Good -- Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "Sure. Jonathan, what I would say is that the timing is difficult to predict in these processes. It is within the hands of the legislative leadership.", "And we will know more as the bill progresses through the Senate. There was, in fact, a hearing this morning in the Senate, so we'll continue to keep you updated.", "I think you know that the long session in North Carolina does not have a statutory end date. So we will continue to monitor as it moves through the Senate process.", "Okay. And then just, I know just a comment on feeling that you're trending toward the top half of the sales or load forecast for this year.", "Does that sort of translate into how you feel you're tracking on earnings as well? Or are there other things that are weighing on the other side?", "Lynn J. Good -- Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "Jonathan, we will reset and give you a finer look at where we were trending in the guidance range after third quarter.", "I mean there's just so much weather volatility here in the Southeast. We have hurricane season underway.", "So we will continue to monitor that and give you an update third quarter. But I would say we're off to a strong start.", "Strong start on the economic rebound, strong start on maintaining our focus on O&M, delivering on our key milestones around regulatory approvals, etc.", "So I'm pleased with where we are and also pleased to see the economic recovery. Those strong results in commercial and industrial are indicative of the economy opening up, and I think that's a good thing.", "Great. And just one very quick one. On the annual savings you talked about for the office reconfiguration, were those, is that a pre-tax or after tax number, they're $25 million to $30 million?", "Steven Keith Young -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "We'll take our next question from Steve Fleishman with Wolfe Research.", "So this may have, I think this may have been asked a little bit, but just wanted to better clarify the, as we're watching the IRP and the different scenarios that come out, how should we think about what's embedded in your current capital plan versus what might be incremental?", "Or is it just mainly focused on beyond the current capital plan?", "Lynn J. Good -- Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "So Steve, the capital plan is basically the base of the IRP. And so you should think about it that way.", "The six scenarios, as you move further to the right and you introduce additional technologies in the time frame, that's where the legislation begins to come in, giving us some flexibility to move more rapidly on some of the retirements, etc.", "So when we talk about the implications of how IRP fits with the legislation, we've got a clear line of sight 2021 to 2025 based on present law, based on the present processes, present regulatory processes.", "And the opportunity really exists in the back half of the decade. So that's how I would respond. I don't know, Steve, if you'd add anything to that.", "Steven Keith Young -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Yes. So I think as you move toward a more rapid decarbonization number, then the capital increases, I think within our current five year plan, the upside would be at the back end of things.", "We'll hear next from Durgesh Chopra from Evercore ISI.", "Most of my questions have been answered. Just maybe a big picture, Lynn, sort of what are, sort of what are you and some of the other utility leaders looking at Washington, infrastructure bill sort of is being debated today and then the reconciliation bill going into year end.", "Maybe sort of what are sort of the top two or three things that you see coming out between now and year end, which impacts the sector?", "Lynn J. Good -- Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "Yes, Durgesh, I would say the infrastructure bill will continue to make its path. We're supportive of a bipartisan approach.", "I think as an infrastructure builder, our success over many years has been in a bipartisan framework.", "We're encouraged by the focus on electric vehicles and electric vehicle infrastructure. As you know, that's been a priority for Duke.", "We have about $100 million targeted on that investment and there's certainly potential to expand it. The President today also has been advocating for 40% to 50% of vehicles, electric vehicles by 2030.", "We are also pleased to see investments in zero and low carbon technologies, like advanced nuclear, hydrogen, carbon capture, because we believe those technologies are important for a net zero world.", "So that's what I would say around infrastructure. I think on the remaining, the reconciliation process, tax policy, climate legislation are all being discussed.", "I think it's too early to tell how those shape up. But we are engaged with the administration and with Congress, really talking about the tools that would be helpful for us to pursue our clean energy strategy and see a lot of alignment over time.", "But as you know, in a tight Senate and House, it can be challenging at times to find the right path but we remain engaged.", "Just want to start off here. When thinking about the energy transition kind of from a different perspective, I know Duke has some irons in the fire with regards to RNG investments.", "But do you see any potential to kind of upsize this, increase this over time? Are there policies out there at the federal state level that could be helpful in these efforts?", "Lynn J. Good -- Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "We are getting started, I would say, Jeremy, on RNG. It's consistent with our overall climate targets.", "Certainly, our goals, 100% methane goal, etc., and are working actively to learn more about the technology, learn more about how it impacts our system and have made some very strategic investments.", "And so I do think there's an opportunity for it to develop over time. And the team is working actively with policymakers, with the communities, suppliers that would be relevant to this.", "And I think it will be a bigger story as we move forward.", "Got it. That's helpful. And then could you give any more color, just kind of pivoting here, on what we should be looking for with the IRP filing in Indiana later this year?", "What are some of the considerations versus maybe what we saw coming out of the Carolinas last year?", "Lynn J. Good -- Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "It's a really good question, Jeremy, because we are in the midst of stakeholder engagement in Indiana as well, engagement with the environmental community, with our large customers, certainly the regulators and other policymakers who are relevant to that process.", "The goal is decarbonizing. The goal is diversifying. And if you look at our last IRP that we filed in Indiana, we had about 2,300, 2,400 megawatts of solar starting in 2023, we would expect that to grow.", "And so we've got a couple of more months here in working through the stakeholder process, but we see this as a next step where we, in the rate case, we accelerated retirement dates of coal plants.", "The IRP gives us a chance to expand that discussion on the clean energy transition over the next 20 years.", "And I think it's an important part of the ongoing conversation in Indiana on how the state will position itself for growth in the clean energy transition.", "So more to come on that. And as we look forward to November, third quarter poll, EEI, etc., we'll have more that we can share around Indiana.", "Got it. That's very helpful. Just a real quick last one for me. We very recently seen some utility peers beef up their corporate governance with certain actions.", "I was just wondering if Duke has considered taking actions like this.", "Lynn J. Good -- Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "I think Duke has a strong track record on governance, Jeremy. If you were to look back at the feedback we've received from shareholders and the additional disclosures and adoption of certain practices that we followed, we have been very open minded about these and we'll continue to do so.", "So that becomes a key focus here in the fall as we engage with shareholders, specifically focused on ESG topics.", "Our Corporate Governance Committee is very involved in that. The Board is very involved in some of the conversations with shareholders as well.", "So you can expect us to continue to be responsive to our shareholders in this regard.", "We'll hear next from Michael Lapides with Goldman Sachs.", "Lynn, just curious, how are you all thinking about the commercial power business and what the growth profile of that business looks like over the next couple of years relative to investing in renewables in the regulated business?", "I guess to simplify, what's a better return on capital investing in renewables outside of the regulated utility or within the regulated utility if you could allocate capital only to one of those alternatives?", "Lynn J. Good -- Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "Michael, it's a really good question because we have, we do a lot of work around capital allocation. Of course, what meets the needs of our customers, what fits the policy of our state, what delivers the highest return, those are all key considerations.", "And our Commercial Renewables business has performed well against our benchmarks of what we expect from that business in terms of returns.", "But what you're suggesting is, as we see more opportunity in the regulated business, how will that impact commercial, and I would say that will be very closely reviewed as part of our capital allocation plan going forward.", "I think you also know that we entered a joint venture with John Hancock on the Commercial Renewable business, recycling that capital in the way that it's been quite effective, and those are the types of transactions we will also evaluate over time.", "We like the business in the context of our ongoing ESG story and our pursuit of carbon reduction, but we'll closely scrutinize how capital is allocated.", "Got it. Also, one follow-up. A number of your peers, some of the other large caps, think Exelon or AEP, have made investments in, they're almost like venture capital-like investments in various clean energy related companies, some of which have gone public in the last six to 12 months.", "Just curious, does Duke have similar type of investments and have you ever made any disclosure? And are any of them material or something that would show up in kind of the income statement over time?", "Lynn J. Good -- Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "So Michael, we are active in this area and do make investments. Let me ask Steve to comment. We look at it from a couple of perspectives.", "Certainly, there's an opportunity to earn a return. But as importantly, there's an opportunity to learn about what's going on in various technology developments and various methods of technologies to serve customers, technologies that could advance carbon reduction.", "And as part of our treasury corporate development organization, we are focused on investment in that area in a way that complements our business.", "Steven Keith Young -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Yes. I would add that we have made investments in various venture funds, and we work closely with the fund managers to understand what the investment profile is.", "And as Lynn said, it's aligned with our strategy. It looks at things like EVs and new technologies. And we also ensure that there is communication among our operating folks with the funds and the companies that we invest in, so we can transfer learnings there.", "And we've had some good success there. It's not been material, but we're certainly learning a lot from them.", "We'll take our final question from Anthony Crowdell of Mizuho.", "Lynn, Steve, just, I guess, a quick question. Earlier in the year, Duke had been able to resolve rate case in North Carolina.", "Florida, I think, last year. You resolved Indiana. But just are there any other Duke properties or Duke utilities underearning you're allowed and maybe creating more of a headwind than you thought versus when you went in the year?", "I think you provided some disclosure on the fourth quarter slide deck of maybe adjusted book ROEs going into the year.", "Just, is everyone on target? Or is some of them may be performing better than you thought or less than you thought?", "Steven Keith Young -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Anthony, they're performing well. We do look over time at our allowed returns. And we've got a good history across our footprint of earning at or even above our allowed returns.", "And they'll move around a bit as you're building a rate base for an upcoming rate case. So you'll see some movement around a return based upon some of those profiles.", "But we feel good about our regulatory cadence and our investments around that cadence. And the execution has been good.", "The Indiana case and the Carolinas case are coming through nicely. And we're preparing for the future cases that Lynn was discussing.", "Lynn J. Good -- Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "And Anthony, I would just add that Steve runs a tight process around optimizing capital to make sure it's getting spent at a time that matches with that regulatory calendar.", "So we do all that we know to do to minimize lag. And the result of that is that we have a good track record of earning our return.", "Great. And just a last one for me. You may have touched on it earlier, Lynn, on a question, I think, on maybe some stuff going on in Washington.", "There's talk of maybe a nuclear legislation or some maybe subsidy for nuclear plants. You're talking about license extension on Oconee.", "Just any thoughts to maybe your view on nuclear legislation that may be part of the infrastructure bill.", "Lynn J. Good -- Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "So Anthony, we are strong supporters of nuclear, as you know. And I think, as you look here in the Carolinas, in particular, 50% of the power comes from nuclear across the entire enterprise.", "80% of our carbon free generation is from nuclear. So we are very active. We intend to pursue second license renewal as you indicated.", "And the discussion in Washington has really centered more around the plants that are exposed to markets, commercial markets.", "So think about plants in PJM and otherwise. But we have had discussions with a number of people about the importance of nuclear in the transition, and I do believe it is being recognized by the administration and by Congress.", "And so that's an important area of advocacy for us, not only in existing plants, but on new technologies that would keep nuclear as part of the solution set for the clean energy transition.", "And that does conclude today's question and answer session. I would turn the conference back over to Lynn Good for closing remarks.", "Lynn J. Good -- Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "Well, thank you, Cody, and thanks to all of you who participated today for your interest and investment in Duke Energy.", "And as always, we're available for further discussion, the IR team, Steve and I as well. So thanks again for participating.", "Jack Sullivan -- Vice President of Investor Relations", "Lynn J.

McNeill stated that Exelon was \"clearly on track to meet [its] 2001 earnings target of $4.50 per share.\"", "( Id.) The press release also noted that Exelon's EBIT were $941 million, three-fourth's of which were contributed by Energy Delivery with the balance contributed by Generation, offset by a loss in Enterprises.", "Regarding the performance of Enterprises, the apparent focus of this suit, the press release stated that \"Enterprises' operations were negatively impacted by higher gas prices at Exelon Energy\" but that \"Enterprise companies performed in accordance with their business plans.\"", "( Id.) The release also identified matters discussed therein as forward-looking and contained cautionary information.", "Soon after the issuance of the press release, on May 2, 2001, a credit ratings agency upgraded Exelon's credit rating.", "On May 8, 2001, Exelon issued $500 million in senior unsecured notes; Generation also issued $700 million in senior unsecured notes on June 14, 2001.", "Plaintiffs devote numerous paragraphs in their complaint to detailing \"Enterprises' poor financial results and overvalued investments\" that were allegedly unknown to investors.", "(R. 14, Am.

G, First Quarter 2001 10-Q.) Enterprises recorded negative EBIT of $31 million. The Form 10-Q also contained some cautionary language and incorporated by reference risk factors discussed in other SEC filings.", "Plaintiffs allege that statements discussing first quarter 2001 earnings were false and misleading, allege Plaintiffs, because of declining wholesale energy prices and problems at Enterprises.", "Therefore, Plaintiffs contend that Defendants' statements reaffirming the EPS target of $4.50 per share lacked any reasonable basis.", "In a May 31, 2001 interview to the Wall Street Transcript Corporation, Rowe repeated Exelon's earnings commitment of $4.50 per share and stated that the company believed it had \"a strong capability of meeting [its commitments]\" and that it was working hard \"not only to meet them but to beat them.\"", "(R. 14, Am. Compl. ¶ 69.) Regarding an economic slowdown, Rowe emphasized that all utilities are affected by a slowdown, but that Exelon was less affected than most because of its relatively low-cost generation base; nevertheless, Exelon would keep a \"close weather eye on the economy.\"", "( Id.) Rowe also emphasized that Exelon had a very good first quarter in spite of the shaky economic conditions and that the company was optimistic about having a good year even in an uncertain economy.", "Rowe also represented that Exelon was on track to meet or beat its 2001 EPS target at a June 13, 2001 conference; his statements were included in a press release filed as a Form 8-K. (R. 18-1,", "Defs.' Exs., Vol 1, Ex. M, June 13, 2001 8-K.) Rowe attributed the company's success to better-than-anticipated value-creating opportunities in the first quarter, fueled by high gas prices and Power Team's increasing market savvy.", "When asked about the effects of an excess supply of generation on earnings and profitability, Rowe cited the \"the resilience of an earnings protection afforded by Exelon's low cost nuclear production (less than 2.2 cents/kilowatt-hour), the expertise and market reach of Power Team and the heavy demand generated from ComEd and PECO's combined customer base of 5 million.\"", "( Id.) Rowe continued to describe Generation as Exelon's \"near-term growth vehicle\" and Enterprises as a \"platform for future growth,\" recognizing that a downturn in the telecommunications market was impacting EIS profit margins.", "( Id.) The June 13, 2001 Form 8-K identified some of the matters discussed therein as forward-looking statements that could be affected by the following factors: \"future events affecting the demand for, and the supply of, energy, including weather and economic conditions and the availability of generating units, and economic, business, competitive and regulatory and other factors discussed in Exelon's other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.\"", "Exelon Infrastructure Services (EIS), a segment of Enterprises, provided infrastructure services to energy and telecommunications businesses.", "Rowe's statements during the second quarter were materially false and misleading, Plaintiffs allege, because of a number of factors, including unfavorable weather, declining wholesale energy prices, the economic slump, the decline of the telecommunications market, and Exelon's failure to write down to market value its investment in telecommunications company Corvis.", "3. Statements Announcing Second Quarter 2001 Results", "On July 24, 2001, Exelon issued a press release reaffirming its EPS target; the release also was filed as a Form 8-K with the SEC.", "( Id. at Ex. I, July 24, 2001 8-K.) It listed a strong performance by Power Team as a highlight, while noting that Power Team's success was partially offset by cool weather throughout the nation.", "Individual Defendants each made statements in the release regarding Exelon's performance and ability to meet its commitments.", "McNeill noted that \"[d]espite cool weather and the fall in wholesale prices in June, we've produced earnings that surpassed market expectations.\"", "( Id.) Rowe acknowledged \"larger challenges in the wholesale power markets and in [the] Enterprise group during the second half,\" but opined that the \"combined strength of [the] generation, power marketing and energy delivery groups put [Exelon] in a strong position to meet [its] commitments for the year.\"", "( Id.) Gillis also confirmed Exelon's EPS target, stating, \"We have had two good quarters and we continue to believe our integrated strategy positions us to meet our commitment of $4.50 earnings per share for 2001.\"", "( Id.) Regarding Enterprises, the release noted Enterprises' loss of $5 million in the second quarter; the loss \"reflect[ed] lower margins in the infrastructure services business, which [was] impacted by the significant downturn in the telecommunications industry.\"", "( Id.) The release contained general cautionary language similar to that in prior releases: \"factors that could cause actual results to differ materially include future events affecting the demand for, and the supply of, energy, including weather and economic conditions and the availability of generating units, and other factors discussed in Exelon's filings with the SEC.\"", "That same day Rowe appeared on CNBC's Business Center to discuss Exelon's second quarter results. Rowe noted that Exelon's diversification — in particular its \"fine generation business\" and distribution businesses — gave the company a partial hedge against swings in the market.", "(R. 14, Am. Compl. ¶ 76.) He noted that Exelon received \"support from [its] major sectors\" and expected to continue to work on that in the second half of 2001.", "On August 14, 2001, a few weeks after the July press release, Exelon filed its second quarter 10-Q with the SEC.", "Exelon reported EBIT of $126 million for Generation's second quarter, down from $293 million in the first quarter of 2001.", "Enterprises reported EBIT of negative $36 million, which reflected \"lower margins in the infrastructure business associated with the significant downturn in the telecommunication industry, partially offset by additional margins associated with infrastructure services acquisitions.\"", "(R. 18-1, Defs.' Exs., Vol 1, Ex. J, Second Quarter 10-Q at 38.) Exelon also reported a $31 million decrease in revenues at EIS due to the downturn in the telecommunications industry.", "The 10-Q warned that factors discussed in SEC filings, some incorporated by reference, could affect results.", "Plaintiffs contend that there was no reasonable basis for Defendants' continued assurances in the July 24, 2001 press release and the second quarter Form 10-Q that Exelon would meet its 2001 EPS target.", "In particular, Plaintiffs allege that Exelon was not hedged to withstand the known adverse conditions that negatively impacted Exelon's business and financial results, such as lower demand that left Exelon holding excess capacity purchased at higher prices earlier in 2001, low wholesale energy prices and a decline in telecommunications investments.", "On September 27, 2001, Exelon, citing \"reduced expectations for the third quarter and the recent economic uncertainty,\" issued a press release reducing its 2001 earnings guidance to a range of $4.30 to $4.45.", "( Id., Ex. K, Sept. 27, 2001 8-K.) In particular, Exelon noted that weather-driven reductions in energy-market prices and volatility adversely affected Power Team's performance, Generation's litigation reserves increased by $14 million and severance charges increased to $30 million for the third quarter.", "Exelon also noted that Enterprises had experienced weakness in a number of its businesses in 2001 because of the downturn in the telecommunications market, and specifically mentioned an anticipated $36 million write down of its investment in Corvis and decreasing margins at EIS.", "Following the press release, the price of Exelon's common stock fell to $38.85 on September 27, 2001, from $50.45 on the previous day.", "Exelon subsequently announced its third quarter results in late October 2001, reiterating its revised EPS target of $4.30 to $4.45; a third quarter Form 10-Q followed in mid-November.", "During a mid-October 2001 conference call, Rowe recognized that Enterprises had been \"severely impacted over the past nine months,\" would \"continue to be impacted by the collapse of the telecommunications market\" and that Exelon ceased looking at Enterprises as a strategic growth engine.", "On January 29, 2002, Exelon filed a Form 8-K reporting 2001 earnings per share of $4.43, seven cents (1.5%) lower than Exelon's original target of $4.50.", "Exelon reported that Generation \"came in ahead of budget\" and that Energy Delivery \"exceeded expectations,\" (R. 18-1, Defs.' Exs., Vol 1, Ex.

In fact, Enterprises was expected to report a $15 million loss in 2001; EBIT were projected at $60 million, contributing only 1.7% of Exelon's projected earnings.", "In contrast, Delivery, to which Plaintiffs address few if any particularized allegations, was projected to earn $2,460,000 million, contributing 70% of Exelon's earnings in 2001; Generation was expected to contribute 28% of 2001 earnings.", "Thus, Plaintiffs' detailed allegations regarding the problems at Enterprises do not adequately plead knowledge of falsity because Enterprises was never expected to contribute significantly to earnings in 2001.", "Plaintiffs add allegations of adverse market conditions, economic weakness and declining energy prices to make their case for actual knowledge.", "Nevertheless, Exelon as a whole performed well during the first half of 2001, chipping away at Plaintiffs' argument that Defendants knew the projections would not be met.", "For example, Exelon reported earnings per share of $1.23 in the first quarter of 2001, 27% of the $4.50 projection and within the quarterly distribution of 20-30%.", "(R. 18-1, Defs.' Exs., Vol. 1, Ex. E, Apr. 24, 2001 8-K.) Second quarter earnings, despite the challenges catalogued by Plaintiffs, slightly exceeded the company's projection for that quarter, reported at $.97 per diluted share.", "( Id., Ex. I, July 24, 2001 8-K.) Thus, we cannot infer from these facts that Defendants actually knew that the projection would not be met.", "Third quarter results were disappointing for Exelon due to a constellation of factors that the company warned could affect results, including cooler weather and the accompanying decline in energy prices, which the company disclosed in the September 27, 2001 press release.", "Nevertheless, given the strong performance of the core business of Generation and Delivery throughout 2001 despite these challenges, we conclude that Plaintiffs do not plead facts sufficient to imply actual knowledge of falsity of the projection.", "See In re Hall, Kinion Assocs., Inc., Sees.

Litig., 184 F. Supp.2d 991, 997-98 (N.D.

See also Manavazian v. Atec Group, Inc., 160 F. Supp.2d 468, 484-85 (E.D.N.Y. 2001) (denying motion to dismiss where plaintiffs alleged that defendants knew that the company's core business had materially shrunk and that defendants engaged in unusual insider trading);", "In re Peoplesoft Inc.

See Arazie v. Mullane, 2 F.3d 1456 (7th Cir. 1993).", "As further evidence of scienter, Plaintiffs also claim that Defendants violated GAAP by: (1) recording a $10 million gain on its investments in Corvis during the first quarter of 2001; (2) failing to record an impairment in the value of its investment in Corvis during the first or second quarters of 2001; and (3) failing to record a loss due to an impairment in the carrying value of its reported goodwill during the first half of 2001.", "Defendants argue that these facts do not allege GAAP violations or support a strong inference of scienter.", "We agree that Plaintiffs' GAAP allegations do not support a strong inference of scienter.", "As we noted in Chu II, allegations of GAAP violations, standing alone, are insufficient to raise an inference of scienter.", "Chu II, 100 F. Supp.2d at 838. Rather, a plaintiff must also plead facts that support an inference that a defendant acted with reckless disregard or gross indifference to alleged misrepresentations in financial statements.", "Id. Facts that might support such an inference include those detailing the magnitude of the accounting error, a defendant's prior notice of the error or a defendant's responsibility for calculating and disseminating financial information.", "Two of Plaintiffs' alleged GAAP violations relate to Exelon's reporting on its investment in Corvis. Exelon, Plaintiffs argue, should not have recorded a $10 million gain in Corvis during the first quarter of 2001 and should have recorded an impairment in the value of Corvis during the first or second quarters of 2001 rather than the third quarter.", "With respect to the first quarter $10 million gain, the parties dispute whether Exelon properly recorded the gain.", "Plaintiffs assert that the Corvis shares were transferred among entities under common control and thus should not have been revalued; Defendants maintain that the shares were distributed from an investment limited partnership under the cost method of accounting, which allowed Exelon to revalue the shares to the extent their current value exceeded their cost.", "Plaintiffs' allegations regarding the gain, however, do not necessitate that we delve into the maze of GAAP.", "Assuming arguendo that the decision to record the $10 million gain was a violation of GAAP, this fact does not support a strong inference scienter.", "Plaintiffs must allege that Defendants made this error with reckless disregard or gross difference, which in this case is not shown by the relatively insignificant error.", "Id. Plaintiffs allege that the gain inflated Exelon's net income for the first quarter; net income was reported at $399, inflated by the Corvis gain by less than 3%, which does not raise a strong inference of scienter.", "See Greebel v. FTP Software, Inc., 194 F.3d 185, 206 (1st Cir. 1999) (concluding that improperly recorded revenue that raised overall revenue by up to 4% did not support a strong inference of scienter); In re Allscripts, Inc. Secs.", "Litig., No. 00 C 6796, 2001 WL 743411, at *10-11 (N.D.Ill. June 29, 2001) (same). Cf. Chalverus v. Pegasystems, Inc., 59 F. Supp.2d 226, 228-29 (Mass. 1999) (denying motion to dismiss where GAAP violation alleged improper reporting of $5 million in software license revenue where overall software license revenue was $9 million).", "Plaintiffs' allegation that Exelon failed to timely record an impairment in the value of Corvis also does not support an inference of scienter.", "Although Exelon wrote down the investment in the third quarter of 2001, Plaintiffs contend that the impairment should have been recorded in the first or second quarter of 2001.", "The impairment, Plaintiffs argue, should have been recognizable to Exelon as \"other-than-temporary\" under GAAP during the first half of 2001.", "The fact remains, however, that Defendants did write down the investment in Corvis in the third quarter and thus the parties only dispute when the write down should have occurred.", "In an analogous context, the Seventh Circuit held that this type of timing dispute does not adequately plead fraud.", "See DiLeo v. Ernst Young, 901 F.2d 624, 626 (7th Cir. 1990). In DiLeo, plaintiffs alleged that defendant accounting company certified fraudulent financial statements that understated losses from bad loans by about $4 billion.", "In affirming the dismissal of the complaint for failure to plead fraud with particularity, the Seventh Circuit noted that \"[i]f all that is involved is a dispute about the timing of the writeoff, based on estimates of the probability that a particular debtor will pay, we do not have fraud; we may not even have negligence.\"", "Id. Here, the probability was not whether a debtor would pay but rather whether the value of Corvis shares would increase.", "Despite the falling price of Corvis shares during the first half of 2001, Defendants did not write down their investment in Corvis during the first two quarters, holding out for a rebound in the share price.", "Perhaps the delay in reporting the write down was overly-optimistic, but as noted in DiLeo, for every write-down, there is always someone who says the company should have acted sooner.", "In this case, Plaintiffs only assert that the company should have reported the impairment three to six months before it actually did so.", "Furthermore, as noted by Defendants, even if Exelon had not recorded the $10 million gain and had recorded the $36 million charge, EPS would still have been in the projected target range for the first two quarters of 2001.", "(R. 20, Defs.' Reply at 18 n. 24.) Plaintiffs' GAAP violations allege relatively modest amounts of improperly recorded gains and losses when compared to the hundreds of millions of dollars the company was earning each quarter.", "In short, the allegations involving Corvis do not raise a strong inference of scienter, as required by the PSLRA.", "Finally, Plaintiffs' allegations that Exelon failed to timely record impaired goodwill in the amount of $243 million also fail because they are not plead with particularity and do not give rise to a strong inference of scienter.", "Plaintiffs allege that the value of Enterprises was impaired as early as June 30, 2001 due to Enterprises' investment in the declining telecommunications industry, including Corvis, but that Exelon waited until March 31, 2002 to report the charge.", "The allegations, however, largely lack detail as to which businesses or assets were impaired and by how much and why the write down was necessary after the first half of 2001, all necessary elements of pleading fraud with particularity.", "Rather, the allegations strike the Court as ones of fraud by hindsight; Plaintiffs do not allege any specifics on the amount of write-downs that should have been taken in 2001, but point to the $243 million charge in the first quarter of 2002 and argue that it should have been taken sooner, without allegations to support this contention.", "Such generalized allegations cannot raise an inference of scienter. Cf. In re Revlon Sees. Litig., No. 99 Civ 10192, 2001 WL 293820, *1 (S.D.N.Y. Mar. 27, 2001) (denying in part motion to dismiss securities fraud action where plaintiffs plead particularized allegations that defendant falsified financial results through the recognition of \"revenue\" from false sales and the failure to timely write down excess and obsolete inventory and alleged that overstatements of net income were between 22% and 655%).", "In short, Plaintiffs' GAAP allegations lack particularity and do not give rise to a strong inference of scienter.", "In addition, because Plaintiffs fail to plead a primary cause of action under § 10 and Rule 10b-5, Plaintiffs' § 20(a) claims against the individual Defendants as controlling persons also fail.", "See Geinko v. Padda, No. 00 C 5070,2001 WL 1163728, at *9 (N.D. Ill. Sept. 28, 2001).", "In this era of focused attention on issues of corporate fraud and responsibility, the Court has very carefully reviewed Plaintiffs' complaint.", "Nonetheless, the complaint fails on various grounds. Defendants' earnings projections were accompanied by sufficient cautionary language such that the statements fall under the first prong of the PSLRA's safe harbor.", "In addition, Plaintiffs fail to plead facts that give rise to a strong inference of scienter as required by the PSLRA — actual knowledge with respect to the forward-looking statements and recklessness with respect to the remaining statements.", "The Court recognizes that leave to amend should be granted freely, but in this case, any amendment to the instant complaint would be futile.", "The extensive cautionary language bars any claims based on the projections, and the GAAP violations are essentially timing issues, which the Seventh Circuit suggests cannot constitute fraud.", "DiLeo, 901 F.2d at 626. As such, the Court grants Defendants' motion to dismiss with prejudice.", "(R. 17-1.)

Redefine Energy and Utility Sectors’ Decarbonization Efforts", "SAN FRANCISCO, Nov. 4, 2021 /PRNewswire/ — Kevala Inc., a nationwide leader in energy data and grid analytics, today announced the release of groundbreaking new carbon accounting research conducted in coordination with leading energy and utility providers National Grid (NYSE: NGG) and Exelon Corporation (Nasdaq: EXC).", "The participating companies’ joint White Paper, “Total Carbon Accounting: A Framework to Deliver Localized Carbon Intensity Data,” explores advanced analytic methods designed to better compute the carbon intensity of grid electricity with higher degrees of geographic and temporal granularity, ensuring the energy sector is best equipped to evaluate, prioritize, and measure decarbonization activities in the future.", "“Capable of closely identifying where and when generated power is consumed, the ‘Total Carbon Accounting’ approach detailed in our research provides a unique basis for assessing all carbon emissions associated with electricity flowing throughout homes and businesses,” said Aram Shumavon, Founder and Chief Executive Officer of Kevala.", "“Our innovative framework for carbon accounting will fundamentally redefine how governments, regulators, corporations, and individuals invest in and achieve emissions reductions across the grid.", "We are delighted to share the work of our consortium on this important topic.”", "Dr. Bob Currie, Vice President of Products and Strategy at Kevala, said, “Kevala exists to accelerate decarbonization, to do this we need to innovate and collaborate.", "Our platform and products are focused on expanding the granular understanding of locational and temporal variations in energy, making more accurate and specific carbon intensity data a natural next step.”", "The Total Carbon Accounting (TCA) method requires complex, simultaneous analyses of both (1) the physical flows of power across all individual nodes on the grid within a given point in time, and (2) the carbon associated with all generation sources – including those embedded in the distribution system and customer premises – as well as the larger transmission-connected units that participate in the market.", "In leveraging TCA’s comprehensive methodology, key energy stakeholders can more accurately drive the matching of carbon-free power supplies to load forecasts.", "“By utilizing extraordinarily granular datasets and new tools to trace power generation throughout the grid, industry reporting around emission reduction efforts will improve exponentially,” said Duncan Burt, Chief Sustainability Officer of National Grid, “this data will create new insights that will help our communities understand the energy they use and ensure we can properly measure how we are achieving the goal of a lower carbon grid.”", "Current methods for carbon accounting utilize gross averaging across wide geographical areas and timeframes, thereby overlooking the temporal aspect of clean power generation, as well as the effects of closely connected renewable generation at the distribution level.", "By focusing on discrete analyses of all components in the balance of power supply and consumption constraints on the grid, TCA serves as a long-term foundation for enhancing carbon awareness in the United States and around the world.", "TCA is now being tested in pilot deployments by major utilities in both North America and Europe.", "“With revolutionary advances in grid analytics, this approach changes the paradigm in terms of how carbon removal can be measured and understood for delivered power,” said Sunny Elebua, Vice President of Strategy and Chief Sustainability Officer at Exelon.", "“We are excited to pilot this new capability and understand the opportunities it can create for energy generators and consumers, grid operators, and local communities along the path to power sector decarbonization.”", "Kevala’s partnership with National Grid and Exelon Corporation on this White Paper and technology further demonstrates the growth and momentum of the company’s Assessor platform, signaling an increasing drive for improved data assessment around the ‘electrification of everything.’", "The TCA White Paper release follows several recent, high-profile corporate announcements from Kevala, including the closing of its $21 million Series A funding round and the expansion of its Advisory and Professional Services department.", "To view Kevala, National Grid, and Exelon Corporation’s “Total Carbon Accounting: A

Exelon also warned that because Generation uses contracts for the forward sale and purchase of energy, increased operating costs and depressed prices in the wholesale market would adversely affect Generation's operation.", "Generation's participation in volatile spot markets, Exelon cautioned, also involved credit risks that Generation might not be able to manage or hedge.", "With respect to Enterprises, Exelon warned that EIS and Exelon Services were dependent on the continued growth of the communications, cable and internet industries and that Enterprises' investments were weighted toward the communications industry.", "The sale, write down, or write off of investments, Exelon disclosed, might increase the volatility of earnings.", "In short, the \"Outlook\" section on the March 16, 2001 Form 8-K, released the month before the first allegedly false statement, contained detailed language that cautioned investors as to factors that could negatively impact Exelon's financial results.", "Although a company need not list all factors that might affect results, Exelon's disclosure nevertheless was exhaustive.", "In addition to the cautionary language contained in the March 14, 2001 Form 8-K and incorporated by reference, each statement also contained additional language warning investors of risks that could affect earnings results.", "First, in the April 24, 2001 press release reaffirming the earnings target, also filed as a Form 8-K and clearly identified as a forward-looking statement, Exelon warned of factors that could affect actual results, including \"future events affecting the demand for, and the supply of, energy, including weather and economic conditions and the availability of generating units, and other factors discussed in Exelon's filings with the SEC.\"", "(R. 18-1, Defs.' Exs., Vol. 1, Ex. E, Apr. 24, 2001 8-K.) Plaintiffs' claims involving declining energy prices and falling rates stem from the very supply and demand issues flagged in the albeit generic language of the April 24, 2001 press release.", "That language, however, together with the detailed disclosure in the March 14, 2001 Form 8-K, sufficiently warned investors of risks that might affect Exelon's business such that the safe harbor of 15 U.S.C. § 78u-5(c)(1)(A)(i) protects the April 24, 2001 statement.", "Plaintiffs also claim that in the first quarter Form 10-Q Defendants failed to disclose and misrepresented risks that made the earnings projection unattainable.", "( See R. 14, Am. Compl. ¶¶ 67-68.) The Form 10-Q, however, also contained sufficient cautionary language.", "It flagged the market risks related to changes in commodity prices and interest rates and explained Exelon's use of derivative instruments to manage the risks along with the dangers related to using derivative instruments.", "(R. 18-1, Defs.' Exs., Vol. 1, Ex. G, First Quarter 10-Q at 44-45.) While the language also noted steps taken to minimize risk, the language nevertheless identified the risks to a reasonable investor.", "Further cautioning investors, the Form 10-Q also incorporated by reference risk factors discussed in other filings with the SEC, which includes the long list of factors detailed in the March 14, 2001 Form 8-K. ( Id. at 2.)", "Therefore, Defendants' reaffirmation of Exelon's earnings projection in the first quarter Form 10-Q falls within the first prong of the PSLRA's safe harbor.", "Similarly, Rowe's statement in the May 31, 2001 Wall Street interview contained cautionary language by reference.", "The statement noted that the interview included forwardlooking statements and that risk factors are often included in the company's SEC filings.", "(R. 18-1, Defs.' Exs., Vol. 1, Ex. N, WST Interview at 1.) In addition, Rowe conceded that all utilities companies are affected by an economic slowdown, but that Exelon monitored economic conditions closely and was less affected by a slowdown because of its low-cost generation base.", "Together, Rowe's qualified warning along with the warnings in the March 14, 2001 Form 8-K were sufficient to advise a reasonable investor of risks that might affect results.", "Next, Plaintiffs challenge the statements by Rowe in a June 13, 2001 conference, repeated in a press release filed as a Form 8-K, that Exelon was on track to meet or beat its EPS target.", "The June 13, 2001 Form 8-K identified statements in the press release and presentation made by Rowe at the conference as forwardlooking statements and cautioned in language very similar to that in the April 24, 2001 Form 8-K: \"The following factors, among others, could cause actual results to differ materially, and include future events affecting the demand for, and the supply of, energy, including weather and economic conditions and the availability of generating units.\"", "( Id., Ex. M, June 13, 2001 Form 8-K.) The Form also referred to factors discussed in the company's other SEC filings.", "Again, the language in the statement, although bordering on generic, was more than a general warning regarding poor economic conditions, but contained warnings of factors that could significantly affect Exelon's earnings.", "See In re Champion Enters., 144 F. Supp.2d at 859. Together with the detailed cautionary language in the March 14, 2001 filing, the language was sufficiently cautionary to invoke the statutory safe harbor.", "Similar cautionary language and reference to other SEC filings in the July 24, 2001 Form 8-K and press release also shields Defendants' EPS-related forwardlooking statements in those documents.", "( Id., Ex. I. July 25, 2001 8-K.) In addition, the release flagged several factors that might affect earnings, including \"challenges in the wholesale power markets and in our Enterprise group,\" specifically noting \"lower margins in the infrastructure services business [during the second quarter], which has been impacted by the significant downturn in the telecommunications industry.\"", "( Id. at 2-3.) This cautionary language picked up on warnings in the March 14, 2001 Form 8-K and provided investors with detailed information as to the factors that might affect Exelon's business.", "Finally, Plaintiffs challenge Defendants' assurances in the August 14, 2001 Form 10-Q that Exelon would meet its 2001 EPS target.", "The Form contained a paragraph identifying statements in the filing as forward-looking and warned that factors including \"those discussed herein as well as those listed in Note 7 of Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, those discussed in \"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation-Outlook\" in Exelon Corporation's 2000 Annual Report, and other factors discussed in filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission could affect results.\"", "( Id., Ex. J, Second Quarter 10-Q.) In this case, Exelon's March 14, 2001 Form 8-K, incorporated by reference, provided language that sufficiently warned investors of risks.", "See supra discussion of March 14, 2001 Form 8-K. In addition, the second quarter Form 10-Q contained the same cautionary language relating to market risks and the use of derivative instruments that we found meaningful in the first quarter Form 10-Q. Furthermore, the Form 10-Q specifically refers to factors in Note 7 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements that could affect earnings.", "Note 7 includes disclosures regarding environmental liabilities because of site contamination ($168 million accrued as of the end of the second quarter with other costs unknown), Exelon's energy commitments and various suits pending against Exelon, ComEd and PECO.", "( Id. at 23-26.) In short, the second quarter Form 10-Q disclosed multiple risks that could affect Exelon's earnings such that application of the PSLRA's safe harbor is appropriate.", "Plaintiffs also challenge Rowe's statement to Crain's Chicago Business, published on August 27, 2001 that Enterprises' EBIT would be zero to negative.", "Plaintiffs contend that Rowe had no reasonable basis to represent that Enterprises might achieve \"zero\" EBIT in 2001 because EBIT in the first half of 2001 were negative $36 million.", "Rowe, however, stated a range of possible EBIT in a gloomy article, entitled \"Exelon halts campaign to diversity; won't expand, may sell unregulated businesses,\" that revealed that Exelon would invest little or nothing in Enterprises in 2002.", "The projection was clearly negative and simply because Rowe offered a range of projected EBIT does not make the statement misleading.", "To label the statement as fraudulent is simply a stretch.", "ii. 15 U.S.C. § 78u-5(c)(1)(B): Actual Knowledge of Misleading or False Nature", "Even assuming arguendo that the alleged fraudulent statements were not accompanied by meaningful cautionary language, Plaintiffs' EPS-related claims nevertheless fail because Plaintiffs do not plead facts that show a strong inference that Defendants actually knew that their EPS-related forward-looking statements were false or misleading.", "Although allegations of recklessness plead with particularity survive a motion to dismiss in the case of statements of present or historical fact, the PSLRA provides a safe harbor for forward-looking statements if a plaintiff fails to plead with particularity that a defendant made the statement with actual knowledge that it was false or misleading.", "See 15 U.S.C. § 78u-5(c)(1)(B); 15 U.S.C. § 78u-4(b)(2); Helwig, 251 F.3d at 551. Thus, to survive the motion to dismiss their forward-looking EPS-related claims, Plaintiffs must plead with particularity facts that strongly imply that Defendants actually knew that the projections were false or misleading when they made them.", "Although there is great debate among the Circuit Courts as to what types of factsthose showing motive and opportunity to commit fraud and/or those establishing strong circumstantial evidence of conscious behavior or recklessness — adequately plead scienter, this Court has previously held and repeats that the type of facts plead is immaterial so long as they support a strong inference that the defendant acted knowingly.", "Chu v.

However, rather than dismissing Plaintiffs' allegations outright for failure to plead the appropriate standard, the Court will examine the evidence of motive and opportunity and circumstantial evidence Plaintiffs offer to plead scienter.", "First, Plaintiffs' allegations of motive and opportunity are not of the type that give rise to a strong inference of actual knowledge of falsity.", "Plaintiffs allege that because of their high-level positions Rowe, McNeill and Gillis had the opportunity to commit fraud and were motivated so that Exelon and Generation's debt offerings might be consummated on better terms and their compensation packages increased.", "As we have previously concluded, maximizing both earning potential on corporate debt offerings and executive compensation are \"the goals of all corporate executives; as such, they do not even remotely suggest fraudulent motivation.\"", "Chu v.

Therefore, Plaintiffs' allegations of motive and opportunity do not give rise to a strong inference of scienter.", "Plaintiffs, however, contend that the bulk of their scienter allegations fall into the second category of strong circumstantial evidence of scienter.", "Plaintiffs maintain that they adequately plead circumstantial evidence with their allegations that Defendants failed to disclose that \"adverse market conditions, economic weakness, declining energy prices and undisclosed company specific information evidencing the collapse of Exelon's Enterprises business segment\" made the $4.50 EPS target unattainable.", "(R. 27, Pls.' Mem. at 18-21.) Defendants, in turn, maintain that Plaintiffs fail to allege with particularity facts that indicate that Defendants knew the projections would not be met.", "Plaintiffs, they argue, essentially plead fraud by hindsight.", "We agree that Plaintiffs' allegations that Defendants knew the projections would not be met are conclusory and insufficient to plead actual knowledge.", "Plaintiffs essentially assert that Defendants must have known that the EPS target would not be met because of challenges at Enterprises due to the decline of the telecommunications industry and because of the negative effects of cool weather and lower energy prices on Generation, which held long-term power contracts.", "A large portion of Plaintiffs' allegations describe challenges faced by Enterprises, labeled as a long-term money earner from the time of the merger.", "It was never expected, however, that Enterprises would contribute significantly to earnings in 2001. In fact, Enterprises was expected to report a $15 million loss in 2001; EBIT were projected at $60 million, contributing only 1.7% of Exelon's projected earnings.", "in contrast, Delivery, to which Plaintiffs address few if any particularized allegations, was projected to earn $2,460,000 million, contributing 70% of Exelon's earnings in 2001; Generation was expected to contribute 28% of 2001 earnings.", "Thus, Plaintiffs' detailed allegations regarding the problems at Enterprises do not adequately plead knowledge of falsity because Enterprises was never expected to contribute significantly to earnings in 2001.", "Plaintiffs add allegations of adverse market conditions, economic weakness and declining energy prices to make their case for actual knowledge.", "Nevertheless, Exelon as a whole performed well during the first half of 2001, chipping away at Plaintiffs' argument that Defendants knew the projections would not be met.", "For example, Exelon reported earnings per share of $1.23 in the first quarter of 2001, 27% of the $4.50 projection and within the quarterly distribution of 20-30%.", "(R. 18-1, Defs.' Exs., Vol. 1, Ex. E, Apr. 24, 2001 8-K.)

Thus, we cannot infer from these facts that Defendants actually knew that the projection would not be met.", "Third quarter results were disappointing for Exelon due to a constellation of factors that the company warned could affect results, including cooler weather and the accompanying decline in energy prices, which the company disclosed in the September 27, 2001 press release.", "Nevertheless, given the strong performance of the core business of Generation and Delivery throughout 2001 despite these challenges, we conclude that Plaintiffs do not plead facts sufficient to imply actual knowledge of falsity of the projection.", "See In re Hall, Kinion Assocs., Inc., Secs.

Moreover, as the guaranteed prices of PURPA contracts signed in the 1980s expire, many renewable power generators are going out of business.", "The bottom line is that as long as fossil fuel price forecasts are low, there will be very little development of new renewable energy.", "What is needed is a new law that accounts for the full range of benefits of renewable energy, like reduced pollution, less global warming, domestic and local economic development, and reduced dependence on foreign energy sources.", "Such a law must be part of electric industry restructuring legislation. The renewables portfolio standard can move large amounts of clean energy into the mainstream; the system benefits fund can support new and emerging energy sources; and closing loopholes in the Clean Air Act for old coal plants will reduce the unfair advantage those gross polluters enjoy.", "In short, PURPA can only be replaced with a better law, not with no law.

To reach our shared regional economic and development goals and climate goals, current and future supply chains need clean, reliable, and affordable energy.", "Specifically, the United States is challenging a 2021 amendment to Mexico’s Electric Power Industry Law that prioritizes CFE-produced electricity over electricity generated by all private competitors; Mexico’s inaction, delays, denials, and revocations of private companies’ abilities to operate in Mexico’s energy sector; a December 2019 regulation granting only PEMEX an extension to comply with the maximum sulfur content requirements under Mexico’s applicable automotive diesel fuel standard; and a June 2022 action that advantages PEMEX, CFE, and their products in the use of Mexico’s natural gas transportation network.", "These measures appear to be inconsistent with several of Mexico’s USMCA obligations, including under the Market Access, Investment, and State-Owned Enterprises chapters.", "In 2013, Mexico pursued various energy reforms, in response to which U.S. companies invested in Mexico’s energy sector.", "Specifically, U.S. companies have: (1) established and operated wind and solar energy farms and cogeneration and combined cycle facilities in Mexico that would contribute electricity to Mexico’s grid; (2) strengthened interconnection contracts that bring U.S. electricity to Mexico across the border through wires; and (3) imported U.S.-origin fuels to Mexico for sale at gas stations.", "Since December 2018, however, Mexico has pursued an energy policy centered on reinstating the primacy of its state-owned electrical utility, CFE, and oil and gas company, PEMEX.", "Mexico has undertaken various measures to achieve this aim. For example, in March 2021, Mexico amended its Electric Power Industry Law so that its grid operator will prioritize for dispatch to Mexico’s grid CFE-generated electricity over electricity generated by all private competitors, irrespective of cost or environmental impact.", "Mexico has also taken, or is taking, actions or inactions, which are curtailing the ability of private companies to participate effectively, if at all, in Mexico’s energy sector.", "These actions include, but are not limited to, delaying, denying or failing to act on applications for new permits or permit modifications; suspending or revoking existing permits; or otherwise blocking private companies’ ability to operate renewable energy facilities, such as wind and solar installations, to import and export electricity and fuel, to store or transload fuel, and to build or operate retail fuel stations.", "In addition, in December 2019, Mexico’s energy regulator granted PEMEX – but not other companies, including U.S. companies – a five-year extension to comply with maximum sulfur content requirements under its fuel standard in certain parts of Mexico, which otherwise require the sale of ultra-low sulfur diesel fuel throughout the country.", "Without the extension, PEMEX would have to purchase ultra-low sulfur diesel imported from the United States and/or upgrade its facilities to produce ultra-low sulfur diesel in sufficient quantities.", "More recently, in June 2022, Mexico’s Secretary of Energy notified the Energy Regulatory Commission (CRE) and the National Natural Gas System Operator (CENAGAS) of a change in policy that would require, among other things, that users of Mexico’s gas transportation network demonstrate that they source natural gas from PEMEX or CFE.", "The United States has raised concerns with Mexico regarding its energy policies on numerous occasions, including in connection with the USMCA Free Trade Commission meetings in 2021 and 2022, the Deputies Meeting of the USMCA Free Trade Commission in 2022, and in meetings of the USMCA Committee on State-Owned Enterprises and Designated Monopolies.", "Ambassador Tai also consulted members of Congress and a broad range of stakeholders to hear their serious concerns with the deteriorating trajectory of Mexico’s energy policies.", "Under USMCA Article 31.4.5, the parties shall enter into consultations within 30 days of the U.S. request, unless the parties decide otherwise.", "Under USMCA Article 31.6.1, if the parties do not resolve the matter through consultations within 75 days of the U.S. request, the United States may request the establishment of a panel.", "A copy of the consultations request can be found here."]}

Details of the bankruptcy are complex and not the subject of this testimony, and certain aspects of the California ecosystem and regulatory framework are unique.", "However, the California wildfires and resulting bankruptcy of one of the nation’s leading utilities are important as a case study for how we will manage these complex issues going forward and appropriately allocate the inevitable, enormous, and increasing costs of climate change threats and damage to our nation’s critical infrastructure among numerous stakeholders, including ratepayers, investors, and federal and state taxpayers.", "In August 2019, Columbia University’s Center on Global Energy Policy published a research paper titled “PG&E: Market and Policy Perspectives on the First Climate Change Bankruptcy.", "”[3] In that paper, my co-authors Sarah La Monaca and James Kobus (who are here with me today) and I sought to trace the factors that led to the bankruptcy, assess wildfire and climate risk broadly across the US power and utility sector, examine financial market and policy responses to the bankruptcy, and provide recommendations for policymakers and other stakeholders.", "As discussed in our paper, while dynamics specific to PG&E and California’s liability framework were factors, climate change played a material role in the wildfires and PG&E’s subsequent bankruptcy.", "This is because climate change has created conditions in California and elsewhere that make fires more intense, more damaging, and more likely to occur.", "Researchers at Columbia University, the University of Idaho, and the University of California, Los Angeles have found that climate change has already diminished autumn rains, increased winds in the western US, and driven an increase in daily maximum temperatures of more than three degrees Fahrenheit, measured relative to the late 1800s.[4]This has led to tinderbox conditions as brush and vegetation become drier and more prone to burning.", "Putting these trends together, another study estimates that climate change has caused an extra 4.2 million hectares of wildfire damage in the western United States since the 1980s—nearly double the number of acres burned than would otherwise have been expected.[5]", "Climate Change is Going to Make Wildfires Worse – and Not Just in California", "Although the magnitude of the forecasts varies, the scientific literature almost universally projects significant climate-change-driven increases in wildfire activity and intensity across the United States by the end of the century.[6] The United States government’s Fourth National Climate Assessment, released in November 2018, notes that “by the middle of this century, the annual area burned in the western United States could increase from two to six times from the present, depending on the geographic area, ecosystem, and local climate.”[7]", "Importantly, while current wildfire activity in California is of national concern given its population, the size of its economy, and its climate leadership, the largest increases in wildfire activity are expected in other states.", "The map below, taken from a 2015 study in the International Journal of Wildland Fire, shows how different regions across the US are likely to be affected.[8]", "As is painfully evident in the map, many regions are likely to face growing danger, notably the Southeast and Northwest parts of the country.[9]", "Figure 1: Projected increase in “very large fire weeks” by midcentury (2041-2070) compared to 1971-2000.", "The Role of the Power Sector in Wildfire Risk and Prevention", "As the California situation has shown, the power sector can be expected to both cause wildfires and be susceptible to them.", "Although a wide variety of factors contribute to wildfire ignitions, electrical equipment has been a leading proximate cause of some of the most damaging wildfires in California, including the 2018 Camp Fire in California.[10] This can occur when distribution or transmission lines fail in high wind or other harsh weather conditions, igniting nearby vegetation and sparking rapidly spreading wildfires.", "However, wildfires can also be damaging to electric utility companies by causing physical damage to energy infrastructure, disrupting power service, and even leading to severe financial distress.", "First, wildfires cause direct physical damage to utility infrastructure such as power lines and substations.", "But the risk to energy infrastructure from climate change is broader. A 2019 paper from BlackRock Investments details climate risks to the utility sector, noting that as a result of climate change, storm surge, high winds, and flooding from hurricanes pose increased risks to several categories of utility assets, including power plants and transmission and distribution networks.[11]", "The United States Department of Energy estimates that sea level rise is likely to cause storm-surge exposure increases of 12 to 40 percent for power plant assets and 18 to 44 percent for substations.[12]", "Second, wildfires pose a threat to reliable electricity service. While the fires themselves can disrupt electricity service in the affected areas, a new and emerging trend has further underscored the problem: preventative power shutoffs.", "One of the tools California is now using to combat wildfire ignitions is its Public Safety Power Shutoff (PSPS) program, in which the state’s utility companies preemptively shut off electricity service when high-risk weather conditions suggest a heightened possibility of electrical equipment wildfire ignition.", "In an effort to reduce wildfire risk, utility companies have recently implemented these preventative blackouts, cutting power to millions of customers on several occasions in the fall of 2019.", "While it’s not the focus of my testimony today, these preventative steps can have severe impacts on health and safety, as well as economic repercussions.", "These events highlight the escalating costs of providing reliable electricity service in a country that is rapidly becoming more vulnerable to the negative effects of climate change.", "If customers are going to continue to demand the near 100 percent reliability of electricity service that they are accustomed to, large infrastructure investment will be required to reduce the damage caused by wildfires, sea level rise, and other climate-related events, and to make the electric grid and related assets more intelligent and more resilient.", "Third, wildfires present a unique financial threat to US power and utility companies because they are the one type of climate-related disaster that such companies may be shown to have directly caused.", "In most states (with California as a notable exception), if a utility company is found to have operated its system prudently, any resulting property damage and other costs are typically borne by private insurance companies and property owners rather than the utility itself.", "If a utility is found to have operated its system imprudently, however, the company could be held liable for such damages, which are likely to be in the billions of dollars.", "Damages of this magnitude can bankrupt a utility company, as we’ve seen with PG&E. In either case, climate-change-driven wildfire activity will increase costs to utility-sector stakeholders, including investor-owned utilities, state and local governments, ratepayers, and taxpayers.", "These increased costs will in turn place financial stress on utility companies and crowd out essential investment in renewable energy and grid upgrades.", "Other States Can Learn from California’s Policy Response", "In July 2019, California Governor Gavin Newsom signed into law a wildfire insurance package that is the first in the nation to address major utility financial risk resulting from increasing climate risk.", "The bill created a $21 billion insurance fund, capitalized through ratepayer contributions of $10.5 billion and another $10.5 billion shared proportionally among California’s investor owned utilities.", "Separately, the legislation established a Wildfire Safety Advisory Board, staffed by industry and academic experts, to advise the California Public Utility Commission and to review utilities’ implementation of specific safety requirements, including having an approved fire mitigation plan, establishing a fire safety committee, and tying executive compensation to safety culture.", "Overall, California’s policy response provides important lessons for designing comprehensive frameworks for allocating the costs from climate change across investors, ratepayers, and taxpayers.", "The legislative response, while not without its drawbacks, created a regulatory structure that is designed to balance accountability and increased oversight with maintaining the financial health of the state’s utilities.", "Ultimately, utility companies are central actors in making crucial grid upgrades and renewable energy investments over the coming years, and it is in no one’s best interest for investor-owned utilities to file for bankruptcy every few years.", "At the same time, utility companies need to be held accountable for their wildfire ignitions and incentivized to make preventative investments.", "Our Columbia report discusses the nuances embedded in the California legislative response and outlines additional lessons other states can take away from the initiative.", "What Steps Should the Federal Government Consider?", "While much of electricity sector regulation is conducted through state legislatures and public utility commissions, the federal government can take steps to help prevent, mitigate, and adapt to the growing threats presented by wildfires and other climate-change-related disasters.", "Interestingly, this would not be the first time that electric-transmission-related incidents have led to congressional action.", "The Northeast Blackout of 2003—the worst US blackout of all time—was caused by a sagging transmission line in Ohio that came into contact with trees that had not been adequately trimmed.[13] Congress responded by enacting the Energy Policy Act of 2005, which strengthened the North American Electric Reliability Corporation reliability requirements and granted the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) greater ability to levy penalties.", "Congress has an opportunity to take similarly transformative action today.", "First and foremost, Congress should focus on the broad impact climate change will have on our environment, on people, and on our economy.", "The California wildfires are a vivid example of the devastation that climate change will increasingly bring.", "We are encouraged by the efforts of this committee to consider how we can bring together public and private sector leaders to address climate change and US greenhouse gas emissions, including the CLEAN Future Act framework introduced by Energy and Commerce Chairman Pallone, Environment and Climate Change Chairman Tonko, and Energy Subcommittee Chairman Rush that sets new targets to achieve a 100 percent clean economy by 2050.", "As my colleagues Dr. Noah Kaufman and Dr. Julio Friedmann have testified, we need all solutions on the table to decarbonize our economy and to achieve net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050, to avoid the most catastrophic effects of climate change.", "In particular, researchers at the Center on Global Energy Policy have studied decarbonization options available to the federal government in great detail.", "In his recent testimony before the Subcommittee on Environment & Climate Change, Dr. Kaufman argued that a carbon price should be part of any comprehensive climate policy, as it encourages emissions reductions wherever and however they can be achieved at a low cost without needing to know beforehand what those opportunities will be.", "He has further studied the interaction of a carbon tax with other potential climate policies and recommends policies that are complementary rather than redundant to a carbon tax.", "These complementary policies include funding innovation, encouraging energy efficiency investment, and investing directly in low carbon infrastructure, among others.", "Second, massive infrastructure investment will be required to modernize the grid to make it more intelligent and responsive to the demands of a rapidly changing electric sector and to provide resiliency in the face of increasing threats from climate change.", "Although the government has an important role to play in this funding, ultimately this will require large amounts of private sector capital.", "Indeed, challenges of this magnitude cannot be solved without significant private sector investment, and Congress should examine ways that it can encourage such capital flows.", "Public-private partnerships are one vehicle for infrastructure investment of this magnitude. Such partnerships can take many forms, but one mechanism my former colleagues at the Department of Energy and I have advocated is the creation of a National Infrastructure Bank.", "There is a long history with respect to this subject, and there are important legislative and administrative equities that need to be considered, but", "given the pressing infrastructure challenge facing the country, I would strongly encourage Congress to take a fresh look at the possibility of creating such an institution.", "The recent proposal to create a National Climate Bank is a positive step in this direction.", "In addition, FERC could take steps to incentivize greater fire prevention and grid hardening investment in the utility sector.", "FERC regulates interstate electric transmission assets and in the past has used specialized profit incentives (often referred to as “ROE-adder” incentives) and accelerated cost recovery mechanisms to direct private capital toward preferred initiatives such as regional transmission organization participation and transmission enhancement projects.[15]", "Similar mechanisms could provide a financial incentive for utility companies to prioritize grid resiliency and fire prevention investments over other types of investments available to them.", "A large amount of institutional capital is available to invest in infrastructure, and these investors want to invest in energy infrastructure projects if they can meet their risk and return objectives and their fiduciary responsibilities to their investors.", "Third, Congress should support increased research, development, demonstration, and deployment funding for wildfire prevention methods and technologies and grid modernization.", "The Department of Energy and its 17 National Labs provide enormous technical capabilities that are currently being applied to meet these challenges for the nation.", "As a senior advisor to Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, I am aware of the work they are doing to help the California Public Utility Commission in this area.", "Since wildfire and climate-related risks are nationwide risks, other national laboratories such as Idaho National Laboratory and the National Renewable Energy Laboratory have significant technical capabilities that they can also provide to the effort.", "Promising research is being conducted on sensor technology, high altitude wind forecasting, high performance computing for fire simulation and prediction, and underground wiring methods.", "I would like to thank the Subcommittees for holding this hearing on the impact of wildfires on the domestic power sector and the environment.", "The California wildfires should be a call for action regarding the adverse impacts of climate change.", "As tragic as these events have been, one only needs to look at Australia to see the potential for even greater devastation to come as a result of wildfires and other climate-change-related disasters.", "Managing the adverse impacts from climate change will require massive, sustained, and thoughtful investment in technology and infrastructure.", "The first climate change bankruptcy is an important test case for how our country is going to allocate the costs of preventing, mitigating, and responding to climate-change-related disasters among numerous stakeholders, including ratepayers, investors, and state and federal taxpayers.", "While he hasn’t released an official plan, Trump’s playbook the last time he was in office and his frequent complaints about clean energy offer clues to what’s ahead.", "Why is the United States struggling to enact policies to reduce carbon emissions? Conventional wisdom holds that the wealthy and powerful are to blame, as the oligarchs and corporations that wield disproportionate sway over politicians prioritize their short-term financial interests over the climate’s long-term health."]}

Another key provision is reasonable penalties.", "A company that faces a penalty of, say, $50 per day per violation in how they have handled consumer data, where the number of violations is calculated by determining the number of consumers potentially affected, and perhaps also the number of days of violation, quickly could find itself facing potentially billions in penalties.", "In exchange for preemption and reasonable penalties, lawmakers may require that businesses agree to be accountable in various ways for their data practices—keeping data secure, properly training employees, assuring that data is used consistent with the context of the consumer relationship, assuring that any entity with whom data is shared also abides by the rules that apply to the data, and so on.", "They also may provide consumers with specific rights regarding data about them, such as the ability to access the data, to request that inaccurate data be corrected, to opt out of data about them being processed in certain ways, and to request its deletion.", "Some companies—utilities, for example—already may face restrictions with respect to their data under state utility regulation.", "Energy companies already are under legal obligations to keep their systems secure. It will be important to assure that existing regulation is accounted for in federal legislation, to avoid duplication or conflicting requirements.", "If Congress doesn’t act, companies quickly could face widely divergent or conflicting consumer data requirements in multiple states, high penalties, and possibly consumers banding together in class actions to sue for violations.", "Congress is only in the early stages of considering legislation, and a strong consensus has yet to emerge among the business community on the elements that should be in a bill.", "However, the stakes are high and no federal action would bring high risks.

Fossil fuels have long dominated energy supply and transformed society.", "In the 1970s, nuclear energy came into favor as a source of cleaner energy supply because, unlike fossil fuels, it does not produce particulate matter and other air pollutants that are harmful to human health.", "As society confronts an impending global climate crisis, development of non–fossil fuel alternatives is rapidly increasing.", "With each type of energy supply, there are unique impacts on human health and the environment. In the communities where extraction takes place (e.g., coal and uranium mines), air and water pollution impact health and workers suffer from occupational diseases such as black lung.", "Air pollution caused by fossil fuel combustion at coal and natural gas plants and transportation-related pollution create health concerns where energy is produced.", "Waste disposal and radiation exposure are concerns for workers and communities near nuclear plants. Energy efficiency and conservation are seen as effective means of limiting energy use and demand to reduce public health impacts.", "Renewable energy development, although safer from a climate perspective, also poses occupational and environmental health concerns where components are manufactured and installed.", "As society moves to alternative energies, there is a need to monitor, evaluate, and support effective strategies to transition to a healthier energy supply and adopt effective energy efficiency and conservation measures.", "This policy builds upon and replaces APHA Policy Statement 7825(PP) (The Public Health Impact of Energy Policy) from 1978.", "This new policy is also consistent with several other related APHA policy statements, including the following:", "- APHA Policy Statement 201711: Public Health Opportunities to Address the Health Effects of Air Pollution", "- APHA Policy Statement 20157: Public Health Opportunities to Address the Health Effects of Climate Change", "- APHA Policy Statement 20078: Addressing the Urgent Threat of Global Climate Change to Public Health and the Environment", "- APHA Policy Statement 20046: Affirming the Necessity of a Secure, Sustainable and Health Protective Energy Policy", "Energy policy can have a great impact on society and health. Environmental devastation, including climate change, strip mining, plant and animal death caused by oil spills, and emissions from transportation vehicles (e.g., cars, trains, planes) and power plants, is a serious threat to public health and welfare.", "Making the matter more complicated, the United States does not have a unified national energy strategy.", "Instead, national energy sources and legislation are piecemeal, involving different governmental levels.", "As such, lawmakers and regulators at the local, state, and federal levels have a responsibility to ensure that energy policies adequately address the health challenges related to the nation’s varied energy strategy.", "Fossil fuels have been the leading source of energy both in the United States and abroad. In 2015 world governments, including the United States, adopted the Paris Climate Agreement.", "This agreement calls on all nations to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions to levels that would keep global temperatures from warming beyond 2oC of preindustrial levels.", "This includes an aspirational goal of keeping warming below 1.5oC of pre-industrial levels.[1] As the world takes measures to address pollution associated with fossil fuel combustion and transition to alternatives with lower climate impacts, the United States should adopt its energy policies accordingly.", "At the same time, the U.S. government has regressed from global and domestic climate policy, and the United States remains the only nation to have abandoned the global agreement.", "Local and state governments, businesses, and nonstate actors across the country have led efforts to enact climate policies that reduce emissions and protect against climate impacts.[2] Adoption of clean energy policy aiming to achieve energy from 100% renewable sources and energy conservation and efficiency efforts are strategies that can be utilized to reduce the negative public health impacts of energy development, use, and waste and the related consequence of unmitigated climate change.", "Changes in energy policy could have disproportionate economic impacts on vulnerable communities, in particular economically disadvantaged communities, the elderly, and energy industry workers.", "A shift in costs to consumers could occur through the transition and could have a negative effect on economically disadvantaged populations.", "In many places, natural gas currently provides the lowest-cost energy, but renewable sources such as unsubsidized solar and wind are quickly approaching cost parity with traditional fuel sources and offer numerous job opportunities.", "It is expected that renewable energy will become the lowest-cost energy source in the coming decade.[3]", "In underserved communities, renewable energy sources could be a boon offering low-cost energy that is individually or democratically owned and does not involve the negative health impacts of fossil fuels.", "Continued reliance on fossil fuel–based energy comes at a greater cost from direct health impacts and related ecological damage if climate change remains unchecked.", "Furthermore, it is the role of policymakers and regulators at the local, state, and federal levels to be arbiters of a just transition for vulnerable communities, including communities that have faced environmental injustices as a result of living in proximity to polluting energy systems and workers who have both suffered occupational health injuries and benefited from employment in such industries.", "Mining, processing, and combustion of coal result in major occupational and public health costs. “Coal is the world’s most polluting fossil fuel, and coal combustion is an important cause of both pollution and climate change.”[4]", "Pneumoconiosis (commonly known as “black lung disease”) is among the “major epidemics of industrial disease that ravaged workers’ health in the 19th and 20th centuries.", "”[5] Coal workers continue to face substantial occupational risks, including higher rates of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, progressive massive fibrosis, exposure to methane, risks from injury, and hearing loss.[5] There is evidence of a significant resurgence of pneumoconiosis in the Appalachian region.[6]", "In addition, communities living in close proximity to coal-fired power plants face a greater risk of birth defects.[7]", "Coal power plant emissions impact the health of nearby communities; they can also be transported across state and national boundaries to affect distant communities.", "Coal combustion (as when coal is burned in coal-fired power plants to produce electricity) is a major contributor to the “criteria pollutants”: particulate matter (PM2.5), nitrogen oxides (NOx), sulfur dioxide (SO2), ozone (O3), carbon dioxide (CO2), and airborne heavy metals such as mercury.[8] These pollutants are linked to respiratory disease, cardiovascular disease, stroke, diminished cognitive functioning, and adverse birth outcomes.[9,10]", "Coal is a major source of global greenhouse gas emissions (e.g., carbon dioxide, nitrous oxides, and methane), and coal extraction and combustion contribute to global climate change.[11]", "The UCL-Lancet Commission on Climate Change has described GHG emissions as the “greatest global health threat of the 21st century” (see APHA Policy Statement 20157).", "Currently, 40% of the world’s energy comes from coal combustion; however, because coal produces significantly more CO2 per unit of energy than other fuels, it accounts for more than 70% of GHG emissions from the energy sector.[12] Building and operating the coal power plants that are under construction or currently planned globally would jeopardize achieving globally agreed upon emissions reduction targets under the Paris Agreement, placing the public’s health at significant risk.[13]", "Crude oil is another problematic fossil fuel from which petroleum products are made.[14] Cars and trucks are the major consumers of petroleum.[15] Tailpipe emissions from cars and trucks have significant health impacts, and a concentrated effort must be made to reduce health hazards stemming from dependency on these vehicles.[16,17] Other uses of petroleum products include fuel oils for heating and electricity generation; asphalt and road oil; feedstocks for producing chemicals, plastics, and synthetic materials; waxes; ink; crayons; tires; and cleaning and personal care products.[15,18]", "Exposure to crude oil may result in short-term effects ranging from headaches to rashes and long-term effects such as immune system depression and lung, liver, and kidney damage.[18] As with most of the fossil fuels in the United States, oil is typically burned or combusted, which results in the creation of criteria pollutants that are hazardous to the environment and human health.[8,19,20]", "Natural gas (including raw natural gas, natural gas liquids, and other petrochemicals) is a fossil fuel that carries potential risks for humans and the environment as well.[21,22] The most common extraction process, hydraulic fracturing (or fracking), can lead to catastrophic accidents, worker exposures, localized risks to residents, and air, soil, groundwater, and surface water contamination.[21–24]", "Pipelines that transport liquid natural gas are expensive and can leak, causing significant environmental hazards.[22]", "In addition, the fracking process can lead to earthquakes.[24]", "Nuclear power produces a fifth of the nation’s electricity.[25] There are health risks associated with the uranium mining process, ―such as exposure to radiation, silica dust, and PM2.5 from diesel exhaust, and environmental risks of airborne radiation exposure and surface water and groundwater contamination to the general public.[26–28] While large-scale events such as core meltdowns and terrorist attacks may be infrequent, the consequences of such events are disastrous and long term.[26–29]", "Also, there continues to be conflict regarding permanent storage of dangerous nuclear waste.[30] High-level waste, in particular, is thermally hot and toxic, and it remains radioactive for many years.[27,31] Exposure to radioactive waste can lead to cancer, organ failure, or death.[27,32]", "Meanwhile, renewable energy represents a healthier energy source and is the fastest growing area of employment in the energy sector.", "In 2016, 1.1 million employees worked in traditional coal, oil, and gas jobs.[33] By comparison, nearly 800,000 workers were employed in renewables, the nuclear sector, and advanced/low-emission natural gas.[33]", "While the fossil fuel sector added natural gas and oil jobs, coal mining employment declined by 39% from 2009 to 2016.[33]", "There was a 24% decline in 2016 alone. This declining employment in the coal mining sector is primarily the result of competition from natural gas and renewable energy.[34] Oil and gas extraction industry employment grew by 6% between 2009 and 2016.[33]", "The renewable energy sector has grown rapidly in recent years. In 2016 alone, the solar workforce grew by 25% and the wind sector workforce by 32%.[33] Solar job figures are likely higher because existing labor market data do not include jobs in the construction or other value chain industries for projects financed, owned, or directed by utilities.[33]", "As the United States adopts energy efficiency and low-carbon strategies to mitigate emissions, related energy jobs represent a growing sector of the economy.", "In 2016, 2.2 million Americans were employed in jobs related to the design, installation, and manufacture of energy efficiency products and services.[33]", "Nearly three quarters of workers at construction firms involved in the energy efficiency sector are spending at least 50% of their time on work associated with energy efficiency.[33]", "In 2016, 10.8% of employees in the motor vehicle and component parts industry worked with alternative-fuel vehicles, including natural gas, hybrid, plug-in hybrid, electric, and fuel cell/hydrogen vehicles.[33]", "In addition, more than 489,000 employees of motor vehicle parts companies are now contributing to more fuel-efficient vehicles, with 17% of all firms involved in motor vehicle component parts deriving all of their revenue from products that increase fuel economy.[33]", "At least 710,000 jobs in the motor vehicle sector are focused on increasing fuel economy or transitioning to alternative fuels.[33]", "Fossil fuels have been the leading source of energy both in the United States and abroad. In 2015 world governments, including the United States, adopted the Paris Climate Agreement.", "This agreement calls on all nations to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions to levels that would keep global temperatures from warming beyond 2oC of preindustrial levels.", "This includes an aspirational goal of keeping warming below 1.5oC of pre-industrial A well-informed energy strategy and policy is critical.", "The nation’s actions on energy are far reaching. Because of employment, environmental, health, and national security concerns, it is important to form an energy strategy based on solid, evidence-based research.", "As energy is a diverse and complex topic, there are many varied opportunities available to solve the nation’s energy concerns.", "At the same time, the public health impacts of climate change must be taken into consideration. In 2015, as noted, world governments including the United States adopted the Paris Climate Agreement, which calls on all nations to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.[1]", "Greenhouse gas emissions resulting from burning carbon-based energy sources are a major contributor to climate change.", "In October 2018, the International Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) stated clearly that keeping the global temperature rise below 1.5oC would “require rapid and far-reaching transitions” in energy, land, urban infrastructure, and industrial systems to achieve deep decarbonization of the energy supply.", "In addition, the IPCC bluntly noted that this would require achievement of net zero CO2 emissions by 2050, with a steep decline in all climate-related emissions, including CO2, methane, black carbon, nitrous oxide, and aerosols, by 2030.", "In its report, the IPCC further acknowledged that the impacts to human health from extreme heat, vector-borne diseases, heavy precipitation, droughts, and ozone-related mortality would be greater under 2.0oC or warming versus 1.5oC and that the poorest populations are most vulnerable to health-related impacts.[35]", "The scientific evidence for climate action is clear and necessary to protect human health. Over the past few decades, the United States has addressed health impacts related to fossil fuel usage through increasingly stringent measures such as controlling air pollution emissions from coal-fired power plants and combustion-engine vehicles.", "Since 2017, the U.S. government has actively repealed these health-protective rules.. Specifically, the government has attempted to repeal or revise at least 30 environmental rules limiting climate pollution, including expansion of fossil fuel extraction and weakening of regulations that monitor methane emissions at extraction sites on public lands; it has also repealed and replaced the Clean Power Plan and repealed the Corporate Average Fuel Economy standards.", "[35–39] Federal, state, and local governments should adopt policies for a rapid transition to 100% renewable energy while also using energy efficiency and conservation measures to significantly reduce carbon-based emissions to meet the goals of the Paris Climate Agreement.", "In the absence of federal leadership, state and local governments should lead such efforts and challenge federal actions that do not align with climate science and endanger human health.", "Simultaneously adopting energy strategies that mitigate climate change would yield significant health co-benefits and health cost savings.[1]", "There are several strategies that can be employed to mitigate climate change and comply with the Paris Climate Agreement.", "First is the commitment to a global phase out of coal as fuel. Emissions from coal-fired power plants as well as the coal industry at large have extensive harmful effects on coal miners, communities near mining operations or plants, and even communities downwind from these areas.[4–10,40]", "Coal combustion also leads to emission of GHG emissions, exacerbating climate change.[11–13] Communities that bear the greatest immediate burden of disease from coal mining and combustion would be better served by policies and investments that support a simultaneous transition to other appropriate industries and employment opportunities.[41]", "A smooth transition for coal communities can best be achieved within a stable regulatory context that enables companies to invest in a diverse energy portfolio and allows communities to develop educational and job training opportunities that support and align with the shift.[41]", "Fuel economy standards are set by the federal government with options for individual states to set stricter standards to reduce air pollution.", "In the absence of federal leadership, states should act to reduce air pollution. Fuel economy and emissions standards for cars, trucks, and other vehicles are critical to protecting public health.", "In addition, as the market for alternative fuel and electric vehicles expands, renewable energy infrastructure must be created to power electric vehicles and avoid further use of fossil fuel energy and nuclear energy.", "Automobile manufacturers have a critical role to play in producing alternative fuel and electric vehicles.", "Electric utilities can also drive innovation through investment in and development of renewable energy microgrids and utility-scale energy.", "This must be coupled with increased availability of mass transportation and urban planning efforts to increase the prevalence and safety of walkways and bike lanes as a means of further reducing energy use.", "Increasing active transportation and use of public transit offers significant health benefits through increased physical activity.[42,43]", "Moreover, such actions will lead to reductions in costs and energy use, improvements in air quality, and decreases in accidental injuries and deaths.[17,44]", "Natural gas also carries occupational and general public health risks, as do coal and oil.[21–24] In addition, there are significant hazards to the environment, including spills and induced earthquakes.[21–24] Human rights violations and the negative health impacts on indigenous and underresourced communities far outweigh the benefits of this relatively inexpensive fuel.", "Legislators and public health professionals must vigilantly monitor the natural gas industry to protect workers, the environment, and the general public, especially vulnerable populations such as Native American communities and agricultural communities on the frontlines of extraction.", "In addition, the federal government should hold companies accountable for pollution of land and water resources near adversely affected sites.", "Responsible companies should cover the costs associated with the cleaning up and restoration of the land.", "While nuclear power plants do not produce GHG emissions, the possible danger to plant employees and communities near the facility is too great a risk.[27–29]", "Both nuclear generation and the storage of nuclear waste are significant obstacles that have yet to be adequately addressed.[30] Nuclear power should remain a limited component of the nation’s energy mix until these challenges are appropriately dealt with.", "Energy efficiency and energy conservation involve the use of technology and behavior change, respectively, to effectively reduce energy waste, save money, and combat climate change.[45,46]", "Energy efficiency policies can lead to improvements in competitiveness among businesses, job creation, and reductions in air pollution; they can also improve the reliability of the electric grid and increase the nation’s energy independence.[47]", "In addition, fuel economy standards, ENERGY STAR labeling, and government initiatives such as the Weatherization Assistance Program (WAP) can help address human and environmental health.[47]", "Concerns about the accessibility of energy efficiency programs such as the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP) and WAP among households with high energy burdens (i.e., households using a disproportionate amount of their income for utility bills) are overstated and could be resolved through increased federal funding.[45,48,49]", "The “rebound effect” (e.g., using more lighting or appliances because energy-efficient versions have reduced one’s electric bills) does exist, although it is small enough that efficiency measures often still pay for themselves in the end.[45,48,49] Energy efficiency and conservation remain the nation’s most cost-effective energy resource.[50]", "Renewable energy sources such as solar, wind, hydro, and geothermal energy are attractive long-term options.", "Renewables have significantly lower negative health and climate impacts than conventional fossil fuel sources.[51,52]", "In comparison with fossil fuels, which are subject to shortages and demand increases, renewables have stable pricing as costs are relative steady once the necessary infrastructure is in place.[51] Because of the need for new infrastructure and maintenance, the growth of the renewable energy sector would result in significant job creation.[51,52]", "A rapid transition to renewable energy would require significant active leadership and investment at all governmental levels.", "In addition, regulatory certainty is necessary to provide a smooth transition for the training and education of displaced fossil fuel and nuclear workers.", "Public-private partnerships with renewable energy companies could also provide certainty in terms of job placement and encourage investment in new industries and technologies.", "The U.S. energy portfolio and strategy are immensely complex. Special interest groups have levied unreasonable criticism of current practices and policies against several industries that have supported this country for centuries and remain solid viable options for many years to come.", "Fossil fuels (e.g., coal, natural gas, and oil), for example, have several advantages. They are inexpensive, reliable, and relatively abundant and add to the nation’s energy and national security.[53] Coal is cheap, safe to transport, and produces a great deal of energy.[53]", "In addition, some communities that rely on the fossil fuel industry to stimulate the local economy may not be well suited for producing renewable energy as a result of geography or other factors.[51,54] Furthermore, there are legitimate concerns regarding loss of jobs in areas of the country heavily dependent on the coal industry.", "As such, it is important to consider collateral damage that could be suffered by communities that rely on coal and other fossil fuels.", "While there may be legitimate concerns about emissions for coal-fired power plants, emerging technologies such as carbon capture, sequestration, and scrubbing are increasingly effective and affordable.[55]", "Natural gas has become increasingly inexpensive and easy to access.[22] This has resulted in more efficient transportation vehicles, less air pollution (relative to coal or oil combustion), and energy independence, subsequently leading to stronger national security as the United States becomes less reliant on foreign nations for its energy.[22,56]", "Moreover, the natural gas and oil industries support millions of jobs and contribute more than $1 trillion to the U.S. economy, and the low cost of natural gas and oil allows for affordable prices, reducing energy insecurity in vulnerable communities.[57,58]", "While one of the processes for extracting natural gas―hydraulic fracturing―can lead to induced earthquakes, these events are rare.[24]", "Nuclear power now provides a significant percentage (approximately 20%) of the nation’s electricity.[25] This industry is generally very well regulated and secure.[26,28,59]", "Furthermore, the nuclear power generation process does not produce GHG emissions.[28,59] Risks of large-scale accidents such as reactor meltdowns are relatively rare and are usually the result of human error as opposed to inherent problems with the technology.[26,28,29,59]", "Although nuclear power is not risk free, plants are constructed with several layers of protection that have proven to be very effective.[28,29]", "While there are indeed some challenges regarding a permanent solution for storage of high-level nuclear waste (e.g., at the Yucca Mountain site), current temporary storage sites are more than safe and secure.[31]", "The upfront costs of energy efficiency can be high.[50] Furthermore, programs such as LIHEAP and WAP are not always accessible and have limited reach.[60,61]", "This dynamic tends to benefit high-income households that can readily afford the costs associated with efficiency work.[60,61]", "In addition, the “rebound effect” has been observed in serval instances (e.g., individuals with a hybrid vehicle driving more often since their car goes farther on less fuel).", "Up to 30% of energy savings can be lost due to this effect.[62]", "The basic infrastructure, building of components, and storage for renewables can be cost prohibitive.[51,54] Similar to energy efficiency, upfront costs can be very high.", "In addition, many renewables cannot be produced in large quantities, and options are subject to weather conditions.[51]", "This is problematic, as the nation requires reliable power sources that are accessible regardless of whether or not the sun is shining and the wind is blowing.", "Lastly, renewables are not feasible everywhere. Some regions of the country lack the necessary natural resources, such as solar intensity, wind, water, and space (i.e., large landmass areas), to be able to practically pursue this energy source.[51,54]", "While these opposing concerns warrant consideration, as discussed above the health and economic benefits of shifting to 100% renewable energy and increased energy efficiency and conservation significantly outweigh the costs of such changes or the benefits of sustaining the current approach.", "- Coal mine health and safety laws should be vigorously enforced by the U.S. Department of Labor and the Mine Safety and Health Administration.", "- Mining companies should provide up-to-date health and safety technologies (e.g., improved ventilation, illumination, reduction of noise levels, mechanical roof bolters, dust control technology, gas monitoring).", "- Local, state, and federal energy policies should place a premium on mitigating the health effects of coal combustion.", "- There should be a complete and expedient phase out of coal for energy use at the national level, coupled with simultaneous institution of educational and employment opportunities in affected areas.", "- Congress should provide federal funding for research on health effects and pollution prevention strategies.", "- Operations of new coal-fired power plants should be suspended, and plans for future plants should be canceled.", "- Congress and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) should establish strengthened emission performance standards for existing plants, and these plants should eventually be upgraded or phased out.", "- Congress should establish fuel economy and emissions standards for cars, trucks, and other vehicles commensurate with the most ambitious current state standards and continue to make standards more stringent.", "- Automakers should begin a complete phase out of fossil fuel use for transportation vehicles.", "- Gas companies should cease dangerous hydraulic fracturing (fracking) and construction of pipelines across vulnerable lands.", "- Local, state, and federal lawmakers should deny approval of international or interstate pipeline construction.", "- The Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) should establish guidelines to ensure that occupational radioactive exposures are kept “as low as reasonably achievable” below current limits throughout the fuel cycle.", "- The NRC, Department of Energy (DOE), and EPA should further evaluate the health and safety aspects of breeder reactors to ensure that public health and safety is a predominant concern.", "The federal government should operate or closely supervise fuel reprocessing and waste disposal activities.", "- NRC control of carcinogens in the nuclear cycle should be approached in the same way that radioactive emissions are treated in the coal fuel cycle.", "- Congress should set a moratorium on the construction of new nuclear power plants (see APHA Policy Statement 7909).", "- The DOE and EPA should create effective labeling with respect to the energy efficiency of energy-consuming products and buildings.", "- The DOE and EPA should establish effective appliance and equipment efficiency standards and energy codes for homes and commercial buildings.", "- Local, state, and federal lawmakers should establish funding for programs that will help consumers and businesses improve their energy efficiency and reduce emissions and waste.", "- Individuals and families should take advantage of retrofits of homes, especially in areas with low-income housing, to reduce energy bills and improve indoor air quality.", "- The business community should improve industrial facilities to reduce their energy waste, waste of resources, and emissions.", "- There should be universal recycling of materials.", "- Individuals, families, and businesses, as well as local, state, and federal government agencies, should expand adoption of diverse energy resources such as wind and solar.", "- Local, state, and federal lawmakers should offer financial incentives to encourage expanded use.", "- There should be expanded congressional funding of federal programs such as WAP and LIHEAP.", "1.

"https://www.chesapeakebaymagazine.com/exelon-relicensed-to-operate-conowingo-dam-for-next-50-years-after-long-fight/", "url2text": ["Federal regulators have approved the relicensing of the Conowingo Dam, blessing a controversial deal that Maryland reached with the dam’s owner over its responsibility to help clean up pollution of the Susquehanna River and Chesapeake Bay.", "The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission issued a brief press release Thursday announcing its decision to grant Exelon Corp. a new 50-year license to operate the dam, ending nearly eight years of study and debate.", "“The license includes conditions to enhance fish migration, protect bald eagles and other wildlife, upgrade 13 public recreation sites, address sediment issues and protect archaeological and historic sites,” the release said.", "The order, which has yet to be released, incorporates settlements negotiated between Exelon, the Maryland Department of the Environment and U.S. Department of the Interior.", "The deals address fish and eel passage upriver, as well as sediment and nutrient pollution flowing downriver past the dam.", "An Exelon spokeswoman said the company was waiting to see the order before commenting.", "MDE Secretary Ben Grumbles called the announcement by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission “encouraging news for the Susquehanna River and the Chesapeake Bay after almost a decade of gridlock.”", "He said state officials are “committed to working with citizens and stakeholders immediately on environmental and climate resiliency projects included in the FERC-approved settlement” and to taking additional actions as well.", "Environmentalists, however, lambasted the commission’s decision, accusing it of accepting a deal that requires far too little of Exelon to compensate for the environmental problems caused by the dam.", "“Exelon has been let off the hook, and [the] state let it happen,” said Ted Evgeniadis, the Lower Susquehanna Riverkeeper.", "“The Lower Susquehanna and the Chesapeake Bay will suffer because of today’s decision.”", "The 94-foot high dam straddles the lower Susquehanna in Maryland, about 10 miles upstream from the Bay.", "Its river-driven turbines generate enough electricity to power 165,000 homes, according to Exelon.", "But since its completion in 1928, it has effectively blocked many migratory fish from getting upriver to spawn.", "It’s likewise hampered the upriver migration of American eels, which in turn has depleted freshwater mussels that once helped filter nutrients and sediments out of the river.", "Exelon agreed nearly five years ago to upgrade its main fish lift at Conowingo to help more spawning American shad and river herring move upriver.", "But actions Exelon agreed to take, including trucking fish upriver past three other dams, were put on hold amid disputes over the company’s responsibility for cleaning up nutrient and sediment pollution passing through the dam.", "The dam also has complicated Bay restoration efforts because the 14-mile reservoir it creates has reached its capacity to trap sediment from upstream sources.", "As a result, more nutrients and sediment from farm runoff, municipal wastewater and stormwater are flowing into the Chesapeake, where they contribute to algae blooms and other water quality woes.", "And whenever a storm hits or heavy rains fall, as they did in 2018, the engorged river flushes sediment and nutrients that have built up behind the dam downriver.", "Those surges also carry trash and debris downriver to the Bay, littering shores and marinas.", "The settlement Exelon and the MDE announced in October 2019 requires the company to spend more than $200 million total over the next 50 years on projects intended to rebuild eel, mussel and migratory fish populations in the river and to reduce nutrient and sediment pollution flowing into the Upper Bay.", "But environmentalists, a coalition of rural Maryland local officials and others criticized the deal, saying it didn’t come close to dealing with the water quality issues caused by the dam.", "They appealed to the commission more than a year ago to reject the settlement and force the parties back to the negotiating table.", "Environmentalists contend that the settlement doesn’t require nearly enough from Exelon to compensate for the water quality problems and storm risks the dam poses, and that it lacks sufficient teeth to ensure that the company even does what it has promised to.", "They warn that Maryland taxpayers could be forced to pay for cleanup of pollution attributable to the dam.", "“The Susquehanna River is a public resource and should not be sold off to a private company for exclusive use without ensuring that the impacts to the public have been properly mitigated, said Betsy Nicholas, executive director of Waterkeepers Chesapeake.", "She said her group would be considering “all legal options” to protect the river and Bay in response to the commission’s action.", "You can read this story in its entirety at bayjournal.com."]}

If all of the parties accept the terms within two weeks, the PSC would automatically approve Exelon’s purchase of Pepco, with no further review or vote required.", "This set off a lot of speculation about how quickly or easily the deal would be approved. We are happy to report that hasty judgments that Exelon would quickly achieve victory are far from true.", "If even one of the nine parties backs out, the deal could be dead, or be subject to further review.", "And there are plenty of reasons for them to do it. But first a little refresher on why this is so important for those concerned about clean energy and a nuclear-free, carbon-free future.", "Exelon is by far the largest nuclear power plant operator in the country, running 23 reactors in six states and holding an ownership stake in two others, plus five shutdown reactors.", "Over one-fourth of Exelon’s reactors are unprofitable and losing millions of dollars each year, placing them at imminent risk of retirement.", "Given that nuclear power is the core of Exelon’s business, it is under pressure to boost its bottom line by whatever means necessary.", "Hence, the company is pushing legislators and regulators from Illinois to New York to DC to deliver massive subsidies for nuclear power plants.", "And it has stepped up its attacks on renewable energy in the same fashion: blocking renewable energy legislation in Illinois for the last two years, and trying to kill federal renewable energy programs.", "But Wall Street has also been telling Exelon it needs to shift away from nuclear power. And that is why, in 2014, it offered Pepco a deal it couldn’t refuse: to buy out the company and its shareholders to the tune of $6.8 billion, 25% more than the company’s stock was worth.", "Pepco was literally the best option for Exelon: with 2 million captive ratepayers, and adjacent to utilities it already owned in Pennsylvania and Maryland, Pepco would give Exelon an unprecedented regional monopoly.", "The problem: people in Maryland and DC have been fighting for renewable energy and real climate justice policies for years.", "They knew Exelon would be a disaster for consumers and the environment alike. And with vigorous grassroots organizing and legal interventions, we won round one.", "After Maryland only narrowly approved the deal (with over 50 pages of conditions), DC’s Public Service Commission rejected it in August, pointing out Exelon’s long track record opposing renewable energy, the loss of local control with a utility headquartered in Chicago, and the company’s inherent conflict of interest in selling its nuclear power at the highest price possible.", "That set off a desperate effort by Exelon and Pepco to seek out a settlement with the city government.", "The Mayor’s decision to go along with Exelon at the same time that Pepco gave the city $25 million for a soccer stadium and Exelon hired the chairman of her political action committee as a lobbyist have raised serious concerns about corruption (see the timeline below).", "If Exelon’s takeover of Pepco were the clean energy equivalent of the Titanic, then the equivalent of rearranging the deck chairs rather than heading to the lifeboats.", "The terms offered by the PSC are actually worse – even for the Mayor and other officials who joined the settlement:", "• $28 million in bill credits intended to lessen the impact of Exelon rate hikes until 2019 on residential customers are now out the window.", "PSC says it will apply the credits to all customers (businesses and government). Residential customers would see their bills go up long before the Mayor’s re-election campaign in 2018.", "• $9 million toward low-income customer assistance, also gone.", "• Other monies that the Mayor would have had the discretion to spend on renewable energy projects (or not) would now be under the PSC’s authority, to prevent the Mayor from diverting them to other budgetary purposes.", "These happen to be the very terms district officials were using to justify their support for the deal.", "Without them, Exelon’s rate hikes mean nothing but misery to district ratepayers. That would have been the case long-term anyway, but now the Mayor and others will be exposed to the political repercussions of supporting Exelon.", "So it is really down to whether Exelon’s corporate influence is more powerful than the threat of an angry electorate.", "There are other significant terms, too, including forcing Exelon to bid out micro-grid and solar projects to competitive providers, rather than being able to own and profit from them itself.", "Exelon could probably live with that. Also, the PSC’s chair, Betty Anne Kane, issued a strong and principled minority opinion opposing the terms offered by the other two commissioners.", "Kane reiterated the view that the Exelon-Pepco deal is inherently flawed, both because of the inevitable loss of local control and Exelon’s fundamental conflict of interest in being both the utility and a major nuclear generator.", "Before the PSC decisions, Exelon had said it would walk away from the deal if it wasn’t decided by March 4.", "And here is a timeline of Exelon’s and Pepco’s scandal-ridden effort to squeeze their rotten deal through.", "(Timeline compiled by NIRS and Chesapeake Climate Action Network from news reports and public documents.)", "SUMMARY OF SCANDAL-PLAGUED EVENTS LEADING UP TO FINAL EXELON-PEPCO MERGER DECISION", "April of 2015: FreshPAC launched.

Researchers have not been able to find another deal like it in the country.", "Not only is all the money paid up front, at a very high price (proportionally more than the Verizon Center naming rights deal), but the brevity and minimized complexity of the two-page legal agreement is virtually unprecedented.", "September 19, 2015: Exelon presents merger “settlement” financial terms the day after “Soccergate” payment.", "Documents released under the Freedom of Information Act show that, the very next day after the soccer deal, Exelon submits new financial information to the Mayor’s office for settlement purposes.", "November 10, 2015: FreshPAC is disbanded after widespread criticism.

Documents released under the Freedom of Information Act indicate that the Mayor’s office repeatedly misled the public as to who in her administration actually coordinated and led the merger settlement negotiations between the city and Exelon.", "The Mayor claimed and still claims that City Administrator Rashad Young and Tommy Wells, head of the Department of the Environment and Energy, led the negotiations.", "But FOIA documents show that they were informed of key settlement terms after the deal had been negotiated by others close to the Mayor.", "Who actually led those talks, and what connection to Exelon or Pepco the city negotiators might have had, is still not known.", "But it was not Wells or Young, as was claimed. Why the discrepancy?", "February 26, 2016: PSC gives conditional approval to the merger. Little substantive changes were required on top of the Mayor’s wholly inadequate settlement.", "Opponents assert the merger is still a fundamental “conflict of interest” and the process was clearly influenced by big-money “pay-to-play” politics.", "Permalink: https://www.nirs.org/one-more-chance-to-defeat-exelon/", "Your contributions make publication of GreenWorld possible.

Indeed, as systemic therapy leads to better distant disease control, local tumor control would be expected to become of greater importance, similar to the evolution of breast cancer therapy.5 Further, although patients with unresectable disease may not be cured, they may experience a better quality of life and prolongation of survival through better local tumor control, as local progression can cause significant morbidity and eventual death.", "Improvements in radiation technique (eg, intensity modulated radiation therapy [IMRT], 3-dimensional image guidance, immobilization, motion management) have resulted in decreased toxicity and improved tolerability of standard dose radiation with concurrent chemotherapy, and strong interest exists in using these techniques for dose escalation to ultimately achieve better local control for pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma.6", "Recently published, the American Society for Radiation Oncology clinical practice guidelines for pancreatic cancer cite the need for prospective dose-escalation studies in the face of multiple series reporting improved local control with higher biologically effective doses.", "Further, for cases of LAPC, not appropriate for downstaging to future surgery, a conditional recommendation with 85% consensus includes dose-escalated chemoradiation or multifraction SBRT after systemic chemotherapy as definitive treatment options.7", "Data regarding the benefits of dose escalation in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma as well as the use of stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) are emerging.", "For example, freedom from local progression has been demonstrated in rates in excess of 80% to 90% at 12 months in patients with LAPC treated with SBRT (25 Gy × 1).8–10 As to be expected with dose escalation, the major concern, based on observations from early experiences, has been duodenal toxicity.", "More recently, fractionated SBRT appears to be favored at most institutions to safely meet constraints.9,11 In a multi-institutional, prospective phase 2 trial, Herman et al treated 49 patients with SBRT (33 Gy in 5 fractions [fx]) and reported a freedom-from-local-progression rate of 78% at 1 year, as well as a low rate of acute and late gastrointestinal toxicity.12 Shaib et al recently published results of a phase-1 dose-escalation study of SBRT for borderline resectable patients who did not reach dose-limiting toxicity at the highest dose level (45 Gy/3 fx).13 In terms of hypofractionated intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT), a Korean study evaluating almost 500 patients with pancreatic cancer found that patients receiving ≥61 Gy had improved freedom from local failure, progression-free survival, and overall survival.14 Further, the experience at MD Anderson Cancer Center with escalated-dose radiation (EDR, defined as a biological equivalent dose [BED] > 70 Gy), using IMRT planning in 15 to 28 fx (67.5–70 Gy), yielded better tolerability as far as gastrointestinal and overall toxicities compared with standard-dose radiation (50.4 Gy/28 fx) with concurrent chemotherapy in addition to improved overall survival and local- and regional-recurrence-free survival.15,16 Colbert et al published a dosimetric feasibility study suggesting that 60 Gy/5 fx may be feasible while still meeting dose constraints to organs at risk (OARs) and maintaining adequate coverage of the gross tumor volume (GTV) in well-selected patients.", "Such an approach requires reduced planning target volumes (PTVs) made possible by utilization of image guidance (IGRT) and motion management techniques, and these doses are currently being evaluated in a prospective clinical trial (NCT: NCT003340974).17 Finally, EDR has been delivered safely with concurrent chemotherapy (capecitabine and gemcitabine) in multiple studies.14,16", "Simultaneous-integrated boost and tumor vessel interface", "A common approach to dose escalation for LAPC is using a simultaneous integrated boost (SIB), in which the totality of the tumor is encompassed by a set dose while a volume that spares bowel structures receives a higher dose during the same fraction (ie, dose painting).", "From a dosimetric and biological point of view, SIB has the practical benefit of saving time over a sequential boost.", "Because most SIB fractionation regimens use 15 to 28 treatments, higher doses to the tumor and surrounding nodes can be achieved compared with SBRT in general.18 Some have argued that an SIB approach to the hypoxic center of a tumor may have benefits for treating resistant clones while also allowing for lower radiation doses that are both safe for normal tissues and effective for microscopic disease (eg, in areas abutting the gastrointestinal tract).4 The tumor–evessel interface (TVI) has been found to be a region at high risk for recurrence and may lie outside of the primary tumor volume.", "Zhu et al retrospectively reviewed 217 locoregional recurrences after SBRT and found that approximately one-third of patients recurred near the celiac trunk and superior mesenteric artery (SMA).19 Additionally, Kharofa et al studied patterns of marginal local failures in a phase 2 prospective trial of neoadjuvant chemotherapy and 5-fraction SBRT for locally advanced pancreatic cancer.", "In this trial, “PTV33” was defined as a 3-mm expansion from the GTV and included tumor and vessel in contact with tumor.", "They found that local failures were mostly observed outside of the “PTV33,” but within volumes that would have been treated with conventional radiation (areas of clinical microscopic risk).", "This is consistent with what is known about the neurotropic spread of LAPC along mesenteric vessels and the high rate of perivascular recurrences in patients after resection.", "The authors concluded that omission of mesenteric vasculature may predispose patients to a higher risk of recurrence, thus favoring techniques providing coverage of at-risk vascular target volumes.20 Finally, in addition to lowering the risk of local recurrence, it is thought that targeting the TVI may also improve the likelihood of a negative surgical margin in patients who eventually undergo surgery.", "The utilization of SIB and targeting of the TVI in SBRT are referenced in the recent American Society for Radiation Oncology guidelines.7", "Case 1: 15-Fraction Hypofractionated IMRT With SIB", "A 70-year-old woman presented with decreased appetite, abdominal pain, and weight loss. Computed tomography (CT) of the abdomen revealed a 2.9-cm mass extending from the head of the pancreas to superiorly and inferiorly surround the celiac axis (CA) and abut the SMA by 180°.", "The superior mesenteric vein (SMV), portal vein, and splenic vein were free from tumor, although mild abutment existed at the confluence.", "No lymphadenopathy was appreciated. After neoadjuvant chemotherapy with gemcitabine and abraxane for 8 cycles, the patient maintained a stable pancreatic head mass with continued encasement of the celiac trunk and abutment of the SMA.", "In addition, MRI revealed probable abutment of the common hepatic and splenic artery and the SMV and splenoportal confluence (Fig 1).", "At this point, given stable, unresectable disease without distant metastasis, the patient was referred for chemoradiation with concurrent capecitabine and was identified as a candidate for EDR and planned for treatment to 6750 cGy in 15 fx.", "The patient was simulated under the following conditions: 3 hours NPO, supine position with arms up, immobilized with a custom cradle in a wing board to ensure setup reproducibility.", "IV contrast was infused at a fixed rate (5 cm3/s) and coordinated with the acquisition of the images, with timing similar to a triphasic, pancreas-protocol CT scan.21 Respiratory correlated breath-hold CT was used in which a marker in combination with video feedback guided the patient into a series of reproducible breath-holds.", "A series of CTs were acquired to test patient suitability for treatment with breath-hold and the potential benefits of this technique in terms of reductions to organs at risk.", "For this patient, IGRT was planned using CT-on-Rails with setup to GTV daily.", "Target volume creation (internal GTV, CTV, and OAR)", "To fully appreciate the location of the GTV, the tumor is evaluated on all triphasic diagnostic scans (CT and magnetic resonance imaging [MRI]) and on CT simulation images to create an internal GTV (iGTV).", "The iGTV is defined by the complete extent of tumor, accounting for variability in tumor position among the breath-hold scans.", "In this case of EDR, the clinical target volume (CTV) comprises a 10-mm uniform expansion from the iGTV and may need to be further expanded to include areas at risk of microscopic extension and nodal elective irradiation around the CA, SMA, and SMV (generally starting at the origin of the arteries and including the vessels at the same axial slice levels as the GTV).", "The CTV can extend into bowel structures, ensuring coverage of microscopic risk of disease in the adjacent duodenum and nodal basins.", "The goal is to treat this comprehensive volume to a lower dose level (3750 cGy), thereby respecting the duodenum tolerance (Dmax 45 Gy).", "Meanwhile, no CTV is defined for the high-dose target (6750 cGy); rather, a planning structure is constructed directly from the iGTV (with minimal or no expansion) and modified based on adjacent, dose-limiting duodenum and other luminal OARs.", "The iGTV and CTV are displayed in Figure 2A on axial slices at the level between the CA and SMA. The duodenum, small and large bowel, stomach, liver, common bile duct, and spleen are contoured as OARs (Fig 2B).", "Of note, the bowel structures are contoured on all respiratory gated scans (typically 3–4 scans) and are referred to as iBowel.", "Distinguishing the anatomy of the gastrointestinal tract allows for selection of optimized beam angles for IMRT to reduce toxicity.", "For instance, the small and large bowel have different radiation tolerances, and it may be useful or necessary to contour the duodenum to prevent hotspots.", "Indeed, one of the more worrisome toxicities from high doses near the bowel is a bleeding ulcer.

The man, believed to be Juan Ochoa, left the board by April 2020 — after word of the feds’ corruption probe had leaked.", "Anyway, you get the idea. Other allegations include favored law firms hired to represent ComEd, youths from Madigan’s district placed in ComEd’s internship program, and so forth.", "Prosecutors estimate that from 2011 to 2019, payments to Madigan’s friends, all funneled through contracts for lobbying or other services, totaled $1.3 million.", "ComEd was charged with one count of bribery. The company agreed to the $200 million fine, plus a deferred-prosecution agreement for three years, plus full cooperation against any other individuals who might be implicated in the case.", "That clearly means Madigan, and probably former ComEd executives as well.", "Under the federal sentencing guidelines, ComEd would typically have faced a fine of $240 million to $480 million.", "So how did the company land at $200 million, 20 percent below the bottom end of the range?", "Strong compliance reforms, according to the DPA. Let’s take a look.", "First, ComEd provided substantial cooperation, including an expedited investigation, frequent presentations to federal investigators, and disclosure of additional information “that would not have been otherwise available to the government.”", "Granted, ComEd did not self-report its misconduct voluntarily; all these efforts only came after the company started receiving subpoenas.", "Second, ComEd has parted ways with the employees and third parties involved in the misconduct. This includes former CEO Pramaggiore, who abruptly retired last year from her job with Exelon last October.", "Third, the company created the new role of executive vice president for compliance and audit; and hired David Glockner, a former top prosecutor for the U.S. attorney’s office in Chicago, to fill the job.", "Fourth, the company implemented a new system to track any request for something of value from public officials, including hiring requests.", "Fifth, it established several new compliance policies, such as no more sub-contracting of lobbying or consulting contracts, since that sleight-of-hand was how ComEd hid its no-show jobs from outside eyes.", "All lobbyists and political consultants who do get hired must be approved by Exelon’s chief ethics and compliance officer, Kristopher Keyes.", "And sixth, the usual clause about “ongoing monitoring of all third party lobbyists … to ensure they are providing value to the business.”", "Those compliance steps, taken already, brought ComEd’s penalty down to $200 million. The question now is what other compliance steps ComEd will need to take in the future to hold up the rest of its bargain with the feds.", "Attachment B in the deferred-prosecution agreement lists all the elements of a strong corporate compliance program that ComEd will need to maintain.", "They are nothing that compliance professionals haven’t heard many times before: policies & procedures, periodic review of the program, training, proper oversight, and so forth.", "Anyone with any FCPA experience could recite those elements in their sleep.", "High-level commitment, however — that’s one element that has me wondering.", "One important figure in this drama is Christopher Crane, Exelon’s CEO. Crane has been Exelon’s CEO since 2012, and since Exelon is ComEd’s parent company, he has also served on the board of ComEd since 2012.", "Moreover, Crane actually began his career with the business in 1998 working for ComEd.", "So where was Crane during the 2010s, when ComEd was doing all these favors for Madigan? Where was he when former CEO Pramaggiore put a Madigan crony on the board right next to Crane?", "If Crane didn’t know about these shenanigans — which I find hard to believe, since Crane joined ComEd in 1998 — how did he not know?", "ComEd is a significant Exelon subsidiary, accounting for $5.7 billion of Exelon’s $34.4 billion in revenue in 2019.", "ComEd is also a Chicago institution. So is Madigan. So is corruption. How could the confluence of those three things slide under Crane’s nose?", "In a statement Exelon released Friday, Crane said this:", "We are committed to maintaining the highest standards of integrity and ethical behavior. In the past, some of ComEd’s lobbying practices and interactions with public officials did not live up to that commitment.", "When we learned about the inappropriate conduct, we acted swiftly to investigate. We concluded from the investigation that a small number of senior ComEd employees and outside contractors orchestrated this misconduct, and they no longer work for the company.", "That’s great, but there are still questions about leadership and oversight of ComEd. I’m curious to see how the high-level commitment promised in the DPA will intersect with questions about Crane’s role as a ComEd board member.", "One detail that worries me not one bit: Glockner’s independence and ability. This is a new role, where Glockner reports directly to the audit committee and the CEO, and he has deep ties to the U.S. attorney’s office running the ComEd investigation.", "Yes, there’s a whiff of the regulatory-corporate revolving door here — but in this instance, that might work in favor of strong ethics and complaince."]}

Unlike other States, Illinois did not enact deregulation legislation requiring divestiture of power generation and allowed electric utilities a choice of how they wished to pursue the transition.", "These regulatory changes resulted in the transformation of the power industry by the early 2000s from a number of separate vertically integrated utilities to a network of businesses where the various elements of the supply chain were being operated separately and interacted through market-based contracts and power exchanges.", "To face the challenges of the changing market, Unicom decided to evaluate its operations in Illinois, including its nuclear and fossil fuel power plants.", "Although Unicom management believed the company was well positioned to succeed in the new market structure, the study revealed that Unicom would have to make significant changes to its operation model in order to stay competitive long term.", "Unicom and ComEd considered multiple options, including continued operation with accelerated depreciation, indefinite suspension from operation, a sale of assets to a third party, and retirement or closure of assets.", "Unicom needed of cash to maintain and expand its nuclear generation facilities and distribution system.", "After determining that operation of fossil fuel power plants would bring less value than immediate sale, Unicom decided in July 1998 that it was time to divest itself entirely of its fossil-fueled power generation business.", "At that time Unicom estimated it would receive approximately $2.5 billion from the sale.", "Unicom started looking for an appropriate buyer for its fossil fuel power plants in 1999. One prospective buyer offered Unicom $3 billion for the plants.", "Unicom's management, however, believed that the company could get a better deal. Eventually, Edison Mission offered Unicom $4.8 billion for the fossil fuel power plants, almost twice the initial estimate.", "The $4.8 billion offer would enable ComEd to upgrade its nuclear plants and make the necessary investments in its distribution system.", "On March 22, 1999, ComEd entered into an asset sale agreement with Edison Mission (EME agreement). To effect the sale, ComEd transferred its interests in the fossil fuel power plants to UII pursuant to an agreement dated May 11, 1999, subject to the EME agreement.", "UII agreed to pay ComEd $4.813 billion for the assets, in the form of a demand note in the amount of $2.35 billion and the difference in interest-bearing term notes.", "After receipt of the assets, UII would immediately transfer the assets to Edison Mission and receive $4.813 billion in cash.", "Immediately after receipt of the cash, UII would pay the $2.35 billion aggregate principal due to ComEd under the demand note.", "UII would pay the amount due under the demand note with interest-bearing term notes. Upon the notes' maturity, UII would pay the principal amount of the notes.", "Edison Mission acted through its subsidiary, Midwest Generation.

Pursuant to EME agreement terms, UII transferred the Collins and Powerton stations to State Street Bank & Trust Co. (State Street), the qualified intermediary for the putative like-kind exchange described more fully in the following sections, and State Street then transferred the stations to Edison Mission in exchange for the consideration described above.", "In its filings with the ICC, ComEd represented that the sale would not impair ComEd's obligations to provide power to customers because ComEd would be buying back the output generated by the sold power plants for a number of years and would also be able to buy energy on the open market.", "ComEd planned to reinvest some of the proceeds in its remaining lines of business and to pay the transaction expenses.", "III. Unicom's Search for Tax Planning Opportunities", "After Unicom announced the planned sale of the fossil fuel power plants in May 1999, it became clear that there would be a large taxable gain resulting from the sale.", "Unicom diligently searched for opportunities to minimize the tax impact and to reinvest some of the proceeds of the sale.", "Richard Roling, assistant vice president of tax and assistant comptroller at Unicom from the early 1990s through 2001, was responsible for the tax function at Unicom, including filing tax returns, planning, research, and ensuring compliance with the tax laws.", "In 1999 Mr. Roling reported to Robert E. Berdelle, controller of Unicom at the time. Mr. Berdelle's responsibilities included safeguarding Unicom's assets, maintaining books and records, and issuing financial reports and regulatory filings.", "Furthermore, Mr. Berdelle supervised Unicom's tax department, along with Unicom's business planning and other functions.", "Mr. Roling approached Arthur Andersen (Unicom's auditor at the time), Pricewaterhouse Coopers (PwC), and Deloitte to identify the appropriate tax strategy.", "Arthur Andersen presented Unicom with a strategy involving a foreign currency swap, but Mr. Roling rejected it because it was too complex and did not align with the existing Unicom business.", "PwC first presented the idea of a like-kind exchange coupled with a sale-leaseback to Unicom sometime in August and September 1999.", "In essence, PwC suggested that its strategy would allow Unicom to defer the recognition of gain on Unicom's sale of the fossil fuel power plants through a section 1031 like-kind exchange into a \"passive leveraged lease investment.\"", "Instead of paying the tax on the gain, Unicom would be able to reinvest that sum. The deferred tax would be financially similar to a 0% borrowing note.", "By reinvesting it, Unicom could receive a significant yield premium. Moreover, leveraging the new lease in such a manner would leave Unicom in substantially the same cash position.", "The PwC strategy envisioned a lease term in the range of 20-25 years with an \"enhancement and defeasance structure providing for AA rated or better enhancement of the lessee's entire financial obligations to Unicom.\"", "PwC compared the costs for maintaining the new lease investment with maintaining a typical debt private placement.", "Under the strategy, Unicom would lease the exchange assets to the lessee under a triple net lease with an end-of-term fixed purchase option.", "Unicom would pass on a portion of its tax deferral benefit to the lessees through a reduction in rental obligation.", "The lessee would \"defease its rental obligations, and thereby monetize the lower rental cost into an upfront cash benefit.\"", "The final structure of the like-kind exchange and sale-leaseback was different, as explained further in this Opinion.", "PwC pointed out to petitioner that municipal utilities and rural electric cooperatives seeking to monetize tax benefits they could not use because of their tax-exempt status would be interested in entering into a sale-leaseback transaction.", "PwC also suggested that taxable entities desiring to obtain low cost/off-balance-sheet financing alternatives might also be interested.", "After the initial consultation with PwC, Mr. Roling decided to present the idea of the like-kind exchange to his superiors.", "IV. Unicom's Decision To Enter Into the Test Transactions", "Mr. Roling first presented the PwC strategy to Mr. Berdelle. Although Mr. Berdelle initially did not fully understand the strategy, he decided it had promise and was in line with Unicom's tax strategy.", "John C.

That team consisted of a number of Unicom's employees from various departments, including the tax department, treasury and finance departments, engineers, and outside consultants.", "Core members of the team, including Mr. Berdelle, Robert Hanley, a tax department employee, and Mr. Roling, would meet weekly, if not more often, to discuss the status of the project.", "Neither Mr. Roling nor anyone on his staff in the tax department had any experience with like-kind exchanges.", "Because Unicom did not have the internal expertise necessary to adequately assess all of the legal and technical aspects of the proposed like-kind exchange, Unicom employed a number of consultants and advisers to work on the project, including performing due diligence of potential replacement properties.", "Unicom retained a Chicago law firm, Winston & Strawn LLP (Winston & Strawn) to advise on the legal aspects of the transaction, including its tax consequences.", "In addition, in March or April of 2000 Unicom engaged Stone & Webster Management Consultants, Inc. (Stone & Webster), to provide engineering and environmental reports on prospective replacement properties.", "Unicom retained Deloitte to conduct an appraisal of the relinquished properties and potential replacement properties in November 1999.", "In addition, petitioner engaged PwC (financial and accounting adviser), Arthur Andersen (accounting adviser), Sidley Austin (regulatory counsel), Vinson & Elkins (Texas counsel), and Holland & Knight (Georgia counsel).", "V. Identification of Properties To be Relinquished in the Like-Kind Exchange", "On or about December 9, 1999, six days before the closing of the sale under the EME agreement, Unicom identified the Collins and Powerton stations as the properties it would try to exchange for like-kind replacement properties.", "Mr. Roling concluded, on the basis of the valuations from Deloitte, that the fair market value of the Collins station at that time was $930 million, with an expected taxable gain of $823 million, while the fair market value of Powerton station was $870 million, with an expected taxable gain of $683 million.", "Unicom did not plan to execute a like-kind exchange for any of the other fossil fuel power plants it was selling.", "VI. Identification of Like-Kind Replacement Properties and Due Diligence", "Because section 1031 has a strict timeframe for identification--on or before the 45th day after the date on which the relinquished property is transferred--and acquisition of replacement property--within 180 days of the date on which the relinquished property is transferred (or, if earlier, the transferor's tax return due date for the year in which the transfer of the relinquished property occurs)--Unicom started looking for potential replacement properties before the closing of the sale under the EME agreement.", "By November 1999 PwC had identified 26 prospective lessees. Unicom did not participate in the initial identification process.", "On or about November 9-10, 1999, PwC, on behalf of Unicom, sent proposals to a number of potential lessees for the sale-leaseback portion of the like-kind exchange.", "PwC contacted both taxable and tax-exempt entities.

State court to obtain a declaratory judgment on the continued validity of certain covenants in its outstanding public securities issued for the purpose of financing the construction and improvement of its electric and gas systems, which included the Spruce station.", "The City of San Antonio represented in the petition that the encumbrance would be limited to the value of the private company's (Unicom's) \"future right to obtain a possessory leasehold interest in the [f]acility (a) after the 30-year lease back to the City has expired and (b) if the City elects not to exercise its right to cancel the [headlease] after the 30-year lease back to the City has expired.\"", "In the initial draft of the petition, the City also represented that it intended to exercise the cancellation option.", "However, this statement was later deleted at the suggestion of Winston & Strawn and PwC, who reviewed the petition on behalf of Unicom and provided comments.", "The City of San Antonio represented in its petition that it retained fee ownership in the Spruce station and retained possession and rights to operate it during the leaseback term.", "The City of San Antonio also represented that all the rent would be prepaid six months after the closing date on the leaseback transaction and that the City of San Antonio would make an investment that upon maturity would provide the amounts necessary to pay for the cancellation option.", "The City estimated that the net present value of the rights which Unicom would acquire in the future was approximately $40 million.", "On June 2, 2000, the City of San Antonio, acting by and through CPS, entered into a sale-leaseback transaction with Unicom, through UII and its wholly owned subsidiaries, Spruce Equity Holdings, L.P., and Spruce Holdings Trust, with respect to the Spruce station.", "In essence, the money transferred by Unicom to CPS was to be split in three funds: the first fund would be returned to Unicom as a prepayment of sublease by CPS, the second fund would be set aside for investment that would secure the payment of the cancellation option should CPS decide not to reacquire the Spruce station at the end of the sublease, and the third fund would be retained by CPS and could be used for its current needs.", "Pursuant to the headlease agreement for the Spruce transaction (Spruce headlease), CPS leased the Spruce station to Unicom for a term of 65 years, starting June 2, 2000, and terminating on June 2, 2065 (Spruce headlease term), unless terminated earlier.", "The Spruce headlease term exceeded the Spruce station's estimated remaining useful life of 52 years, as determined in the Deloitte appraisal report dated June 2, 2000 (Spruce appraisal).", "Since the headlease term exceeded the plant's remaining useful life, the transaction could qualify as a sale, making it a SILO, not a LILO.", "Under the Spruce headlease, Unicom agreed to pay $725 million to CPS on the closing date, June 2, 2000 (Spruce headlease rent).", "This amount was equal to the estimated fair market value of the Spruce station on the closing date according to the Spruce appraisal prepared by Deloitte.", "The appraised fair market value served as the basis for determining Unicom's investment in the transaction, and the parties did not further negotiate the investment amount.", "Deloitte estimated that as of the end of the Spruce sublease in 2032 the fair market value of the Spruce station would be $626 million if based on the discounted cashflow analysis ($609.6 million if based on the cost approach).", "Under the Spruce sublease agreement (Spruce sublease), CPS leased back from Unicom all of Unicom's right, title, and interest in the Spruce station under the Spruce headlease.", "The sublease term commenced on June 2, 2000, and was scheduled to terminate on March 2, 2032, for a term of 31.75 years.", "Under the Spruce sublease, CPS was obligated to prepay rent to Unicom for the entire sublease term in the amount of $557,329,539 on November 30, 2000 (Spruce base rent).", "The Spruce base rent accrued and was allocated annually pro rata, commencing on the first day of the sublease term.", "If the Spruce sublease terminated early, Unicom was required to return to CPS any unaccrued base rent.", "The Spruce sublease was a net lease, requiring CPS to pay all costs and expenses in connection with the Spruce station.", "In addition, CPS was required to maintain insurance on the Spruce station under the terms of the sublease.", "The parties to the Spruce transaction agreed that the Spruce headlease could not be terminated or extinguished by any circumstances of any character or for any reason, with certain limited exceptions including CPS' defaulting under the Spruce sublease terms.", "The Spruce sublease provided for early termination if CPS were to default under the terms of the sublease.", "The events of default included, among other provisions, failure to pay the Spruce base rent, failure of any material representation or warranty made by CPS, or failure to properly maintain the Spruce station.", "In case there was significant damage to the Spruce station so as to render the station beyond repair, CPS could elect to either replace the Spruce station or terminate the Spruce sublease.", "In any of these scenarios, Unicom had a number of remedies against CPS, including collecting the stipulated loss value of the Spruce sublease, and taking possession of the Spruce station to operate, sell, or sublease it to somebody else.", "The stipulated loss value was predetermined on the closing date and based on the Deloitte Spruce appraisal and was meant to ensure Unicom's return on the investment.", "Under the Spruce headlease, Unicom had the right to use, operate, and possess the Spruce station without interference from CPS.", "Unicom did not have any obligations to CPS in respect of maintenance, operation, or insurance of the Spruce station under the headlease.", "Upon the Spruce headlease expiration, Unicom could return the Spruce station to CPS. Unicom was not obligated to make any representations or warranties with respect to the Spruce station except that it was free and clear of liens in case CPS decided to exercise its cancellation option at the end of the Spruce sublease term.", "The Spruce sublease was a triple-net lease, meaning that CPS was responsible for all the costs and expenses, foreseen or unforeseen, in connection with the Spruce station, including costs of operation, maintenance, insurance, improvements and other expenses.", "The Spruce sublease contained a covenant of quiet enjoyment in favor of CPS unless it defaulted under the sublease.", "CPS could, at its own expense, use, operate, service, repair, and maintain the property as long as it complied with the industry standards and applicable laws and did not have a material adverse effect on the Spruce station, did not result in risk of criminal liability, and did not involve any material risk of loss, forfeiture, or sale of the Spruce station.", "CPS was solely responsible for environmental compliance and any necessary remedial measures. CPS was also responsible for obtaining and maintaining property and liability insurance coverage meeting certain requirements set out in the Spruce sublease agreement.", "Unicom's rights under the Spruce sublease were very limited. Unicom had the right to inspect the Spruce station no more than once a year.", "CPS was required to seek Unicom's consent with respect to proposed improvements, corporate consolidations, subleases, and assignments.", "CPS had limited rights to encumber the property throughout the Spruce sublease term, and could not create any liens on the property after the Spruce sublease term expiration.", "Unicom, on the other hand, could incur liens on the property after the termination of the Spruce sublease, provided that CPS did not exercise its cancellation option.", "CPS took the Spruce station from Unicom on an as-is basis. However, at the end of the Spruce sublease term CPS was required to return the Spruce station in good working order and meeting the predetermined minimum operational standards.", "For example, the Spruce Station was required to have an annual ratio of the actual net generation to the normal claimed capacity operating for 8,760 hours/year of at least 82.0%.", "The Spruce station was required to have the ratio of available generation to maximum generation of at least 89% and have an annual ratio of the heat energy output of not more than 10,950 Btu/kWh.", "These conditions applied to the return of the Spruce station at the end of the Spruce sublease term in 2032 as well.", "If CPS decided to return the station to Unicom at the end of the sublease, CPS was required to arrange at its own expense for any necessary permits for Unicom to operate the Spruce station and for engineering and environmental inspections, as well as to arrange for Unicom fuel supply contracts and transmission agreements, together with other agreements necessary to operate the station.", "Failure to comply with these requirements would trigger a CPS default under the agreement, and Unicom could pursue its contractual remedies.", "Unicom paid $725 million to CPS under the Spruce headlease on June 2, 2000. Of that amount, CPS retained a lump sum of approximately $88 million, of which the City of San Antonio received about $12.3 million.", "On the same date, CPS entered into the collateralized payment undertaking agreement (CPUA) with AIG Financial Products (Jersey), Limited (AIG-FP).", "Under the CPUA, CPS would pay AIG-FP a fee of $88,995,790 (undertaking fee). In exchange, AIG-FP would use the proceeds from the undertaking fee to make payments to Unicom, for the benefit of CPS, at the end of the Spruce sublease term in the amounts and on the dates specified in the CPUA.", "In essence, the payments matched both in timing and amount the amounts CPS would owe to Unicom upon CPS' exercise of the fixed purchase option (cancellation option) available to CPS at the end of the Spruce sublease term.", "The cancellation option allowed CPS to terminate the Spruce headlease at the end of the Spruce sublease term and completely regain the ownership of the station.", "CPS' payment to AIG-FP of the undertaking fee was absolute, unconditional, irrevocable, and not refundable to CPS under any circumstances, including CPS' bankruptcy.", "CPS did not have any rights or interest in any portion of the undertaking fee, and the fee could not be subject to any lien, claim, or remedy by CPS or its creditors.", "After the payment, the undertaking fee ceased to be an asset of CPS and became an asset of AIG-FP.", "The CPUA required AIG-FP to deliver the cash received as the undertaking fee to Wilmington Trust Co. to be held as collateral pledged primarily to Unicom until CPS paid its obligations under the various transaction agreements.", "In the event of an early termination of the Spruce sublease, Unicom would receive a \"termination amount\" under the terms of the CPUA from the undertaking fee proceeds.", "As additional protection of Unicom's interest in the amounts set aside under the CPUA, American International Group, Inc. (AIG), guaranteed the obligations of AIG-FP under the CPUA.", "CPS also obtained a financial guaranty insurance policy from Financial Security Assurance (FSA). Specifically, the policy provided certain protections to CPS in case of its bankruptcy or in the event of CPS' default or early termination of the sublease.", "Further, from the Spruce headlease rent, CPS transferred the following amounts to secure the Spruce sublease base rent due on November 30, 2000:", "(1) about $327.3 million to Wilmington Trust Co. as custodian of an account that would be pledged to Unicom;", "(2) about $50 million to an account pledged to AIG Financial Products Corp. to support CPS' obligations under the letter of credit reimbursement agreement;", "(3) about $162 million to an account pledged to FSA to support CPS's obligations under the insurance and indemnity agreement to the Spruce sublease.", "Although the total amount set aside was roughly $539 million, some of the money was invested by the custodians in low-risk securities to provide sufficient income to cover the entire $557 million Spruce base rent.", "At the end of the Spruce sublease term, March 2, 2032, CPS would have the option of terminating the Spruce sublease and causing Unicom to terminate the Spruce headlease (cancellation option) for the price of $733,849,606.", "Because the entire amount of the cancellation option payment was financed through the CPUA, CPS would not have to contribute or borrow any additional cash.", "According to the appraisal prepared by Deloitte, the fair market value of the Spruce station on the cancellation option exercise date in 2032 would be around $626 million if based on a discounted cashflow analysis and around $609.6 million if based on a cost approach.", "If CPS chose not to exercise the cancellation option, it would trigger provisions of the Spruce sublease describing conditions for returning the Spruce station to Unicom.", "Among other things, CPS would have to ensure that the station meet operational standards, arrange for various inspections, obtain operating permits for Unicom, and arrange for Unicom to enter into fuel supply contracts, transmission agreements, and other contracts with third parties necessary to operate the Spruce station.", "Failure to comply with these requirements would trigger a default and the right of Unicom to seek contractual remedies, as discussed below.", "If CPS chose not to exercise the cancellation option at the end of the sublease term, Unicom would have three choices.", "First, Unicom could require CPS to arrange for a \"qualified operator\" to enter into an operating agreement with Unicom.", "Second, Unicom could require CPS to arrange for a \"qualified bidder\" to enter into a service agreement.", "If Unicom did not provide CPS with written notice of which option it decided to exercise, Unicom would be deemed to have exercised both the operating agreement and the service agreement options.", "Finally, Unicom could take possession of the Spruce station and could operate it and sell its energy production without exercising the operating agreement or service option.", "If Unicom exercised the service agreement or operating agreement option and CPS failed to implement the service agreement or operating agreement option by the end of the Spruce sublease, such failure would constitute an event of default and trigger the right of Unicom to pursue appropriate remedies.", "However, under certain circumstances CPS would have another opportunity to exercise the cancellation option at the same price.", "Under the operating agreement option, CPS was required to find a qualified operator for the Spruce station.", "CPS could not be the qualified operator. A qualified operator would have to, among other requirements, have its senior long-term debt rated no lower than Aa2 by Moody's and AA by S&P or have a comparable rating by another rating agency acceptable to Unicom or be deemed similarly creditworthy in the sole opinion of Unicom.", "Alternatively, a qualified operator could obtain a guaranty of its obligations under the operating agreement by any person with its senior unsecured long-term debt rated no lower than Aa2 by Moody's and AA by S&P, or have a comparable rating by another rating agency acceptable to Unicom.", "The operating agreement option contemplated that the electric output of the Spruce station would be sold to third parties under the power toll processing agreements, discussed in the next section.", "Deloitte included in its appraisal a list of potential power purchasers and operators. The only entity with an acceptable credit rating was General Electric Corp., meaning that most potential qualified operators would have to make guaranty arrangements.", "If CPS did not elect to exercise its cancellation option and Unicom elected to exercise the service agreement option, CPS was required to arrange for the submission of one or more bids from qualified bidders to enter into the power toll processing agreement with Unicom for a term of 9.58 years.", "Unicom expected the power toll processing agreement to be substantially in the form attached to the Spruce sublease agreement.", "CPS was also required to arrange for the qualified bidder to satisfy all of the conditions precedent to entering into the power toll processing agreement on or before the expiration date for the Spruce sublease.", "A qualified bidder would have to have--or have its obligations under the power toll processing agreement guaranteed by any person that had--senior unsecured long-term debt obligations rated no lower than Aa2 by Moody's and AA by S&P or have a comparable rating for its senior unsecured long-term debt obligations by another rating agency acceptable to Unicom.", "If a bidder or a guarantor did not have debt with such a rating, Unicom could determine whether the bidder or guarantor satisfied the creditworthiness requirements at its sole discretion.", "The power purchase bids would have to provide Unicom with net power revenue in the amounts and at the times set forth in the Spruce sublease.", "Unicom could reject any bid if it concluded that the bid would require the Spruce station to be operated inconsistently with the standards and operational practices and policies of operators of similar facilities in similar circumstances.", "In that event, CPS would be entitled to arrange for one or more alternative bids. If CPS were unable to find a qualified bidder or Unicom rejected all bidders on or before the Spruce sublease expiration date, CPS would have to exercise the cancellation option.", "A. MEAG and Its Decision To Enter the Scherer and Wansley Transactions", "MEAG was created by the State of Georgia to own and operate electric generation and transmission facilities and supply bulk wholesale electric power to its 49 member municipalities, 48 cities, and one county in Georgia.", "MEAG's mission is to deliver low-cost power to its participants and, with respect to its own generation plants, operate them at the lowest cost.", "MEAG sells power to its cities at cost and any profit it earns has to inure to the benefit of its cities.", "MEAG is a member of a power marketing agency called the Energy Authority, which optimizes MEAG's resources and identifies the most economical method for MEAG to supply power to its members.", "These options could entail selling output to the market from one of the power plants MEAG owns and then buying lower-cost power from a third party, or selling some of MEAG's extra capacity during colder months to Florida, North Carolina, or Alabama.", "MEAG's portfolio of assets consists primarily of investments in power plants, including undivided ownership interests in the Scherer and Wansley stations.", "Typically, MEAG issues debt to finance the construction of a power plant, capitalizing the interest during the construction, and then bills cities monthly for the debt service, the operating expenses, and the fuel expenses.", "Georgia Power Co., Oglethorpe Power Corp., and the City of Dalton are the coowners of the Scherer and Wansley Stations.", "Georgia Power Corp. operates the Scherer and Wansley Stations.", "MEAG is a governmental entity and is tax exempt. State law restricts MEAG's investments primarily to U.S. Treasuries, repurchase agreements backed by treasuries and agencies, and money market funds that have treasuries and agencies.", "In 1999 MEAG opened an account with $435 million that was intended to grow with interest until 2008 when MEAG thought deregulation would occur, but the power market in Georgia was never deregulated.", "James Fuller was MEAG's treasurer at the time the Wansley and Scherer transactions were negotiated and closed.", "Mr. Fuller led MEAG in the negotiations with petitioner and the other third parties involved in the transactions.", "During the negotiations, Mr. Fuller reviewed the transaction documents and the terms relating to the fixed price purchase option.", "Mr. Fuller also reviewed the Deloitte appraisal, but MEAG did not do an appraisal of its own. MEAG originally acquired the Wansley and Scherer stations at cost.", "Before entering into the Scherer and Wansley transactions, MEAG obtained certain consents from the coowners of the stations, Georgia Power Co., Oglethorpe Power Corp., and the City of Dalton.", "MEAG also retained R.W.

According to Dr. Skinner, here, where both CPS and MEAG are tax-exempt entities, their cashflows are about 40% higher than the cashflows Deloitte assumes, significantly increasing the value of the assets at the sublease termination dates.", "Second, Dr. Skinner concluded that Deloitte also applied too high a discount rate to these cashflows, further reducing the estimated value of the assets.", "Dr. Skinner recalculated the value of each asset using Deloitte's cashflows and applying a 0% tax rate and lower discount rates of 6.1% for Spruce and 6.3% for Wansley and Scherer.", "His calculations show an estimated value for each asset at the sublease expiration date that is substantially higher than the cancellation/purchase option exercise price.", "Thus, Dr. Skinner concluded that it was nearly certain that CPS and MEAG will exercise their respective cancellation/purchase options at the end of the sublease terms, allowing Exelon to obtain the option proceeds without ever bearing any significant risk of loss.", "In addition Dr. Skinner opined that CPS and MEAG would be economically compelled to exercise their cancellation/purchase options because of the \"onerous\" conditions they would face if they did not exercise their respective options.", "Dr. Skinner in his expert report shows that, absent tax benefits available under section 1031, Exelon would never recover its initial investment in the lease.", "Thus, Dr. Skinner concluded that Exelon would be able to generate a positive return from the transactions only because of the tax benefits.", "The Court recognized Christopher Knittel as an expert in energy and environmental economics, industrial organization, and regulation.", "Dr. Knittel is the William Barton Rogers professor of energy economics in the Sloan School of Management at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.", "He has a Ph.D. in economics from the University of California at Berkeley.

Thus, because petitioner exchanged ownership interests in power plants for financial instruments (low-risk loans), petitioner failed to meet section 1031 like-kind exchange requirements.", "Further, respondent argues that because the substance of each test transaction is a loan rather than a lease, these loans should generate original issue discount (OID) income under section 1272.", "According to respondent, petitioner is not entitled to depreciation deductions under section 168, interest deductions under section 467, or transaction cost deductions under section 162.", "In the alternative, respondent argues that the test transactions lack economic substance because they were driven by tax considerations and the desire to defer taxation of a $1.6 billion gain, not by a legitimate business purpose.", "Accordingly, respondent urges the Court to disregard the test transactions altogether and conclude that petitioner failed to enter into a like-kind exchange.", "Respondent maintains that petitioner never expected to realize pretax benefits from the test transactions alone.", "However, together with the tax deferral benefits available under section 1031, petitioner would be able to more than make up for the economic losses associated with the test transactions.", "Further, respondent argues that petitioner is also liable for accuracy-related penalties under section 6662 for both tax years, 1999 and 2001, for negligently engaging in transactions that it should have known were \"too good to be true\".", "According to respondent, petitioner's tax reporting also resulted in a substantial understatement of income tax for the 1999 tax year.", "We have discussed in detail the seminal cases and regulations related to leveraged leases, LILOs, and SILOs in this Court's opinion in John Hancock Life Ins.

United States, 435 U.S. 561 (1978), is the seminal Supreme Court case discussing leveraged lease transactions.", "The taxpayer in Frank Lyon engaged in a sale-leaseback transaction to finance the construction of a new building.", "Out of the required $7.64 million, Frank Lyon invested $500,000 of its own money and financed the remainder with a third-party lender through a secured mortgage with the building serving as a collateral.", "In addition, Frank Lyon made a promise to assume personal responsibility for the loan's repayment and an assignment to the lender of the rental payments under the lease.", "The lease in Frank Lyon was a net lease requiring lessee to pay taxes, insurance, and utilities. Lessee had an option to purchase the building at certain times during the lease and at the end of the 25-year lease term.", "Lessee also had an option to renew the lease for additional periods of time. Frank Lyon claimed depreciation deductions and interest expense deductions related to the building.", "After considering the transaction, the Supreme Court held that the form of a sale-leaseback transaction will be respected for Federal tax purposes as long as the lessor retains significant and genuine attributes of a traditional lessor.", "Id. at 584. The Supreme Court recognized that these attributes necessarily depend on the facts of a particular case.", "Id. According to the Supreme Court, several factors weighed in favor of the taxpayer in Frank Lyon. Frank Lyon bore the financial risks of the transaction by assuming responsibility for loan repayment and investing its own money in the transaction.", "Id. at 581. The Supreme Court concluded that there was a real possibility that the lessor could walk away from the transaction at the end of the initial lease.", "The parties negotiated the deal in good faith and were independent of each other. The parties paid the same tax rates, making the transaction tax neutral.", "The rent and purchase option prices were reasonable, and Frank Lyon assumed the credit risk of the lessee's defaulting on its rent payments.", "Around the time the Supreme Court issued its ruling in Frank Lyon, the Government was working on developing a set of rules to determine whether a leveraged lease transaction is a true lease or something else.", "In 1975 the Commissioner issued guidelines for advance ruling purposes on whether a leveraged lease will be respected for Federal tax purposes as a lease.", "Rev. Proc. 75-21, 1975-1 C.B. 715.

L. No. 98-369, sec. 31, 98 Stat. at 509.", "The unintended consequence of the Pickle rule was the proliferation of LILO transactions with tax-exempt entities.", "LILO transactions were designed to work around the Pickle rule because the taxable party leased the property from the tax-exempt counterparty instead of buying it, and then immediately subleased it back to the tax-exempt entity.", "To fund the transaction, the taxable party typically took out a nonrecourse loan covering 80%-90% of the initial lease.", "See John Hancock Life Ins. Co. (U.S.A.) v. Commissioner, 141 T.C. at 11.", "The sublease to a tax-exempt entity would typically be shorter than the initial lease term. At the end of the sublease, the tax-exempt entity usually has the option to purchase the remainder of the leasehold interest in the initial lease.", "Even if the tax-exempt entity decides not to exercise its purchase option, the taxable party could still compel the tax-exempt entity to renew the sublease, take possession of the asset, or procure the replacement sublease.", "To return the asset to the taxable party, the tax-exempt entity would typically need to meet certain conditions, including refinancing the nonrecourse loan involved in the transactions.", "Failure to meet the return conditions meant that the tax-exempt entity had to exercise the purchase option.", "In 1999 LILO transactions became less popular because of a change in the regulations under section 467, which required that prepayment of the initial lease rent be treated as a loan for tax purposes.", "Id. at 16; see also sec. 1.467-4, Income Tax Regs. After that, investors started using SILOs to obtain similar results.", "See John Hancock Life Ins. Co. (U.S.A.) v.

The end-of-sublease options for the taxable entity usually include either compelling the lessee to arrange a service contract for the asset for a predetermined term or to take possession of the asset.", "The payments in SILO and LILO transactions are typically secured by the various defeasance instruments.", "Although the form of such instruments differs from one transaction to another, typically they entail setting aside several deposits with third-party financial institutions--payment undertakers--for various payments due under the transaction documents, including purchase options.", "Id. at 12. As a result of defeasance, the parties to the transaction do not have to come up with any out-of-pocket payments during the initial lease term.", "In 2002 the Commissioner issued Rev. Rul. 2002-69, 2002-2 C.B. 760, which explained that LILO transactions should be properly characterized as a future interest in property.", "Consequently, a taxpayer may not deduct rent or interest paid or incurred in connection with such a transaction.", "In the ruling the Commissioner stated that he would challenge tax benefit claims based on LILO transactions under the substance over form and economic substance doctrines.", "Congress eliminated the benefits associated with LILO and SILO transactions in the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004, Pub.", "L.

The inquiry into the likelihood of purchase option exercise is determinative because if the original property holder is reasonably expected to exercise the purchase option at the end of the sublease, the obligations of the parties under SILO/LILO would offset each other, so that a taxpayer would be insulated from any economic risk of loss and would not be able to take advantage of any potential gain.", "Id. at 94. Instead, a taxpayer would be guaranteed a fixed return on its investment at the end of a sublease term.", "This would indicate that the taxpayer did not obtain any benefits or burdens associated with the leasehold or ownership interest transferred in a SILO/LILO.", "For the LILO transactions in John Hancock, the Court concluded that \"any legal, political, industrial, or technical objections to the nonexercise of the purchase options can be overcome, and thus are not determinative of whether [the LILO counterparty] is reasonably likely to exercise its purchase option.\"", "John Hancock Life Ins.

The Court came to the same conclusion for one of the SILO transactions, the SNCB SILO.", "Id. at 145. Thus, the Court held that the substance of all the LILO and SNCB SILO transactions was inconsistent with their form and that these transactions resembled loans because John Hancock did not acquire genuine attributes of ownership or leasehold interest.", "Id. at 109-110, 145. As a result, the Court held that John Hancock was not entitled to rental expense and depreciation deductions related to these transactions.", "Id. at 109-110, 145. The Court also disallowed the interest expense for the nonrecourse loans John Hancock took out to finance the transactions.", "Id. at 146-147. Further, the Court recharacterized the equity contributions into these transactions as a loan giving rise to the original issue discount (OID) income.", "Id. at 148. The Court held that pursuant to section 1.1273-2(g)(4), Income Tax Regs., John Hancock's transaction costs with respect to LILOs and the SNCB SILO must be included as an additional amount lent to borrowers and are not deductible under section 162.", "For the remaining SILO transactions, the Court concluded, after considering financial analyses presented by the parties and various nonfinancial constraints, that exercising the purchase option at the end of the sublease was not the only financially viable alternative for the SILO counterparties.", "Id. at 123, 131-132. According to the appraisals, the projected fair market value of the assets involved in the remaining SILOs was going to be substantially lower than the purchase option exercise price.", "Id. at 114-115, 123-124. Thus, the Court assumed that these options would not be exercised and proceeded with the analysis of whether John Hancock had any economic risk after the end of the sublease and until the end of the lease.", "The Court then concluded that John Hancock indeed faced economic risks indicative of ownership during that period under the service contract option because any payments under that option were not guaranteed.", "Id. at 132-135. Thus, the Commissioner did not succeed with the substance-over-form argument for these remaining transactions.", "With respect to the remaining SILO transactions, the Court held that John Hancock acquired a future interest in the transferred assets and was thus not entitled to depreciation deductions before the purchase option exercise date.", "John Hancock Ins. Co. (U.S.A.) v. Commissioner, 141 T.C. at 137. Because John Hancock had only future interest in the assets, the Court disallowed any interest deductions as well.", "Id. at 147.

Co. (U.S.A.) v. Commissioner, 141 T.C. at 111-137, where this Court concluded that because exercising the purchase option at the end of the sublease was not the only economically viable option for the original property owners and John Hancock was exposed to more than de minimis risk after the end of the sublease period, John Hancock acquired a future ownership interest in the underlying properties.", "Petitioner advances several arguments to support its contention that it indeed had acquired benefits and burdens of ownership during the sublease term.", "First, petitioner maintains that it made a meaningful equity contribution to acquire the leases. Unlike parties in traditional LILO/SILO transactions, petitioner did not use any loans to pay the Spruce headlease rent.", "Instead, it paid with the proceeds of a recent sale of its own power plant. CPS returned only 76.9% of the headlease rent to prepay the rent during the Spruce sublease term.", "Petitioner argues that the 23.1% CPS retained after prepayment of the Spruce sublease rent satisfies any equity tests derived from judicial decisions and administrative guidance.", "Second, petitioner maintains that the rights and obligations conveyed by the Spruce headlease and sublease agreements are typical of traditional leases and significantly alter the rights of the parties.", "Specifically, petitioner cites the necessity for CPS to obtain consent for improvements that could have a material impact on the value of the subleased property.", "Third, petitioner points to its extensive due diligence efforts as indicative of obtaining a true ownership interest in the Spruce station.", "Finally, petitioner claims that it was exposed to a significant risk of loss in case of CPS' bankruptcy and sublease rejection because of the limitations of section 502(b)(6) of the Bankruptcy Code.", "We begin with an observation that what made SILO and LILO transactions abusive was not only the amount of equity invested by the parties entering into such transactions but rather the circular flow of money such transactions created.", "As the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit explained in Wells Fargo, 641 F.3d at 1330:", "[W]e are left with purely circular transactions that elevate form over substance. The only flow of funds between the parties to the transaction was the initial lump sum given to the tax-exempt entity as compensation for its participation in the transaction.", "From the tax-exempt entity's point of view, the transaction effectively ended as soon as it began. The benefits to Wells Fargo continued to flow throughout the term of the sublease, however, in the form of deferred tax payments.", "The third-party lender and its affiliate were also compensated for their participation, as were the creators and promoters of the transactions.", "These transactions were win-win situations for all of the parties involved because free money--in the form of previously unavailable tax benefits utilized by Wells Fargo--was divided among all parties.", "The money was not entirely \"free,\" of course, because it was in effect transferred to Wells Fargo from the public fisc.", "Here, the funds necessary to fund the headlease rent came from the untaxed proceeds of the Collins power plant sale by petitioner.", "In addition to attempting to reap the benefits of long-term tax deferral under the section 1031 rules for like- kind exchanges, petitioner claimed various tax deductions associated with its participation in the Spruce, Scherer, and Wansley transactions.", "Unlike the taxpayer in Frank Lyon, which entered into a sale-leaseback with another taxable entity such that the transaction was tax neutral as a result, petitioner entered into a transaction with a tax-exempt entity.", "This would allow petitioner to double-dip into the tax benefits by deferring the tax under section 1031 and using deductions related to the test transactions.", "The structure of the cashflows in the Spruce transaction guaranteed the return of 76.9% of petitioner's initial investment just six months after the closing date in the form of rent prepayment under the Spruce sublease.", "During that period, CPS obtained credit enhancements to secure the payment of the rent. The rest of petitioner's investment was either used to pay the accommodation fee to CPS in the form of the NPV benefit or set aside pursuant to the Spruce CPUA to secure the payments of the stipulated loss value during the period of the Spruce sublease or the payment of the purchase option price at the end of the sublease.", "CPS obtained credit enhancement and insurance for the CPUA from AIG, and the interest rate risk was also insured.", "Thus, similarly to traditional SILOs or LILOs, the Spruce transaction created a circular flow of money accompanied by a transfer of tax benefits from a tax-exempt to a taxable entity.", "See Wells Fargo, 641 F.3d at 1330. In addition, the terms of the Spruce transaction ensured that only six months into the deal petitioner would be in the same cash position as if it had taken out a loan to finance the transaction, similar to traditional SILOs and LILOs.", "In effect, CPS did not have any control over petitioner's investment after the closing of the transaction with the exception of the NPV benefit, which was CPS' reward for entering into the Spruce transaction.", "Accordingly, we are not persuaded by petitioner's argument that a 100% upfront out-of-pocket investment precludes the finding that any of the test transactions were abusive.", "We also disagree with petitioner's argument that the Spruce headlease or sublease somehow significantly altered the parties' rights and obligations with respect to the Spruce station.", "Under the Spruce headlease, petitioner did not have any obligations to CPS in respect of the maintenance, operation, or insurance of the Spruce station during the sublease term or the remainder of the headlease.", "If petitioner were to return the Spruce station to CPS at the end of the headlease or if the headlease was terminated, it was not required to meet any return conditions except making sure the Spruce station was free from petitioner's liens.", "Under the terms of the Spruce sublease, CPS accepted all the risks related to the operation of the Spruce station throughout the sublease term.", "CPS also agreed to observe certain maintenance and operating standards, subleasing restrictions, assignment rights, restrictions and requirements pertaining to alterations and modifications, environmental compliance, and minimum insurance coverage.", "These restrictions were designed to insulate petitioner's risk during the sublease term and ensure that in the worst case scenario--if CPS does not exercise its cancellation option at the end of the sublease--the Spruce station would be in good working condition.", "In short, CPS merely agreed to operate the station during the sublease term in the same manner a reasonable owner would.", "Similar to John Hancock, there is no evidence that before the closing date CPS was not already adhering to the same operating, maintenance, or environmental standards.", "See John Hancock Life Ins. Co. (U.S.A.) v. Commissioner, 141 T.C. at 113. Petitioner's expert Prof. McDermott also concluded that the contractual terms of the test transactions mitigated many risks of ownership, including technological obsolescence, failure of utility assets, long-term market value changes, failure of payments, and changes in Government or regulatory requirements.", "With respect to sublease and assignment restrictions, CPS could always ask petitioner for consent, the same as for improvements that could materially affect the value of the leased property.", "In fact, in 2004, when CPS decided to build Spruce II, which would share the site and some facilities with the Spruce station, petitioner gave its consent after a short site visit and receipt of a written confirmation from CPS that the construction was not going to affect the Spruce station value.", "Petitioner did not bother to visit the site after Spruce II was finally completed and started to work.", "Next, we do not find that petitioner's own due diligence efforts are indicative of any ownership rights.", "Respondent points out that petitioner had to complete the due diligence process within the strict time limits imposed by section 1031.", "As a result, petitioner did not follow up on certain red flags raised in engineering reports. Moreover, Mr. Roling and others in petitioner's tax department only cursorily reviewed the tax opinion packages prepared by Winston & Strawn.", "Mr. Berdelle, who testified that he read the entire Winston & Strawn tax opinion, did not act on or inquire about inconsistencies therein of which petitioner was, or should have been, aware.", "In most prior SILO/LILO cases taxpayers also engaged in extensive due diligence before to entering into the transactions, including hiring prominent law firms to draft documents, accounting firms to structure transactions and provide appraisals, and engineering firms to evaluate the properties.", "See, e.g., ConEd I, 90 Fed. Cl. at 234-235. That nonetheless did not prevent the courts in those cases from holding that the substance of such transactions was inconsistent with their form and that the taxpayers did not obtain genuine attributes of ownership.", "See, e.g., ConEd II, 703 F.3d at 1378-1379, 1381 (discussing the appraisal prepared by Deloitte and concluding that it was insufficient to support the taxpayer's contentions and was boilerplate; holding that the taxpayer failed to obtain genuine attributes of ownership to support the claimed deductions).", "Finally, petitioner argues that it faced a substantial risk of loss in the event of CPS bankruptcy despite the available credit enhancements.", "Petitioner attempts to distinguish these cases from the SILO and LILO transactions in John Hancock on this ground because in John Hancock none of the tax-exempt counterparties were subject to the limitations stated in section 502(b)(6) of the Bankruptcy Code.", "Respondent maintains that this risk was illusory and petitioner would be able to recover its investment even if section 502(b)(6) of the Bankruptcy Code limited the recovery available through the bankruptcy proceedings.", "Sec. 502(b)(6) of the Bankruptcy Code limits a lessor's claim for liquidated damages in bankruptcy resulting from the termination of a lease of real property to an amount not to exceed three years' rent plus any unpaid rent due under the lease at the time a debtor files its bankruptcy petition.", "We agree with respondent. Petitioner's claim is inconsistent with the record and is a mere attempt to blow out of proportion the risk of loss in the event of CPS' bankruptcy.", "First, according to FCLC, petitioner's credit adviser, CPS was generally very creditworthy. FCLC opined that the payment obligations and associated risks had been effectively identified and supported by credit enhancements so even in the case of CPS' bankruptcy petitioner would be able to fully recover its investments from the credit enhancement providers.", "In 2000 CPS had one of the highest credit ratings in the country, and had cash on hand of over $450 million and a reserve fund surety policy in excess of $225 million.", "The City of San Antonio itself would have to file for bankruptcy before CPS became bankrupt. As of 2000 there had never been a failure of a major municipality in the history of the State of Texas.", "PwC explained that there was \"bulletproof assurance\" to Unicom that there was no practical exposure to loss during the first nine months of the CPS transaction, and that CPS' going bankrupt within the first six months of the transaction was commercially impossible.", "In addition, CPS obtained sufficient credit enhancements to secure the risk of rent nonpayment or early sublease termination.", "We find that petitioner's speculations on what might happen if CPS filed for bankruptcy do not add anything of substance to our analysis.", "No transaction is absolutely protected from all possible risks, including catastrophic economic events or destruction of property \"by a biblical flood or a superbolide meteor\".", "UnionBanCal Corp., 113 Fed. Cl. at 135. The record here supports respondent's argument that petitioner faced a risk of loss only in such a catastrophic event.", "We do not consider this risk sufficient to hold that petitioner had genuine attributes of ownership during the Spruce sublease term.", "Petitioner's own expert Mr. McDermott stated in his expert report that the bankruptcy of a municipal utility is a relatively low-probability event but has occurred in other jurisdictions.", "We also find that petitioner was sufficiently protected from the risk of economic loss if the Spruce sublease terminated early.", "The sublease agreement contained provisions that guaranteed that petitioner would receive stipulated loss value payments in the event of CPS' default.", "These payments were predetermined and set forth in a schedule to the Spruce sublease agreement. The payments would be made out of the funds set aside at the closing date pursuant to the CPUA.", "Petitioner argues that in case of an early Spruce sublease termination petitioner would have to return any unaccrued prepaid rent to CPS.", "This argument ignores the fact that after netting the unaccrued prepaid rent and the stipulated loss value, petitioner would still recover its full investment in the lease, including transaction fees and interest through the time of default.", "As Mr. Berdelle explained in a memorandum prepared for the Unicom board meeting on April 4, 2000, requesting the approval of the like-kind exchange plan,", "[t]he stipulated loss values also include additional earnings protection of about $3 million per each $100 million of initial investment.", "example, if there was a default on both the MEAG and CPS transactions (about $1.6 billion), Unicom would receive its investment and about $48 million pretax income in the year of default as earnings protection.", "The Spruce transaction documents were drafted to reflect this understanding. We are thus satisfied that petitioner did not face any significant risks indicative of genuine ownership during the Spruce sublease term.", "We next consider whether petitioner acquired the benefits and burdens of ownership in the light of the options available to petitioner and CPS at the end of the Spruce sublease period.", "First, we decide whether CPS was reasonably expected to exercise its cancellation option at the end of the Spruce sublease period.", "If it was, petitioner's profit was fixed at the outset of the Spruce transaction and petitioner did not acquire any benefits and burdens of ownership with respect to the Spruce station.", "See John Hancock Life Ins. Co. (U.S.A.) v. Commissioner, 141 T.C. at 139-143.", "Petitioner relies primarily on the Deloitte Spruce appraisal to show that CPS was not \"economically compelled\" to exercise the cancellation option at the end of the Spruce sublease.", "This is so, as petitioner sees it, because the cancellation option price was set above the expected future fair market value of the Spruce plant at the end of the Spruce sublease term.", "To support the Deloitte appraisal findings, petitioner invited several experts to submit expert reports and testify during the trial.", "Respondent relies primarily on the analyses of Dr. Skinner to argue that because CPS is a tax-exempt entity, it valued the Spruce station at a much higher level.", "Dr. Skinner asserts that there are a number of flaws with the Deloitte appraisal, including the very high corporate income tax rate and discount rate.", "Dr. Skinner suggested that because CPS was a tax-exempt entity, it would be more appropriate to use a 0% corporate income tax rate and a discount rate equal to CPS' weighted average cost of capital, about 6.1%.", "This would result in a much higher projected value for the Spruce plant at the expiration of the sublease.", "Dr. Skinner explained that because CPS did not pay dividends to its shareholders, the appropriate weighted average cost of capital should be based on the interest CPS usually paid on its bonds.", "At the beginning of our analysis, we specify what constitutes \"reasonable likelihood\" that a purchase option will be exercised at the end of the sublease period.", "We reiterate that this Court does not require an \"inevitable\", \"economically compelled\", or similar threshold for purchase option exercise likelihood in evaluating SILO/LILO transactions.", "See id. at 95-97.

United States, 113 Fed.", "Petitioner asserts that the Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit compared the option exercise price to the anticipated fair market value of the leased assets expected as of the closing of the lease in determining whether a transaction constitutes a true lease.", "See, e.g., In re Marhoefer Packing Co., Inc., 674 F.2d 1139, 1144-1145 (7th Cir. 1982) (considering whether option price was \"nominal\" in comparison to the fair market value of leased assets at the time the option could be exercised \"as anticipated by the parties when the lease *", "* * [was] signed,\" for purposes of determining whether the lease should be recharacterized as a security interest); M & W Gear Co. v.

These cases lead petitioner to assert that \"the appropriate standard for analyzing a lessee's purchase option must focus on objective economic realities and whether those realities compel exercise or strongly favor exercise to a degree of certainty.\"", "We do not find that the cases petitioner cites establish a legal standard incompatible with this Court's analysis in John Hancock and require economic compulsion or circumstances that \"strongly favor exercise to a degree of certainty.\"", "In M & W Gear Co. v. Commissioner, 446 F.2d at 844-845 (discussing in detail evidence regarding the intent of the parties), the Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit considered not only the comparable sale prices for the leased assets, but the intent of the parties at the time of entering the transaction.", "In In re Marhoefer Packing Co., Inc., 674 F.2d at 1141, the same Court of Appeals discussed only the issue of whether a specific lease in question with a $1 purchase option qualified as a true lease or a security under the provisions of the Uniform Commercial Code.", "This discussion is not pertinent here because it does not pertain to any tax law issues. Finally, none of the cases petitioner cites involve a lease supported by defeasance arrangements where both a lessee and a lessor would have certain options at the end of the lease and where the lessee would have some obligations under options available to the lessor.", "Thus, we will follow the legal standard of \"reasonable likelihood\" that this Court has adopted in John Hancock following the Courts of Appeals for the Second Circuit and the Federal Circuit.", "As to comparing the option exercise price to the estimated future value of the asset in the context of SILO/LILO transactions, this Court previously explained in John Hancock Life Ins.

Petitioner suggests that this should be the end of the analysis because a reasonable person acting in its best economic interest would not overpay over a hundred million dollars for an asset when it can easily replace the asset on the market.", "We note that the Spruce transaction was terminated pursuant to the agreement of the parties in 2014. Exelon received an additional $335 million as the stipulated loss value payment from the CPUA proceeds, and CPS received $1 million.", "The record does not state the reason for termination.", "The value would be $609,600,000 using a cost approach.

According to petitioner, Deloitte's appraisal team was known for its expertise and experience in the appraisal field.", "There was no reason for concern that Deloitte was unaware of the existing guidance on characterization of leases for Federal tax purposes.", "We see Winston & Strawn's letter dated December 29, 1999, informing the Deloitte team of the conclusions the law firm needed to see in order to issue an opinion at the requisite level as an attempt to obtain certain results.", "Our finding is supported by a pattern of communications between Winston & Strawn and Deloitte where Winston & Strawn provided regular feedback at all stages of the project, starting with Deloitte's engagement letter.", "Petitioner asserts, and Deloitte's representative, Mr. Ellsworth, testified on this point at trial, that Deloitte arrived at the fair market value of the assets at issue independently.", "Nonetheless, even if that is true, Deloitte also performed the appraisal of the relinquished power plants, Powerton and Collins.", "Deloitte therefore was aware of the amount of untaxed gain petitioner was looking to defer. This further undermines the reliability of the appraisal reports Deloitte provided for all test transactions.", "Further, in analyzing the likelihood of cancellation option exercise by CPS, Deloitte failed to consider the costs of a potential subsidy CPS would have to pay to a qualified bidder or operator to entice such a bidder/operator to enter into an operating agreement or PTPA with petitioner if the energy industry does not fare as well as expected.", "Prof. Myers, however, considered such costs and concluded that in most cases CPS would still be better off taking the money and returning the Spruce station to petitioner.", "As to the likelihood of the cancellation option's exercise, it is unhelpful to petitioner's argument that Deloitte failed to consider the costs that CPS would have to incur to bring the Spruce plant to the required (per the Spruce sublease agreement) minimum operation standards for estimated annual capacity, net energy output, and efficiency.", "Meeting these requirements is a prerequisite for CPS to return the Spruce station to Exelon at the end of the sublease term.", "According to the Spruce sublease agreement, if CPS were to fail to deliver the Spruce station meeting the minimum operating and efficiency requirements, it would have to pay the diminution of fair market value or will be given another chance to exercise the cancellation option.", "Prof. Myers also failed to take these costs into consideration in his analysis.", "Thus, the price of failing to exercise the cancellation option for CPS would consist of (1) undertaking investments required to bring the Spruce station into compliance with the minimum operating standards and other return requirements; (2) securing a replacement property or source of electricity and related costs; and (3) potential subsidies to qualified bidders and transaction costs should Exelon decide to exercise the operating agreement or the service agreement options.", "To be more specific, CPS and petitioner agreed that if CPS decided to return the Spruce station at any time during the sublease or at the end of the sublease term in 2032, the Spruce station was required, at a minimum, to have an annual ratio of the actual net generation to the normal claimed capacity of at least 82% (capacity factor), operating for 8,760 hours per year.", "The Spruce station was also required to have the ratio of available generation to maximum generation of at least 89% and have an annual ratio of the heat energy output of not more than 10,950 Btu/kWh.", "Deloitte and Prof. Myers, however, used significantly lower capacity factors in their computations. These figures were based on Deloitte's due diligence of the Spruce station and the engineering reports provided by Stone & Webster.", "Both Deloitte and Prof. Myers assumed the plant capacity factor to be 90.3% in 2000, with gradual decline to 58.7% in 2032 (the end of the sublease term) and to 49.6% in 2052 (end of the Spruce headlease).", "These numbers, according to Prof. Myers, reflected the gradual obsolescence of the plant.", "Discounted cashflow analysis performed by Deloitte and Prof. Myers incorporated the plant capacity factor and the hours of operation to determine the cashflows from the Spruce plant and determine its value in 2032.", "This \"real Spruce plant\", however, was not what petitioner was entitled to receive at the end of the Spruce sublease period.", "Petitioner was entitled to receive, because CPS had agreed to deliver, a plant that would operate in 2032 at a plant capacity factor 23% greater than anticipated by petitioner's experts.", "This \"hypothetical Spruce plant\" would, therefore, generate a much higher revenue stream and would have a value significantly higher than the value projected by Deloitte and Prof. Myers.", "According to the Deloitte appraisal, the plant capacity factor for Spruce would go down to 72.2% by year 16 of the sublease, with the available hours of operation going down to 6,325.", "Deloitte estimated that the Spruce plant would operate at these levels up to year 30 of the sublease, and at year 31 of the sublease the Spruce plant capacity would be at 58.7%, with hours of operation at 5,139 per year.", "If the Spruce plant continued to operate throughout the term of the sublease at a minimum return requirements level (82% capacity factor and 8,760 operation hours per year), the cashflows in years 16-32 of the sublease would be at least 10% to 23% higher than anticipated by Deloitte.", "We also do not find reliable the Spruce plant value determined under the cost approach in the Deloitte appraisal.", "It is clear the appraisal considered the cost of purchasing an asset that would not meet the minimum operating requirements under the Spruce sublease agreement.", "Therefore, we conclude that the plant Exelon was entitled to receive at the end of the sublease term had characteristics distinctly different from those assumed by Deloitte and Prof. Myers.", "Although the parties did not submit any evidence regarding the amounts CPS would be required to invest in the Spruce station to meet the return standards, the requirement to do so significantly changes the economics of the Spruce transaction.", "We note that Prof. Myers stated in his analysis that \"a capacity factor 20% above [Deloitte] forecasts would move the return vs. cancel boundary up enough to include the base-case scenario [in Prof. Myers' analysis that petitioner would retain the plant].\"", "What Prof. Myers has not considered in his analysis, however, is how the parties allocated the risks and costs related to the diminution in the power plant efficiency.", "According to the Spruce transaction agreement documents, that risk was shifted to CPS. As we explained, if the Spruce plant failed to meet the minimum operating standards at the time it was returned to Exelon, CPS would have to either pay up the diminution in fair market value or exercise the cancellation option to cut its losses.", "Under the circumstances, we find it significantly more likely that CPS, should it attempt to walk away from the transaction and return the Spruce station to Exelon, would face substantial economic losses.", "Accordingly, we find that the range of scenarios under which CPS would decide to exercise its cancellation option is significantly broader than expected by petitioner's experts, including Prof. Myers.", "We also find that both petitioner and CPS, experienced power plant operators having the benefit of professional legal and other advice, understood that the terms of the Spruce transaction were inconsistent with the Deloitte appraisal and the projected future value of the Spruce station.", "The parties understood that it would be very difficult, if not impossible, for CPS to return the Spruce plant at the end of a 32-year sublease in almost the same condition in which CPS received it in 2000 without significant investment.", "Thus, the parties understood and reasonably expected at the time of entering into the Spruce transaction that CPS would exercise the cancellation option at the end of the sublease because meeting the return conditions would be extremely burdensome.", "According to Prof. Myers' analysis, with the required capacity factor of 82% in 2032, more than 20% higher than projected in the Spruce appraisal, it would be economically beneficial for CPS to exercise its cancellation option.", "Moreover, we note that when the City of San Antonio brought suit in court to obtain a declaratory judgment of the continued validity of certain covenants in its outstanding public securities--thereby allowing CPS to enter into the transaction with petitioner--in its initial draft of the petition the city represented that it intended to exercise the cancellation option.", "Even though this representation was subsequently deleted at the suggestion of Winston & Strawn and PwC, this Court infers an understanding among the parties that CPS would exercise the option to reacquire the Spruce plant.", "At the very least, it was reasonably likely at the time of the transaction that the purchase option would be exercised.", "We hold that the Spruce transaction fails the substance over form inquiry because petitioner did not acquire the benefits and burdens of ownership of the Spruce station.", "Petitioner's investment was not subject to more than a de minimis risk of loss. We need not consider the risks and benefits to petitioner of the remaining headlease period because it was reasonably likely that the circular flow of money allowing petitioner to fully recover its investment and interest would close on the last day of the Spruce sublease.", "We agree with respondent that the transaction most closely resembles a financial arrangement. Specifically, the Spruce transaction resembles a loan from Exelon to CPS.", "Exelon funded the Spruce transaction entirely with its own funds and received the funds back with interest in two tranches: the first tranche six months after the closing date and the second tranche at the end of the Spruce sublease term in the form of the cancellation option payment.", "Exelon's return on its investment was predetermined, and Exelon did not have an upside potential or much of downside risk with respect to the Spruce station.", "This is more indicative of a loan than of a genuine equity investment.", "Accordingly, we sustain respondent's disallowance of Exelon's depreciation deductions claimed on the 2001 tax return with respect to the Spruce transaction.", "Because the Scherer and Wansley transactions are structured and documented very similarly, we discuss them together.", "We use the same analysis framework as for the Spruce transaction.", "Petitioner and respondent make the same arguments for the Scherer and Wansley transactions as for the Spruce transaction.", "First, as we noted in discussing the Spruce transaction, a 100% out-of-pocket investment does not necessarily make a transaction nonabusive from a tax standpoint.", "Here, petitioner indeed used the untaxed proceeds from the sale of the Powerton station and did not use any loans to finance the Scherer and Wansley transactions (collectively, MEAG transactions).", "However, petitioner got 77.9% of its initial investment back just six months after the closing of the MEAG transactions in the form of prepaid rent from MEAG.", "A portion of the remaining 22.1% of the initial investment was placed into a trust account and invested in low-risk securities to provide for the payment of the MEAG purchase option at the end of the sublease period for MEAG transactions.", "Another portion was set aside to provide MEAG with the NPV benefit in consideration for entering into the transactions.", "For the same reasons we discussed for the Spruce transaction, we do not find that an out-of-pocket investment automatically shows that petitioner acquired benefits and burdens of ownership of Scherer and Wansley stations.", "This is especially important when six months into the transaction petitioner was in substantially the same cash position as with using loans to finance the leases.", "Second, similarly to the Spruce transaction, we do not see the rights and obligations conveyed by the Scherer and Wansley respective headlease and sublease agreements as significantly altering the rights of the parties.", "Petitioner did not have any obligations to MEAG with respect to the maintenance, operation, or insurance of the Scherer and Wansley stations during the sublease term or the remainder of the headlease.", "Petitioner also did not have to meet any return conditions in the case of headlease termination. The rights and obligations of the parties under the Scherer and Wansley subleases were essentially the same as in the Spruce transaction, with MEAG bearing all the costs and risks related to the interests in the stations it conveyed to petitioner in the MEAG transactions.", "As we observed in the discussion of the Spruce sublease, the terms of the sublease agreements were designed to insulate petitioner from any operational risks.", "Third, similar to the Spruce transaction, we do not find that petitioner's due diligence efforts are somehow indicative of a true ownership interest in the Scherer and Wansley stations.", "We also do not find any merit in petitioner's argument that it was exposed to a risk of MEAG's going bankrupt during the Scherer and Wansley sublease terms.", "Petitioner received an opinion from Holland & Knight that confirmed that the laws of the State of Georgia did not allow municipalities to declare bankruptcy.", "Petitioner's own expert, Dr. Gilson, confirmed in his expert report that Georgia would have to change its laws to allow MEAG to declare bankruptcy.", "We consider this scenario highly unlikely. See UnionBanCal Corp., 113 Fed. Cl. at 135 (discussing that highly unlikely risks do not add substance to a LILO transaction).", "In any event, credit enhancements put in place at the outset of the MEAG transactions provided petitioner with sufficient protection from that risk.", "We find that petitioner also did not face a substantial risk of loss with respect to the payment of the Scherer and Wansley rent by MEAG.", "The rent was prepaid six months into the sublease term, and the stipulated loss value provisions, together with MEAG and UII swaps, insulated petitioner from any significant risk of loss in this respect.", "We now turn to an analysis of whether it was reasonably likely that at the closing of the Scherer and Wansley transactions MEAG would exercise its purchase option.", "Similarly to the Spruce transaction, we will look not only at fair market value of the assets involved as of the option exercise date, but also to the costs to MEAG if it decides to forgo exercising the option.", "We will also briefly address the rights of the Scherer and Wansley coowners, who also received a right to exercise the purchase option if MEAG decided to forgo it.", "Neither petitioner nor respondent argues that there are legal, political, industrial, or technical reasons that would weigh in favor of or against MEAG's exercise of its purchase option.", "Thus, we consider financial and economic aspects of the MEAG transactions first.", "According to the Deloitte appraisal, the undivided interests petitioner received under the MEAG transactions were estimated to have fair market values of $203,800,000 for Wansley and $485,000,000 for Scherer using a discounted cash flow analysis, adjusted for inflation at 2.5% per annum, at the respective lease expiration dates.", "The Wansley purchase option price was set at $214 million, and the Scherer purchase option price was set at $537.1 million, with $143,543,915 and $179,284,424 allocable to the Wansley and Scherer test transactions, respectively.", "Because the Deloitte appraisals and expert reports addressed the Wansley transactions without allocating the values between Wansley 1 and 2, we will use the aggregate analysis and will assume that the projected value of the Wansley interest conveyed in the test transaction bears the same ratio to the overall projected value of the Wansley as the purchase option exercise value for the test transaction to the overall purchase option price.", "The cost approach inflation-adjusted values are $191,300,000 for the Wansley and $481,000,000 for the Scherer interest.", "For the same reasons we discussed supra note 26, we will be using the discounted cashflow results.", "The Deloitte appraisals for the Scherer and Wansley stations suffer from the same deficiencies we identified in our review of the Spruce appraisal.", "Deloitte elected to use the 40.85% corporate tax rate that included a 9% State corporate tax rate, even though MEAG does not pay income tax (and even if it did, Georgia taxes its corporations at a flat 6% rate).", "Winston & Strawn attorneys were very closely involved in the appraisal report preparation process. Deloitte did not consider the costs MEAG would have to incur if it decided not to exercise the purchase option, including the costs of bringing the plants up to the required operating standards.", "Deloitte also did not consider any additional factors that could make MEAG's cotenants consider exercising the purchase options, including obtaining majority control over the Scherer and Wansley stations.", "Petitioner's expert witnesses made the same arguments as for the Spruce transaction. Mr. Reed opined that it was impossible to predict with a degree of certainty whether MEAG or its cotenants would exercise the purchase options at the end of the Scherer and Wansley subleases.", "Ms. Hughes opined that the Deloitte appraisals conformed with the USPAP principles and the Deloitte analysis was reasonable and appropriate.", "Prof. Myers conducted the sensitivity analysis of the Deloitte appraisals and confirmed that if the inflation or electricity prices were higher than predicted by Deloitte, it would increase the likelihood of MEAG's exercising the purchase options.", "Prof. Myers concluded that MEAG would never purchase Wansley or Scherer in order to avoid the cost of a PTPA subsidy.", "Prof. Myers also recognized that changes in other factors, including capital investments, capacity factors, and discount rates will affect MEAG's decision.", "We also note that Prof. Myers used a different corporate tax rate (38.9%) for the Wansley and Scherer transactions.", "His discounted cashflow results, however, were comparable to those in the Deloitte appraisal reports because of several adjustments made by Prof. Myers, such as capital investments.", "Respondent's expert witness Dr. Skinner suggested that Deloitte should have used a 0% corporate tax rate to analyze the MEAG transactions and used a 6.3% discount rate based on cost of debt to MEAG.", "Dr. Skinner also suggested that Deloitte should have conducted sensitivity testing at least for corporate rates.", "With the new assumptions, Dr. Skinner concluded that MEAG would value the Scherer and Wansley stations a lot higher than the purchase option price and thus would be almost certain to exercise the purchase option.", "For similar reasons as those we discussed for the Spruce transaction, we agree that Deloitte should have used a 0% corporate tax rate and the prevailing discount rate in its analysis.", "As with the Spruce transaction, a further problem with the Scherer and Wansley appraisals is that Exelon was entitled to a operating efficiency of Scherer and Wansley at the end of the sublease significantly higher than the values used by Deloitte in the respective appraisals.", "If the Scherer and Wansley stations did not meet the minimum operating requirements outlined in the respective subleases, MEAG would have to pay damages reflecting the diminution in the value of the stations due to decreased efficiency.", "Deloitte and Prof. Myers failed to consider these costs in analyzing whether MEAG would exercise the purchase options at the end of the Scherer and Wansley subleases.", "For Wansley, petitioner was entitled to receive, because MEAG had agreed to deliver, the Wansley station at the end of the sublease with a capacity factor of at least 62% based on 8,760 hours of operation per year with the net energy output of at least 85%.", "The Wansley appraisal by Deloitte and Prof. Myers' report assumed a plant capacity factor of only 66.5% in 2000, declining to 39.2% in 2028 (Wansley sublease expiration year) and to 32.6% in 2045.", "These numbers were based on the engineering reports prepared by Stone & Webster. Thus, petitioner was entitled to receive Wansley at the end of the sublease operating at a capacity factor only 4.5% lower than at the beginning of the sublease.", "Petitioner's entitlement with respect to the capacity factor was 22.8% higher than projected by Deloitte and Prof. Myers.", "For Scherer, petitioner was entitled to receive, because MEAG had agreed to deliver, the Scherer station at the end of the sublease term in 2030 with at least 62% capacity factor based on 8,760 hours of operation per year and net energy output of 87.5%.", "Deloitte and Prof. Myers assumed the plant capacity factor to be 66.5% in 2000, declining to 39.9% in 2030.", "These numbers were based on the engineering reports prepared by Stone & Webster. Thus, petitioner was entitled to receive Scherer at the end of the sublease operating at a capacity factor only 4.5% lower than at the beginning of the sublease.", "Petitioner's entitlement with respect to the capacity factor at the time of the Scherer return was 22.1% higher than projected by Deloitte and Prof. Myers.", "Our observations for the MEAG transactions are very similar to the Spruce transaction discussion. Both petitioner and MEAG had vast experience with operation of power plants.", "Both petitioner and MEAG had the benefit of legal, tax, and other professional advice before and at the time of entering the transaction.", "Both petitioner and MEAG agreed to the return conditions set out in the Scherer and Wansley sublease contracts and understood the importance of the minimum operating standards.", "Thus, it was reasonably likely at the time the MEAG transactions were entered into that MEAG would exercise the purchase option at the end of the Scherer and Wansley subleases, because meeting the return conditions would be extremely burdensome, if not impossible, for MEAG.", "Petitioner may argue that Exelon faced a risk that MEAG would not have sufficient funds to pay the purchase option exercise price.", "We observe that indeed MEAG replaced the collateral pledged to Ambac Credit and Exelon under the UII and MEAG swaps with MEAG's own debt.", "We also observe, however, that both Ambac Credit and petitioner consented to such an exchange. Ambac Credit and petitioner would not have consented to the collateral replacement if they had anticipated they would have any problems with the payment at the end of the sublease term.", "In fact, one of the goals of replacing the collateral was to replace the Government securities, which did not give sufficient yield in the beginning of the 2000s, with relatively secure but higher yield instruments.", "Because MEAG could not declare bankruptcy under the laws of Georgia, we find that petitioner did not bear any significant risk of nonpayment at the end of the sublease periods for the Scherer and Wansley stations.", "One of the significant differences between the MEAG transactions and the Spruce transaction is that MEAG's cotenants in the Wansley and Scherer stations received the right to exercise the purchase option at the end of the subleases should MEAG fail to do so.", "Petitioner and respondent did not put much emphasis on that right in their briefs. Prof. Myers, petitioner's expert, concluded that cotenants would use the same analysis as MEAG to decide whether to exercise the purchase options.", "We agree with this statement, but we also emphasize that the cotenants may have some other significant considerations that may make it more likely that they will step in and purchase the interests in the Scherer and Wansley stations if MEAG fails to do so.", "This further insulates petitioner from the risk of loss in the MEAG transactions or a risk of MEAG's nonpayment.", "We hold that the Wansley and Scherer transactions fail the substance-over-form inquiry because petitioner did not acquire the benefits and burdens of ownership of the Scherer and Wansley stations.", "It was reasonably likely at the time the MEAG transactions were entered into that MEAG or its cotenants would exercise the purchase options at the end of the sublease term.", "Accordingly, we do not need to consider the risks and benefits to petitioner of the remaining headlease periods.", "We agree with respondent that the MEAG transactions most closely resemble financial arrangements. Specifically, the MEAG transactions resemble loans from Exelon to MEAG because Exelon's income was predetermined and the transaction did not have an upside potential or significant downside risks for Exelon.", "Because Exelon funded the transactions with its own funds and there are two distinct tranches of money it expected to receive back, it is appropriate to characterize each transaction as creating two loan instruments: one to be repaid six months after the closing date in the form of prepaid rent, and the second to be repaid at the time of the purchase option payment.", "Accordingly, we sustain respondent's disallowance of Exelon's depreciation deductions claimed on the 2001 tax return with respect to the Spruce transaction.", "Respondent further asserts that we should disallow petitioner's depreciation, interest, and transaction cost deductions claimed on the 2001 tax return because the test transactions lacked economic substance.", "Respondent did not directly challenge the 1999 like-kind exchange gain deferral under the economic substance doctrine.", "Because we resolve the issues related to the disputed deductions claimed in petitioner's 2001 tax return on substance over form grounds, we need not address this alternative theory.", "IV. Consequences for the 1999 Tax Year Section 1031 Like-Kind Exchange Adjustment", "Section 1031(a)(1) provides: \"No gain or loss shall be recognized on the exchange of property held for productive use in a trade or business or for investment if such property is exchanged solely for property of like kind which is to be held either for productive use in a trade or business or for investment.\"", "The regulations further explain that \"the words 'like kind' have reference to the nature or character of the property and not to its grade or quality.", "One kind or class of property may not, under * * * section [1031], be exchanged for property of a different kind or class.\"", "We have held that all of the test transactions failed the substance over form inquiry because petitioner did not acquire the benefits and burdens of ownership in the assets involved in the test transactions.", "We have also concluded that the test transactions are more similar to loans made by petitioner to CPS and MEAG because petitioner's return on its investment was predetermined at the time petitioner entered into the test transactions.", "Accordingly, in 1999 petitioner exchanged the Powerton and Collins power plants for an interest in financial instruments.", "Such an exchange fails to meet the \"like kind\" requirement outlined in the Code and the regulations. Thus, petitioner must recognize the gain it received in 1999 on the sale of the Powerton and Collins plants under section 1001.", "V. 2001 Interest Expense Deductions and Rental Income", "Six months after the closing of the test transactions, petitioner received prepayment of all rent from CPS and MEAG due under the respective sublease agreements.", "Petitioner reported the rent payments as income according to the provisions of section 467.", "Section 467 governs the reporting of rental income from rental agreements that are treated as leases for Federal income tax purposes and which either have increasing or decreasing rents, or prepaid or deferred rents.", "See sec. 467(d)(1) ; Sec. 1.467-1(c), (h)(12), Income Tax Regs. If a rental agreement constitutes a section 467 rental agreement, the lessor and the lessee must take into account only the sum of the section 467 rent and interest during the taxable year.", "We have concluded that petitioner did not acquire the benefits and burdens of ownership in the Spruce, Wansley, or Scherer plant.", "We have also concluded that the test transactions most closely resemble financial arrangements in the form of loans from petitioner to CPS and MEAG.", "Thus, the agreements among petitioner, CPS, and MEAG are not lease agreements for Federal tax purposes under section 467, and petitioner may not deduct interest or include rental income with respect to them for the taxable year 2001.", "This is consistent with our conclusion that petitioner failed to enter into a like-kind exchange in 1999 and must recognize the gain on the sale of the Powerton and Collins stations.", "VI.

Because petitioner, CPS, and MEAG reasonably expected that the respective cancellation/purchase options would be exercised at the end of the sublease period, the purchase option price was fixed, and the funds for payments set aside (defeased) as of the closing date, the transactions represent fixed obligations similar to those discussed in John Hancock.", "Accordingly, we uphold respondent's application of the OID rules and his calculation of OID income thereunder.", "In addition, we note that because each transaction was fully funded by petitioner's money and created two distinctive tranches of money--one payable in six months, one at the end of the respective sublease term--each tranche should be treated as a separate debt instrument under the OID rules.", "Ordinary and necessary business expenses paid or incurred in carrying on any trade or business are generally deductible.", "See sec. 162(a). We have concluded as to all test transactions that they are properly characterized as loans from petitioner to CPS and MEAG.", "We also concluded that for each transaction, the loan consisted of two tranches, one due six months after the closing date, the other due at the time of the cancellation/purchase price option payment.", "Under section 1.1273-2(g)(4), Income Tax Regs., transaction costs must be included as an additional amount lent to the borrowers.", "See also John Hancock Life Ins.

Further, because Winston & Strawn directed the conclusions that Deloitte had to arrive at, we are highly suspicious that the tax opinions are similarly tainted.", "We also concluded that the technical and engineering assumptions used in the Deloitte appraisals were inconsistent with the return conditions specified in the test transaction documents, which made the exercise of the purchase/cancellation options considerably more likely.", "Winston & Strawn, as the firm that drafted the transaction documents and was closely involved in all stages of the test transactions, knew or should have known of this defect and that its tax opinions were therefore based on unreasonable assumptions and arrived at unreasonable conclusions in the light of how the transactions were actually structured.", "The third prong of the Neonatology test requires the taxpayer to show that it relied in good faith on the adviser's judgment.", "There is a longstanding policy of not requiring taxpayers to second-guess the work of a tax professional providing the advice.", "As the Supreme Court has stated, \"[t]o require the taxpayer to challenge the attorney, to seek a 'second opinion,' or to try to monitor counsel on the provisions of the Code himself would nullify the very purpose of seeking the advice of a presumed expert in the first place.\"", "Boyle, 469 U.S. at 251; see also Bruce v.

The team reported its findings to petitioner's board of directors, and the board approved the transactions.", "Although the board did not have the benefit of reviewing the final versions of the tax opinions, it did have a chance to ask questions of the Winston & Strawn team as well as the PwC team.", "In addition to Winston & Strawn, petitioner engaged PwC (financial and accounting adviser), Arthur Andersen (accounting adviser), Sidley Austin (regulatory counsel), Deloitte (valuation), Stone & Webster (engineering and environmental adviser), Vinson & Elkins (Texas counsel), and Holland & Knight (Georgia counsel).", "Petitioner's employees and the board, however, had other considerations in mind as well: They were under pressure to find a reasonable solution to the problem of higher-than-anticipated revenue from the sale of its fossil fuel power plants.", "The clock on the section 1031 transaction was ticking, and the amount at stake--over $1.6 billion of potentially taxable sale proceeds--was too significant to let the like-kind exchange plan fall apart.", "Our analysis of the test transactions shows that petitioner knew or should have known that CPS and MEAG were reasonably likely to exercise their respective cancellation/purchase options because they would not be able to return the Spruce, Scherer, and Wansley power plants to petitioner without incurring significant expenses to meet the return requirements.", "It is true that Winston & Strawn provided a very favorable tax opinion on the test transactions, notwithstanding the obvious inconsistency of the return provisions and the projected plant capacity factor at the end of the respective subleases.", "Yet we are not persuaded that Winston & Strawn's tax opinion can serve as a shield for petitioner under the circumstances.", "We believe that petitioner fully recognized that a plant with a capacity factor of 82%--the minimum rate at which the Spruce station had to be running when returned by CPS upon expiration of the sublease--would be worth significantly more than the same plant with a capacity factor of 58%--the capacity factor used in the Deloitte appraisals.", "Petitioner, as a sophisticated power plant operator, must have appreciated that it would be very expensive for CPS to sufficiently upgrade the plant to meet the capacity requirements.", "Thus, petitioner must have understood that Winston & Strawn's tax opinions, based on the Deloitte appraisals, were flawed.", "See supra note 29 for a fuller explanation of these numbers. The difference in capacity factors for MEAG transactions was in the same range.", "This brings us to two conclusions: first, petitioner could not have relied on the Winston & Strawn tax opinions in good faith because petitioner, with its expertise and sophistication, knew or should have known that the conclusions in the tax opinions were inconsistent with the terms of the deal.", "Second, in the light of the previous conclusion, petitioner's alleged reliance on Winston & Strawn's tax advice fails the Neonatology test.", "Petitioner also alleges that it relied on its auditor, Arthur Andersen, to raise red flags about the transactions.", "According to petitioner, Arthur Andersen had no objections or challenges to petitioner's reporting of the like-kind exchange.", "Unlike petitioner, Arthur Andersen did not have the benefit of vast experience in operating power plants and may have overlooked the issue of return conditions.", "The record is also silent as to what documents related to the transactions were actually reviewed by Arthur Andersen and to what extent.", "We are thus not persuaded by petitioner's argument. --------", "We note that petitioner expended significant resources on due diligence and consulting fees related to the like-kind exchange and the test transactions.", "However, we find troubling petitioner's cavalier disregard of the risks connected with the test transactions and the underlying facts.", "Mr. Berdelle, petitioner's controller and a senior employee with substantial discretionary and strategic authority, testified that he had read the Winston & Strawn tax opinions and was otherwise intimately involved in the decisionmaking process behind the proposed transaction.", "In addition, Winston & Strawn had advised petitioner of certain tax risks that could accompany the proposed transactions, and indeed petitioner registered the test transactions as a confidential corporate tax shelter around the same time it entered into the transactions.", "It is true that Mr. Roling and other employees of petitioner besides Mr. Berdelle had only cursorily read the opinion package prepared by Winston & Strawn.", "This fact on its own might be sufficient to demonstrate a failure by petitioner to exercise ordinary and reasonable care in entering into the transaction and preparing the related tax returns.", "However, considering that petitioner (1) was a sophisticated taxpayer, (2) claims to have read the Winston & Strawn tax opinions in their entirety, (3) knew or should have known that Winston & Strawn's tax opinions based on the Deloitte appraisal reports were flawed, (4) was apprised of the risk that the proposed transactions might be classified as corporate tax shelters and registered them as such with the IRS around the same time it entered into the test transactions, and (5) proceeded with the transactions anyway, we find that petitioner disregarded the applicable rules and regulations.", "At a minimum, petitioner carelessly disregarded the rules and regulations by failing to \"exercise reasonable diligence to determine the correctness of a return position.\"", "See sec. 1.6662-3(b)(2), Income Tax Regs.

We hold that the OID income should be included in the calculation of the underpayment subject to the section 6662 penalty for the 2001 tax year.", "We have considered all of the arguments that petitioner made, and to the extent not discussed above, conclude that those arguments not discussed herein are irrelevant, moot, or without merit.", "We have considered respondent's arguments only to the extent stated herein.", "We note that the cost approach would result in lower projected future fair market value according to Deloitte appraisals for the test transactions.", "We will use the discounted cashflow analysis because petitioner relied mostly on discounted cashflow in pricing the Spruce, Scherer, and Wansley transactions.", "We believe this will provide us with more consistent results."]}

After we determine an account is spam, malicious automation, or fake, we stop counting it in our mDAU, or other related metrics.", "We also treat multiple accounts held by a single person or organization as multiple mDAU because we permit people and organizations to have more than one account.", "Additionally, some accounts used by organizations are used by many people within the organization.

As a result, it is not clear that there has been any change of view at the DOJ, where DOJ Assistant Attorney General Jonathan Kanter has previously stated that investigations resolved with merger remedies should be the “exception, not the rule.”", "Yet the DOJ was generally quiet in Q2 2022, concluding only one significant investigation as compared with eight from the FTC.", "The absence of DOJ settlements has been largely accompanied so far by silence rather than a flurry of complaints.", "The average duration of significant investigations dropped nearly two months in Q2 2022 to 10.7 months.", "Of note, the median also was 10.7 months, indicating that the average is not being influenced by any extreme outliers.", "When combined with the higher average duration of investigations in Q1, the average duration for the first half of 2022 was 11.5 months, or just slightly above the average from the prior two years.", "The average duration of a significant investigation that concluded with a complaint in the first half of 2022 was 11.9 months, while the average duration of a significant investigation that concluded in a consent was 10 months.", "This data unexpectedly indicates that the FTC may be speeding up significant investigations resulting in a consent agreement.", "The longer average duration of matters that result in a complaint is notable given April 2022 statements from the DOJ Principal Deputy Assistant Attorney General that DOJ may seek “faster access to courts” in some cases, because “[t]here are some problems you can see from outer space” and DOJ does not have “to wait one or two years” for parties to comply with a second request before filing a complaint.", "Along those lines, the only merger challenge filed by DOJ in Q2 2022 concerned Booz Allen Hamilton’s proposed acquisition of Everwatch, which was only publicly announced 3.5 months earlier.", "There are reasons, however, not to draw too many inferences from Booz Allen Hamilton/Everwatch, which was the only significant investigation concluded by DOJ in Q2 2022.", "Most notably, the complaint in that matter alleges a time-sensitive violation of the Section 1 of the Sherman Act, which is not common in merger challenges.", "In addition, public filings indicate that this deal was notified several months before it was publicly announced, likely based on a letter of intent.", "As a result, we would caution against inferring that DOJ is proceeding more quickly in most cases based on this distinct outlier.", "Indeed, this transaction is the only transaction notified between June 2021 and June 2022 that has been the subject of a significant investigation concluded by DOJ as of the end of Q2 2022.", "To the extent there is a pattern here, the data suggest that DOJ is increasingly willing to bypass steps in the formal HSR process where it perceives parties may be playing procedural games with the timeline.", "In Booz Allen Hamilton/Everwatch, for example, the buyer pulled-and-refiled its HSR filing a highly unusual four times before DOJ issued second requests.", "DOJ then filed its complaint alleging short-term harms to a competitive-bid process before the parties substantially complied with their second requests.", "Similarly, in Cargotec/Konecranes, DOJ only informed the parties it would file a complaint to block the transaction after the parties delayed complying with their second requests for more than 18 months after their deal was announced.", "For that deal, the DOJ Principal Deputy Assistant Attorney General said: “[W]hat we saw with our staff was that the protracted posture of the merger review was already having an effect on incentives to compete that was creating uncertainty in the market.\"", "The same logic presumably applied to DOJ’s view of the four pull-and-refiles in Booz Allen Hamilton/Everwatch.", "In other words, where DOJ perceives that parties are using stall tactics to slow down its review, it may be more likely to proceed to court with a complaint.", "The nine significant investigations concluded in Q2 2022 are slightly above the average observed for second quarters over the four prior years but seem low given the tidal wave of HSR filings observed for well over a year now.", "The number of significant investigations concluded in the first half of 2022, for example, is below the number concluded in the first half of 2020, despite many fewer filings.", "This small number of concluded investigations could be a sign that the agencies have limited resources for conducting additional significant investigations without larger budgets, but it also could be an indication that more transactions have become ensnared in prolonged investigations that have yet to conclude.", "EC Concluded Few Significant Investigations, Average Duration Remains Stable", "After increased enforcement activity in Q1 2022, we saw a marked decrease in Q2 2022 with only three significant investigations concluded this quarter.", "While slightly higher than the number of significant investigations concluded in H1 2021, this is more than 20 percent below the average number of significant investigations concluded in the first half of a year since 2016.", "Only one transaction, Kingspan Group/Trimo, underwent a Phase II investigation until the deal was ultimately abandoned in Q2 2022.", "This is significantly lower than the five Phase II cases concluded in Q1 2022. Three transactions are however currently subject to an in-depth investigation.", "As such 2022 could still conclude with an above average number of Phase II decisions.", "The new abandoned deal in Q2 2022 takes the proportion of significant investigations concluded in the first half of 2022 and resulting in a prohibited or an abandoned deal to 44 percent.", "While this is lower than the 50 percent of significant investigations that met the same fate in Q1 alone, it still indicates a heightened risk for deals taken to Phase II.", "This statistic should, however, not be overinterpreted as, at the same time, the number of deals triggering a significant investigation is trending downward (see next section on intervention rates).", "Turning to duration, the only Phase II investigation concluded in Q2 2022 took 20.3 months, bringing the average length of Phase II cases concluded in H1 to 19 months, broadly in line with the 2021 average.", "Excluding the Hyundai Heavy Industries Holdings/Daewoo Shipbuilding & Marine Engineering transaction, which was ultimately abandoned in Q1 2022 almost 36 months after announcement, the average stabilizes at 15.6 months, which is more in line with 2019-2020 average durations.", "The duration of the Kingspan Group/Trimo review also supports the trend highlighted in our Q1 2022 Report, showing that Phase II investigations lasting more than 20 months from announcement have a higher risk of being ultimately blocked or abandoned.", "The EC concluded two cases with remedies following a Phase I investigation in Q2 2022, after an average review of 9.8 months.", "This takes the average duration of Phase I remedy investigations to 9.4 months over the first half of 2022, a nearly eight percent decrease compared to average duration of Phase I remedy cases in 2021, possibly indicating a return to pre-pandemic timelines.", "Looking forward, the number of EU filings continues to trend high, although slightly below the 2021-record number.", "In contrast, the EC intervention rate is further decreasing, with fewer significant investigations conducted at the EU level.", "The Intervention Rate is Dropping in Both the U.S. and the EU", "In our last two reports, we have highlighted that the proportion of total notified transactions that receive significant investigations (the “intervention rate”) has fallen in recent years.", "Estimating the exact intervention rate can be difficult because the length of concluded significant investigations varies.", "The best we can do is look at the significant investigations that have been concluded, when those transactions were filed, and the number of transactions that were notified over the same period.", "In the United States, when we look at that data by quarter for HSR filings made going back to Q1 2019, we see a considerable drop in the intervention rate for HSR filings made since Q4 2020.", "It is important to keep in mind that these figures only reflect significant investigations concluded as of June 30, 2022.", "Given the average duration of significant investigations, there are likely deals that were notified (for 2021 in particular) that are still subject to significant investigations that have not yet concluded.", "Nevertheless, our data show that the intervention rate for transactions notified in the first year of the Trump administration was more than double the intervention rate for transactions notified in the first year of the Biden administration at the same point in time.", "While the agencies received less than half of the number of notified transactions in the first year of the Trump administration, they had concluded three more significant investigations related to those transactions within six months after the year had ended.", "Looking beyond Q2 2018, the U.S. antitrust agencies concluded 11 more significant investigations of deals that were filed in 2017, such that the final intervention rate for transactions notified in 2017 was 1.5 percent.", "To match that same final intervention rate for transactions filed in the first year of the Biden administration, the U.S. antitrust agencies would need to conclude 45 more significant investigations for deals filed in 2021.", "Based on the current data, it is highly unlikely that the intervention rate for the first year of the Biden administration will even come close.", "The EU data shows a similar trend. Looking at the number of EU filings since Q1 2019, and the number of such filings that resulted in a significant investigation, there is a marked drop as of Q3 2020.", "While, on average, six percent of deals filed between Q1 2019 and Q2 2020 led to a significant investigation, only three percent of the filings submitted between Q3 2020 and Q4 2021 triggered a significant investigation.", "Taking into account ongoing investigations on the EU side, data show that this downward trend continues in 2022, with an intervention rate averaging two percent for the first half of the year.", "The recent ruling in the Illumina/Grail case could affect this trend in the EU. More than a year after the EC adopted a new approach to Article 22, only two cases have been referred under this provision, both resulting in a Phase II investigation.", "The limited use of this tool so far could have been linked to the uncertainty surrounding the new approach following Illumina’s appeal to the General Court of the EU against the referral of its deal.", "With the General Court greenlighting the EC’s approach on 13 July 2022, however, we may see an increased number of deals subject to article 22 referrals – unless national competition authorities decide to wait until the final ruling of the Court of the Justice of the EU on Illumina’s further appeal against the General Court judgement before starting to make real use of this mechanism.", "Parties to transactions subject to significant merger investigations continue to face an elevated risk of seeing their deal blocked or abandoned, even if the intervention rate shows fewer deals as a percentage of merger filings may receive scrutiny.", "To ensure the ability to defend their deals through a potential investigation, parties to the average “significant” deal in the U.S. should plan on at least 12 months for the agencies to investigate their transaction and may want to add on additional time to address the continuing uncertainty at the agencies.", "Parties should also plan for another seven to nine months if they want to preserve their right to litigate an adverse agency decision.", "On the EU side, parties to transactions likely to proceed to Phase II investigations should allow for at least 19 months from announcement to clearance and should not rely on the theoretical deadlines provided for in the EU Merger Regulation, even after the deal has been formally notified.", "If the investigation is likely to be resolved in Phase I with remedies, parties should plan on around 10 months from announcement to a decision."]}

existing but financially struggling U.S. nuclear plants in curbing carbon emissions and addressing climate change.", "Questions about nuclear power's costs and safety that kept it at 18% to 20.6% of U.S. electricity generation from 1990 to 2020 left little support for new plants.", "But extreme weather-driven disasters and predictions of much worse in the recent reports from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change and National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration are driving new thinking about existing plants.", "\"The economic feasibility of existing nuclear is a very different question depending on whether the power market values clean energy,\" said Exelon Senior Vice President of Regulatory Policy and Analysis Mason Emnett.", "In a power market that compensates all clean resources, \"our nuclear units could compete, operate safely and reliably, and be relicensed.\"", "\"Financial incentives for zero-carbon generation are a no-brainer,\" said Analysis Group Senior Advisor Susan Tierney, a former nuclear skeptic, Department of Energy (DOE) official, and Massachusetts utilities regulator.", "Unsafe nuclear plants should not be preserved, but incentives for existing and safe nuclear are better than rising emissions from increased use of natural gas generation, she added.", "Growing support for new federal and state initiatives to support nuclear power shows clean energy advocates and power system analysts are confronting the possibility that the transition to net zero emissions may require investment in existing nuclear.", "The changing appreciation of existing nuclear, and its role in fighting climate change, is reflected in laws enacted from 2017 to 2019 to fund zero emissions credits (ZECs) in Connecticut, Illinois, New Jersey, New York and Ohio.", "While ZEC programs differ, existing nuclear plants generally receive above the electricity market price for the power they produce based on \"an established social cost of carbon\" that reflects the environmental cost of emissions, a 2019 Department of Energy report said.", "Exelon's recent fight for new ZECs for plants not included in Illinois's 2016 allocation began with a state Environmental Protection Agency-commissioned report by Synapse Energy Economics on nuclear economics.", "But it was the link between nuclear power and the climate crisis fight that led to the Illinois House and Senate passing comprehensive clean energy legislation this month with bipartisan support in both chambers.", "\"Nuclear power is necessary for the state's transition to 100% clean energy,\" according to the recent legislation.", "To avoid losing \"environmental benefits\" from Exelon's nuclear generation, the bill instructs Illinois regulators to allocate approximately $700 million in carbon mitigation credits to three non-competitive Exelon plants — Byron, Dresden and Braidwood — from June 1, 2022 through May 31, 2027.", "SB 2408's new ZECs for nuclear had bipartisan support because responding to climate change requires \"closing fossil resources first,\" Citizens Utility Board of Illinois Executive Director David Kolata said.", "\"Closing nuclear plants too soon could prevent reducing emissions in the most cost-effective way.\"", "This kind of support may also be needed in other states.", "Nuclear provides 85% of the clean energy in Maryland and Illinois, 91% in Pennsylvania, and over 50% in New York, Exelon Executive Vice President and Chief Generation Officer Bryan Hanson told a July U.S. Chamber of Commerce webinar.", "But nuclear plants are being closed because \"outdated markets don't distinguish between dirty coal electrons and carbon-free electrons.\"", "Pennsylvania, for instance, wants to keep its nuclear generation at current levels to prevent increasing the 66% of its electricity generation that comes from fossil fuels until it can cost-effectively develop alternative zero emissions resources, according to the state's 2021 Climate Action Plan, released September 22.", "But more cost effective natural gas has been driving the state's nuclear generation out of the PJM market that supplies the state’s grid, according to June data from the Energy Information Administration.", "And renewables remain only 3% of the state’s electricity supply.", "To keep its nuclear generation competitive long enough to develop renewables, Pennsylvania's legislature can pass legislation approving ZECs, its action plan said.", "At present, however, it appears legislators may be reluctant to take on the costs and challenges from renewables advocates, the plan and state leaders acknowledged.", "Longstanding debates about a price on carbon continue while federal lawmakers presently consider a clean energy standard and tax credits that would support existing nuclear plants.", "A national policy that is \"technology neutral\" will drive cost-effective decarbonization, Exelon's Emnett said.", "\"A price on carbon will do that very efficiently. A well-designed clean energy standard can largely achieve the same thing, or it could be done through tax policy\" and \"we'll meet policymakers where they are\" to protect the existing fleet.", "\"Nuclear power can't be dismissed as a potential part of the long-term climate solution,\" a 2018 report by long-time nuclear skeptic the Union of Concerned Scientists (UCS) agreed.", "But ZECs should be market based, available to other clean energy sources, and only go to plants that are verified as safe, need financial support, and would avoid increased emissions, UCS stipulated.", "Without incentives, \"cheap natural gas will increasingly drive the retirement of zero-emitting nuclear plants, canceling out gains in emission reductions,\" a March 2021 independent analysis by consulting firm Rhodium Group confirmed.", "Nuclear power's value in the climate fight has won bipartisan support in federal planning and the Biden administration's infrastructure bill, Department of Energy Acting Assistant Secretary and Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary for Nuclear Energy Kathryn Huff told the U.S. Chamber webinar.", "The Senate's $1.2 trillion Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (H.R. 3684) was passed August 10 by a 69-30 vote.", "It incorporated the Senate's bipartisan American Nuclear Infrastructure Act (S. 2373), includes $6 billion to fund ZECs from 2022 to 2026 where they are demonstrated as economically necessary to limit emissions.", "It is expected to be reconciled with the House's more ambitious but unfinished infrastructure bill scheduled for a vote on Sept. 30.", "The Senate bill's ZECs would be allocated through competitive bidding by plant operators. They would go to financially threatened plants certified as likely to lead to increased carbon emissions if closed and certified as operationally safe by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC).", "The final infrastructure bill could also include a clean energy standard, which would resemble state requirements that electricity providers procure progressively larger amounts of emissions-free energy.", "As a national mandate, it could face rejection by conservative lawmakers and evolve into a more politically palatable clean electricity payment plan that offers incentives to procure zero emissions energy, according to University of California at Davis Economist James Bushnell.", "But a Clean Electricity Performance Program, like the one approved this month by the House Energy and Commerce committee as part of the House version of the budget reconciliation bill, has unrecognized potential pitfalls, Bushnell said.", "It could lead to double-counting of clean energy or duplicitous shifting of clean energy procurements between providers that would threaten customer costs.", "An alternative to the infrastructure bill initiatives is the Zero-Emission Nuclear Power Production Credit Act of 2021 (S. 2291).", "It would provide a $0.015/kWh production tax credit (PTC) to existing nuclear and was recently endorsed by both the NRC and the Nuclear Energy Institute (NEI).", "It has obtained little attention and not emerged from committee while lawmakers work through versions of the infrastructure bill.", "That PTC \"will make an enormous difference for climate and for our nuclear plants,\" Exelon President/CEO Chris Crane said Aug. 4 in the company's Q2 earnings release.", "There are also provisions in existing legislation and proposed legislation for advanced nuclear technologies.", "Another bill includes incentives for research, development and demonstration of advanced nuclear technologies and small modular reactors.", "Interest in these technologies as part of the climate fight was reflected in PacifiCorp's August 2021 long term resource plan, which proposed a 500 MW TerraPower advanced nuclear reactor, to be online in 2028, to replace the company's retiring coal plants.", "But some advanced nuclear designs \"pose even more safety, proliferation and environmental risks than the current fleet,\" a March 2021 UCS analysis concluded.", "And advanced nuclear technologies \"require rethinking incentives\" because \"other clean energy resources are more immediately available,\" added Center for Energy Efficiency and Renewable Technologies (CEERT) Executive Director V. John White.", "Beyond doubts about advanced nuclear technologies are bigger unresolved questions about nuclear power's safety and costs.", "It may be appropriate to provide financial supports for an existing nuclear facility if it can operate safely and if there are inadequate cost-effective alternatives to prevent it being replaced with emissions-creating generation, analysts said.", "\"Diablo was one incident away from a disaster, its maintenance is expensive, and California has affordable alternative zero emissions resources available,\" said CEERT's White, who helped convince Pacific Gas and Electric (PG&E) to close Diablo Canyon, California's last nuclear plant, in 2025.", "\"Indian Point's proximity to New York City made its questionable operational history a factor.\"", "\"Indian Point was shut down because of its threat to New York City,\" the Analysis Group's Tierney agreed.", "\"But the upstate New York nuclear plants got ZECs because they had good operating histories and delivered economic benefits.\"", "Exelon's claims that its nuclear plants' safety and reliability are good and getting better are supported by the NRC, but UCS remains dubious.", "\"Safety issues are economic issues,\" UCS Director of Nuclear Power Safety Ed Lyman said. \"Industry pressure on the NRC to reduce costs for maintenance and refueling have weakened safety standards\" set by the commission's Reactor Oversight Process (ROP) \"over the past few years,\" he told Utility Dive.", "New Biden administration appointments to the NRC, including Commission Chair Christopher Hanson, led to NRC Staff's August 5 retraction of two papers that would have decreased ROP inspection frequency and intensity, Lyman acknowledged.", "\"But every operational incident reviewed this year has involved inadequate maintenance and the impact of the new leadership is not yet clear.", "Safety might be better, or they might have changed standards,\" he said.", "\"It is good that stakeholders raise safety concerns, but the NRC has extended the licenses of the bulk of existing fleet, some to 80 years,\" and \"their owners will use them as a backbone to reach their climate goals,\" said former NRC Commissioner and nuclear advocate Jeffrey Merrifield, now a Pillsbury-Winthrop law firm partner.", "The NRC \"has consistently and rigorously assessed the ROP\" and NRC safety inspections show \"almost every U.S. nuclear power plant is operating at the highest level of performance,\" NRC spokesperson Scott Burnell added in an email.", "But nuclear plant owners may not continue to take on the costs of inspections and maintenance necessary, Lyman cautioned.", "There is an \"absolutely necessary\" but elusive difference for the NRC to identify \"between barely acceptable and really acceptable.\"", "The linkage between safety and economics raises even harder-to-answer questions about the cost of having nuclear power or other firm capacity to achieve deep decarbonization.", "There is growing, though not unanimous, consensus that nuclear or another form of firm power will be needed to cost-effectively reach net zero emissions, scientists and analysts said.", "Many policymakers and nuclear advocates see financial support to existing nuclear as the most immediate and cost-effective of the firm power choices.", "But there is no consensus on the most cost-effective way to achieve 100% renewable energy because cost analyses have \"many nonlinearities and unknown unknowns,\" according to the authors of a National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) report in May on the challenges of identifying the lowest cost power mix.", "\"Firm capacity\" that can be called on at any time like nuclear energy, thermal generation with carbon capture and storage (CCS), geothermal, green hydrogen, or other clean fuels will be needed to assure the best system reliability at very high renewables penetrations, according to studies using multiple state-of-the-art modeling tools by NREL, UCS, Princeton University, Evolved Energy Research and Energy and Environmental Economics (E3).", "That need for firm capacity is only at or above 95% renewable energy penetrations, and even at 100% renewables, the added costs of overbuilding renewables and storage instead of using firm capacity \"were still less than $0.04/kWh,\" Stanford University Professor of Civil and Environmental Engineering and Director of the Atmosphere and Energy Program Mark Z. Jacobson disagreed.", "But other studies do not validate the greater cost-effectiveness of overbuilding renewables and storage to supporting firm capacity in reaching net zero emissions.", "\"Nuclear or another firm capacity is part of the picture if the goal is zero carbon\" because \"getting to zero carbon with only wind and solar and batteries and even hydrogen is very expensive,\" E3 Senior Partner Arne Olson insisted.", "Power sector emissions reductions of 80% to 100% below 1990 levels in the Pacific Northwest are \"achievable at manageable cost, provided that firm capacity is available,\" E3's March 2020 assessment concluded.", "The same is true for New England, its November 2020 modeling of the region found.", "\"[W]e need to build the heck out of renewables now because they are cheap and scalable, but they will not get us to the finish line.\"", "Other research agreed that the absence of firm power resources increase the cost of reaching 100% decarbonization.", "Models commissioned by environmental groups Environmental Defense Fund and Clean Air Task Force found renewables and batteries alone would increase wholesale electricity rates \"65% over today.\"", "The most cost-effective approach likely includes clean firm resources like CCS, nuclear and clean fuels, and \"we need to invest heavily in them so they are live options in the 2030s,\" E3's Olson said.", "\"And we need to build the heck out of renewables now because they are cheap and scalable, but they will not get us to the finish line.\"", "But even with firm capacity like nuclear energy, the costs from adding new generation and transmission infrastructure will be significant.", "Getting to 100% renewables by 2050, even with firm capacity, raises system costs by 29% because \"system costs increase nonlinearly for the last few percent approaching 100%,\" an NREL June 2021 study found.", "\"It is not clear how much electricity prices and price profiles would be impacted\" by these system costs, NREL Senior Energy Analyst and co-author of the May and June papers Trieu Mai told Utility Dive.", "\"There might be high prices at some hours, but not at others, which might increase demand for flexibility and drive electrification.\"", "It is also not certain how research might lower the costs of distributed generation, which means the technologies for the last 5% to 10% of a 100% renewable energy system \"are highly uncertain,\" he added.", "But \"the U.S. is still at 20% renewables and the challenge of deploying the technologies that are commercially available now is important before the challenge of the last 5% to 10% emerges.\"", "Traditionally, technology development follows a walk-trot-run trajectory, he acknowledged. But to meet the Biden administration's 100% decarbonization by 2035 goal, \"we have to sprint for the next 14 years.\"", "Making the necessary and appropriate expenditures to keeping existing nuclear generation in place may be the most cost-effective way to get across that net zero emissions finish line.", "But despite nuclear advocates' aggressive push, uncertainties about nuclear's cost and safety keep it among the firm power options rather than the preferred one, scientists and analysts agree."]}
