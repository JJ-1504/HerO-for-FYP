Last year, Telstra launched the world’s first Gigabit-class LTE network with the help of Qualcomm, supporting 2 Gbps download speeds.", "RELATED: Boingo CEO says 5G represents big opportunity", "Qualcomm is big in the cellular chip business, but it also makes Wi-Fi solutions. While the industry tends to think of licensed and cellular when it comes to 5G, Finley said Wi-Fi continues to evolve and accelerate.", "Wi-Fi 6 is coming—and it’s already here in a lot of ways; the Samsung Galaxy S10 supports it. Boingo also has been involved in a successful Wi-Fi 6 trial at John Wayne Airport.", "RELATED: Wi-Fi Alliance certification program for Wi-Fi 6 coming in Q3", "When 5G is added to the licensed side and Wi-Fi 6 on the unlicensed side, along with more spectrum in the pipeline, the two flavors of technology both will be in demand.", "“End users just want to be connected,” and they don’t necessarily think in terms of licensed or unlicensed, he said.", "So, are there any implications for Boingo if the Sprint/T-Mobile merger does or doesn’t happen? “Not really,” Finley said.", "Whether they’re operating separately or together, Boingo will be there to serve."]}

Comparable to last quarter, this puts datacenter at just above 19% of their total revenue.", "Though still far from NVIDIA's gaming revenues, the datacenter business is at this point the darling of the company, as the massive growth potential for this market and its high margin outlook is what's been fueling NVIDIA's own growth for the past two years.", "The OEM and IP segment reported the most modest gains, up 3% year-over-year and down 24% sequentially.", "The quarter-to-quarter sequential decrease is largely due to lessening mining demand, and NVIDIA commented that cryptomining boards accounted for $70 million in Q3 as opposed to $150 million in Q2.", "Last, and for this quarter the least, automotive revenue was up 13% year-over-year to total at a record $144 million, primarily infotainment modules, but also including production DRIVE PX platforms and self-driving car development agreements.", "Along with revenue from Nintendo Switch SoC modules, this contributed to a 26% sequential and 74% year-over-year increase for Tegra revenue.", "Taking a step back, the past two years have seen the gaming and datacenter segments act as the main drivers for this kind of quarterly growth.", "That being said, this fiscal year quarter has seen that rapid increase slow down compared to recent quarters.", "Q3 2018 also saw NVIDIA put $462 million to research and development, up from $373 million in Q3 2017.", "For Q4 2018, NVIDIA looks to set a record year in 2017, expecting total Q4 revenue between $2.59 and $2.70 billion, coupled with gross margins between 59.2% and 60.2%.", "Nvidia's valuation is absurdly high, good time for them to buy someone like AMD or Mediatek.ViRGE - Friday, November 10, 2017 - link", "NVIDIA doesn't really need AMD's GPU business, and I dare say they likely don't want the semi-custom business either since it's so low margin.", "The only reason to buy AMD would be the CPU business.

However, lack of adequate options for 5G modem suppliers and lack of confidence in Intel could put pressure on Apple to reach a settlement with Qualcomm.", "Qualcomm’s estimated growth on earnings and cash flow suggests that their royalty revenue should grow along with the overall smartphone market, since it has a leading market share position in 4G LTE chipsets and relationships with every prominent smartphone maker.", "Thank you so much for taking the time to go through these.", "Do you have a preference on whether questions are asked on your blog comments or on the RFD forums?", "I am looking at a few Canadian companies but they all seem a bit overpriced. I would appreciate your thoughts.", "Apologies for the delay in replying, I was out of the country on vacation and my Internet access was limited.", "No preferences whether questions are asked here or on RFD forums, I encourage every channel for a good discussion!", "Give me a few days, I will run the charts later and will reply back here.

I look to measure valuation by taking operating cash flow into account.", "Considering their current projects, IMO is fairly valued in my opinion:", "X: Price seems to consistently follow earnings, so It seems a bit overvalued now:", "AEM: Precious Metals companies are evaluated using other metrics, and since there are so many factors outside of the business competence that drives stock price, I’m not comfortable investing in this kind of industry.", "At a glance, AEM seems to follow cash flow, and if the projected cash flow materializes, there’s a good room potential for growth:", "TIH: Good growth company, but it looks overvalued considering the projected their earnings growth, which is estimated to slow down for the next years, compared to their recent growth:", "AGI: Another mining sector company, which I find very difficult to evaluate. It seems to be undervalued compared to cash flow, but these companies usually require other metrics to plot an accurate picture for valuation.", "In any case, it seems to have a good growth potential considering the projected cash flow – if that cash flow growth materializes:", "CSU: This company also meets my quality criteria, but I consider CSU presently overvalued, from both earnings and operating cash flow perspective:"]}

United States to challenge convictions under the FCPA and other statutes.", "For the DOJ, however, the third quarter was likely a period of \"quiet before the storm,\" as the DOJ was preparing for the six FCPA-related trials on the calendar for the current fourth quarter (many of which have recently concluded, as discussed below).", "Additionally, three known DOJ and SEC corporate investigations closed without enforcement action. Overall, the corporate enforcement actions resulted in penalties and disgorgement of nearly $80 million, which is a relatively modest amount given the number of resolutions (for example, in the third quarter of 2018, the total penalties and discouragement were nearly $2 billion; however, nearly $1.8 billion of that amount was attributable to the Petrobras FCPA resolution).", "This trend is consistent with the fact that many of the resolutions in Q3 2019 were civil resolutions by the SEC for violations of the FCPA's accounting provisions alone.", "Since the close of 2019's third quarter, there have been a number of significant FCPA developments, especially on the DOJ side.", "We quickly summarize them here but note that we will discuss them in greater detail in the FCPA Winter Review 2020.", "For example, on October 30, 2019, the DOJ announced that two former senior executives at Monaco-based Unaoil, the former CEO and the former Chief Operations Officer, together with a former business development manager at the company, had pleaded guilty in March 2019 and August 2018, respectively, each to one count of conspiracy to violate the FCPA.", "These guilty pleas are linked to a large number of resolutions and investigations of companies and executives who employed Unaoil as an agent, including the TechnipFMC resolution with the SEC discussed below.", "On the same day (October 30, 2019), the DOJ reached a settlement of its civil forfeiture cases to recover more than $700 million in assets that had been acquired by Low Taek Jho and his family using funds allegedly misappropriated from 1Malaysia Development Berhad (1MDB), Malaysia's investment development fund.", "As indicated above, the DOJ had six FCPA trials scheduled for the fall. On October 11, 2019, Frank Roberto Chatburn Ripalda pleaded guilty to a money laundering conspiracy for his role in using the U.S financial system to launder money to promote violations of the FCPA and Ecuadorian bribery law, thus avoiding the trial that had been scheduled to begin on October 15.", "In November 2019, the DOJ had three high-profile trials, including two convictions with deliberations scheduled to resume after the Thanksgiving holiday .", "On November 8, 2019, a jury in Connecticut convicted Lawrence Hoskins – a former Alstom executive – of six counts of violating the FCPA, three counts of money laundering, and two counts of conspiracy.", "On November 22, 2019, a jury in Maryland convicted Mark Lambert, the former president of Transportation Logistics, Inc., of participating in a scheme to bribe a Russian official to secure contracts for his company to transport uranium to and from Russia.", "On December 2, 2019, a jury in Brooklyn, New York, acquitted Jean Boustani of charges related to allegations that he had defrauded U.S. investors involving $2 billion in loans for Mozambican government projects, through various bribes and kickbacks.", "As indicated, we plan to discuss each of these resolutions or trials in the forthcoming Winter Review in the new year.", "Before returning to third quarter developments, we also note that on November 20, 2019, the DOJ implemented a subtle change to its FCPA Corporate Enforcement Policy (Policy), which offers companies the presumption that the DOJ will decline prosecution if they self-report foreign bribery, fully cooperate with a subsequent government investigation, and remediate the compliance failures.", "Specifically, the DOJ clarified certain of its expectations from companies under the Policy when they self-report foreign bribery and seek to cooperate with the DOJ that may not have been apparent in the previous language.", "The first chart presented below shows that announced dispositions by the DOJ and SEC through three quarters of 2019 are already on par with most prior years – except the record years of 2010 and 2016 – with regard to both corporate and individual resolutions.", "It is unlikely that the 2019 statistics as a whole will rival those from 2010 or 2016, but these numbers show that the DOJ and SEC both remain committed to aggressive enforcement of the FCPA.", "The second chart shows the largest corporate resolutions – based on total corporate settlement amounts in the resolution papers – during the Trump administration, and again this chart shows that the DOJ and SEC continue to collect large amounts in penalties, fines, disgorgement, and more, based on FCPA and related law violations.", "We summarize this quarter's corporate enforcement actions, individual enforcement actions, investigations closed without enforcement, and other policy, litigation, and international developments below.", "During the third quarter of 2019, there were some DOJ-SEC joint resolutions, but also a large number of SEC-only resolutions during the quarter – thus, all of the resolutions this quarter involved issuers.", "- Microsoft Corporation. On July 22, 2019, the SEC announced that Microsoft Corporation (Microsoft), a U.S. issuer, consented to a Cease-and-Desist Order (Order) with the SEC and agreed to pay more than $16 million to resolve charges that it had violated the books-and-records and internal-accounting-controls provisions of the FCPA with improper conduct by the company's wholly-owned subsidiaries in Hungary, Saudi Arabia, Thailand, and Turkey.", "On the same day, the DOJ announced that a Hungarian subsidiary entered into a Non-Prosecution Agreement (NPA) for willingly and knowingly causing Microsoft to falsely record and maintain inaccurate books, records, and accounts by incorrectly recording amounts disguised as discounts that were in fact used to fund improper payments under the FCPA.", "Under the terms of the NPA, Microsoft's Hungarian subsidiary agreed to pay a criminal penalty of $8.7 million, bringing the DOJ-SEC combined total payments to $25.3 million.", "The NPA further stated that Microsoft failed to \"exercise meaningful oversight…to ensure that discounts that Microsoft approved were passed on to [Microsoft] Hungary's end customers instead of being used to facilitate\" a corrupt scheme and that \"[a]lthough this failure of oversight at Microsoft did not amount to a criminal violation by the parent company\" the DOJ viewed it as \"a discretionary factor\" that the DOJ considered when entering into an agreement with Microsoft Hungary.", "We discuss the Microsoft enforcement actions in greater detail below.", "- Deutsche Bank AG. On August 22, 2019, the SEC announced that it had entered a Cease-and-Desist Order (Order) against Deutsche Bank AG (Deutsche Bank), marking, along with the Barclays resolution discussed below, the latest enforcement actions arising out of SEC's investigations into the hiring of so-called \"princelings\" (i.e., relatives of senior government officials) by financial services companies.", "Focusing on the bank's efforts to win business in the Asia Pacific region and Russia, the SEC found that Deutsche Bank had violated the books-and-records and internal-accounting-controls provisions of the FCPA.", "Pursuant to the Order, Deutsche Bank agreed to pay disgorgement of almost $11 million, prejudgment interest of $2.4 million, and a $3 million civil penalty.", "According to the SEC, the settlement reflected Deutsche Bank's cooperation and remediation, including sharing factual findings developed during the internal investigation and remedial measures that Deutsche Bank put into place, such as enhancements to its compliance program and internal accounting controls.", "We discuss the Deutsche Bank enforcement action in greater detail in the next section.", "- Juniper Networks, Inc. On August 29, 2019, the SEC announced that it had entered a Cease-and-Desist Order (Order) against Juniper Networks, Inc. (Juniper), a California-based networking and cybersecurity solutions provider, in connection with violations of the FCPA.", "According to the Order, from 2008 through 2013, sales employees of JNN Development Corp. (JNN), Juniper's subsidiary in Russia, secretly agreed with third-party distributors to fund leisure trips for customers, including government officials, through the use of off-book accounts, and that Juniper's initial efforts to remediate the situation were ineffective.", "The SEC also found that from 2009 through 2013, sales employees of Juniper's subsidiaries in China had falsified trip and meeting agendas for customer events to understate the true amount of entertainment involved in the trips, which, in contravention of Juniper's travel policies, Juniper's legal department had approved without adequate review and after they had already taken place.", "Pursuant to the SEC's Order, Juniper agreed to resolve charges that it had violated the internal-accounting-controls and recordkeeping provisions of the FCPA and pay more than $11.7 million in monetary relief, including $4 million in disgorgement, $1.25 million in prejudgment interest, and a $6.5 million civil penalty.", "We discuss the Juniper settlement in greater detail below.", "- TechnipFMC. On September 19, 2019, the SEC announced that it had issued a Cease-and-Desist Order (Order) against TechnipFMC plc (TFMC), a global oil and gas services provider, to resolve FCPA charges involving conduct in Iraq by FMC Technologies, Inc. (FMC) prior to its merger with Technip S.A. (Technip) in 2017.", "The SEC resolution follows TFMC's earlier resolution with the DOJ in June 2019 on the same facts, as well as conduct by Technip in Brazil to pay bribes to Brazilian officials, including at the country's state-controlled oil-and-gas company Petrobras, and a scheme by FMC to pay bribes to officials in Iraq, which we discussed in detail in our FCPA Summer Review 2019.", "The SEC's Order charges TFMC, as a successor in interest for FMC, with violations of the anti-bribery, books-and-records, and internal-accounting-controls provisions of the FCPA.", "Specifically, the SEC found that from at least 2008 through 2013 FMC paid almost $800,000 to a third-party consultant, which then used part of the funds to bribe Iraqi government officials to procure business with Iraq state-owned oil companies.", "According to the Order, FMC paid the consultant without evidence of services rendered, allowed the consultant to use subagents and success-fee-based compensation without adequate due diligence, and falsely characterized the payments in its books and records.", "The Order also found that FMC \"failed to properly assess and manage its anti-corruption risks in Iraq, and devoted insufficient resources to compliance\" regarding its business in Iraq.", "Pursuant to the Order, TFMC agreed to pay more than $5 million in disgorgement and prejudgment interest and to self-report to the SEC on its compliance program for three years.", "We discuss the TFMC settlement with the SEC in greater detail in the next section.", "- Quad/Graphics. On September 26, 2019, the SEC announced that it had entered a Cease-and-Desist Order (Order) against Quad/Graphics, Inc. (Quad), a Wisconsin-based provider of digital and print marketing services, to resolve charges that it had violated the anti-bribery, books-and-records, and internal-accounting-controls provisions of the FCPA.", "The SEC found that from at least 2011 to January 2016, Quad/Graphics Peru S.A. (Quad Peru), Quad's subsidiary in Peru, paid or promised bribes to Peruvian government officials to secure sales contracts and tried to improperly influence the outcome of a dispute with the Peruvian tax authorities, which had imposed over $12 million in value-added tax, interest, penalties, and fines.", "Quad Peru also created false records to conceal transactions with a state-controlled Cuban telecom, which was subject to U.S. sanctions and exports controls laws.", "The Order further found that from 2010 to 2015, Quad/Tech Shanghai Trading Company (Quad/Tech China), Quad's subsidiary in China, used sham sales agents to make or promise approximately $182,000 in improper payments to employees of private and government customers to secure business.", "According to the SEC, Quad failed to ensure that its internal accounting controls were sufficient to prevent the bribery in Peru and China and the concealment of the sales in Cuba.", "Pursuant to the Order, Quad agreed to pay nearly $10 million in total monetary relief, including nearly $7 million in disgorgement, nearly $1 million in prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty of $2 million.", "Earlier, on September 19, 2019, Quad received a letter from the DOJ, in which the DOJ stated that, consistent with the FCPA Corporate Enforcement Policy, it declined prosecution of the company for violations of the FCPA.", "According to the letter, the DOJ \"ha[s] reached this conclusion despite the bribery committed by employees of the Company's subsidiaries in Peru and China.\"", "We discuss the Quad/Graphics enforcement action in greater detail below.", "- Barclays Bank Plc. On September 27, 2019, the SEC announced that Barclays Plc (Barclays or the Bank) agreed to settle charges that it had violated the FCPA's books-and-records and internal-accounting-controls provisions, when Barclays' Asia Pacific (APAC) region hired relatives and friends of foreign government officials to improperly influence them in connection with the Bank's investment banking business in the APAC region.", "According to the SEC's Cease-and-Desist Order (Order), between 2009 and 2013, Barclays' APAC hired approximately 117 job candidates referred by or connected to government officials or executives of the Bank's non-government clients, with some of the employment offers made as a personal benefit to those officials and executives with the expectation that the Bank would obtain or retain investment banking business.", "Pursuant to the Order, Barclays agreed to pay more than $6 million in disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty.", "We discuss the Barclays Bank enforcement action in greater detail in the next section.", "- Westport Fuels. In another press release on September 27, 2019, the SEC announced that Westport Fuels Systems, Inc. (Westport), a Vancouver, Canada-based clean fuel technology company, and Nancy Gougarty, its former CEO, had agreed to pay more than $4.1 million combined to resolve charges that they had violated the anti-bribery, books-and-records and internal-accounting-controls provisions of the FCPA.", "According to SEC's Cease-and-Desist Order (Order), Westport, acting through Gougarty and others, engaged in a scheme to bribe a Chinese government official to obtain business and a cash dividend payment from a joint venture (JV) between Westport and the state-owned enterprise (SOE) that employed the relevant government official (the Chinese SOE had a controlling stake in the JV).", "In exchange for a transfer of shares of stock in Westport's Chinese JV at a reduced rate to a Chinese private equity fund in which the official held a beneficial interest, Westport and Gougarty believed that the government official would influence the JV to authorize a dividend payment of $3.5 million to Westport and to execute a framework supply agreement between Westport and the JV.", "Westport agreed to pay $2.5 million in disgorgement and prejudgment interest and a civil penalty of $1.5 million, while Westport's former CEO agreed to pay a civil penalty of $120,000.", "We discuss the Westport Fuels enforcement action in greater detail below.", "The chart below shows an update on known investigations by industry over the last ten years. It shows that industries that have historically attracted FCPA enforcement attention continue to do so in the current environment.", "This is partly due to inherent risks in some sectors that feature heavy government regulation or the involvement of state actors in transactions, and likely in part caused by the nature of investigations, which often focus on multiple companies implicated in the same or similar behaviors.", "Below we summarize recent developments related to individual enforcement actions that either occurred during the third quarter or were reported in the third quarter, including appellate victories for the DOJ, sentencings for six individuals, three guilty pleas, and two individuals reaching settlements with the SEC (although one settlement involving Westport's former CEO is summarized above).", "- On August 5, 2019, the Second Circuit Court of Appeals upheld the convictions of Macau, China-based billionaire real estate developer Ng Lap Seng and the former Guinean mining minister Mahmoud Thiam.", "As discussed in greater detail in our FCPA Autumn Review 2017, a federal jury had found Ng guilty in 2017 of paying approximately $1.3 million in bribes to two former U.N. officials in exchange for U.N. support for a multi-billion-dollar conference center he planned to construct in Macau.", "Thiam, on the other hand, had been convicted in 2017 by a New York federal jury for laundering $8.5 million in bribes he had received in exchange for valuable mineral mining rights in violation of U.S. money laundering statues and Guinea's bribery law.", "During his trial and on appeal, Ng argued that McDonnell's narrow interpretation of the term \"official act\" in the U.S. domestic bribery statute should also apply to the FCPA and the federal program bribery statute.", "Specifically, Ng argued that the DOJ failed to prove that the bribes he paid resulted in any \"official acts\" by the former U.N. officials, and that the jury was not properly instructed that an \"official act\" was required to fulfill the \"quid pro quo\" elements of the FCPA and the federal program bribery statute.", "The Court rejected Ng's appeal and declined to extend McDonnell to other anti-corruption and fraud statutes.", "The Second Circuit rejected a similar appeal from Thiam, who had tried to apply McDonnell to Guinea's anti-bribery law, which had been used as the basis for the money laundering charge against him.", "The Second Circuit panel disagreed, ruling that principles of international comity weigh against applying McDonnell's definition of an \"official act\" to Guinean law.", "- On April 12, 2019, Jose Luis de la Paz Roman (Roman) was sentenced to 36 months in prison for his role in a conspiracy to make bribe payments to officials at PetroEcuador, the state-owned and state-controlled oil company of Ecuador.", "Although Roman's sentence was imposed on April 10, 2019 and entered into the docket two days later, the case did not get reported until August 2019.", "- On June 26, 2019, Julia Vivi Wang (Wang), a naturalized U.S. citizen born in China and a former executive of South-South News, a media group that promoted U.N. development goals, was sentenced to three years of supervised release and restitution of $629,295 after she had pleaded guilty in April 2018 to one count of conspiracy to violate the FCPA, one count of violating the FCPA, and one count of submitting fraudulent tax returns in which she failed to report to the IRS a total of approximately $2 million in income from 2010 to 2013.", "In April 2013, Wang wired $500,000 to John Ashe who, before leading the U.N. General Assembly between late 2013 and September 2014, had served as the Permanent Representative of Antigua and Barbuda to the U.N.", "In exchange for the bribe, Wang sought to obtain a diplomatic position for herself or her late husband with the government of Antigua.", "- On July 22, 2019, in two separate hearings, James Finley, a British citizen and a former senior Rolls-Royce executive, and Andreas Kohler, an Austrian citizen and a former managing director at an engineering firm, were each sentenced to four months of imprisonment in connection with a scheme to bribe Kazakh and Chinese officials.", "As part of their sentences, Finley and Kohler also received eight and four months of home confinement and were required to pay fines of $500,000 and $72,000, respectively.", "- On July 31, 2019 and August 21, 2019, respectively, Enrique Pinto Franceschi (Pinto), a former sales representative of a Miami-based equipment supplier to Venezuela's state-owned energy company Petróleos de Venezuela S.A. (PDVSA), and Franz Herman Muller Huber (Muller), the president of the same supplier, each pleaded guilty to two counts – conspiracy to violate the FCPA and conspiracy to commit wire fraud.", "Pinto and Muller were both Venezuelan nationals residing in the United States. They had been charged on February 21, 2019 in a five-count indictment in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Texas, including conspiracy to violate the FCPA, conspiracy to commit wire fraud, wire fraud, and conspiracy to launder money, for their alleged roles in a scheme to corruptly secure contracts and other business advantages from PDVSA.", "- In related proceedings, on August 28, 2019, Moises Abraham Millan Escobar (Millan), a former employee of a Venezuelan businessman, Abraham Jose Shiera Bastidas (Shiera), was sentenced in the Southern District of Texas to three years' probation and fined $15,000 for his role in an alleged scheme to bribe three PDVSA officials.", "In January 2016, Millan had pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy to violate the FCPA and agreed to forfeit proceeds from the bribery scheme amounting to more than $533,000.", "Shiera had been charged in December 2015 and pleaded guilty in March 2016 for violating the FCPA by bribing the three Venezuelan officials to secure energy contracts.", "A day later, on August 29, 2019, a former employee of PDVSA, Jose Luis Ramos-Castillo, received an 18-month-long sentence, two years of supervised release, and a fine of $15,000 for accepting bribes in exchange to assisting companies in winning energy contracts with PDVSA and for conspiracy to commit money laundering.", "- On September 13, 2019, the SEC resolved civil FCPA charges against Sridhar Thiruvengadam, a former Chief Operating Officer of New Jersey-based technology-related outsourcing services provider Cognizant Technology Solutions Corporation (Cognizant), that he had violated the FCPA by participating in a scheme with three other Cognizant executives to bribe an Indian government official on behalf of the company.", "According to the Cease-and-Desist Order, the $2 million bribery payment was made in response to the official's demand to procure a construction planning permit.", "Thiruvengadam also concealed the true nature of the payment by signing false sub-certifications to the company's management representation letters.", "As part of the settlement, Thiruvengadam paid a penalty of $50,000 and agreed to cooperate with the SEC, as the SEC currently has pending enforcement actions against two other former Cognizant executives.", "- On September 25, 2019, Luis Alberto Chacin Haddad (Chacin) of Miami, Florida, was sentenced to 51 months in federal prison and two years of supervised release for bribing officials at Venezuela's national electricity company in exchange for $60 million in contracts for his companies.", "In June 2019, Chacin had pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy to violate the FCPA. As part of the plea agreement, Chacin forfeited approximately $5.5 million in profits he had made from the corrupt contracts as well as real estate in the Miami area that he had purchased with the proceeds of the bribery scheme.", "Each of these developments is discussed below in more detail.", "For the third quarter of 2019, we have identified the following two investigations that have been closed without enforcement action:", "- Misonix, Inc. (Misonix): We reported in our FCPA Summer Review 2019 that on June 18, 2019, Misonix had received a letter from the SEC stating the SEC did not intend to recommend an enforcement action against Misonix.", "On August 16, 2019, Misonix publicly disclosed in its Form 8-K that the company had received two days earlier a letter from the DOJ, dated August 13, 2019, stating that DOJ had closed its inquiry into Misonix without any action.", "- Ciena Corp. (Ciena): On September 11, 2019, Ciena disclosed in its Quarterly Report that the SEC had closed its FCPA investigation into potentially improper payments to an individual employed by one of Ciena's customers in the ASEAN region and that the Commission's staff did not intend to recommend any enforcement action by the SEC against the company.", "The DOJ had closed a parallel investigation in December 2018, declining to prosecute the matter.", "On September 9, 2019, SEC Chair Jay Clayton gave a speech to the Economic Club of New York that focused in part of FCPA enforcement issues.", "Among other issues, Mr. Clayton commented that he had not seen \"meaningful improvement\" in efforts by other countries to enforce laws against foreign bribery, citing economic game theory as a possible reason for this perceived lack of effort.", "He thus noted that FCPA enforcement has sometimes placed U.S. companies at a disadvantage in relation to their competitors from countries that do not enforce similar laws.", "Mr. Clayton's speech received media attention in part because of comments critical of certain aspects of FCPA enforcement that he made well before taking his current position as SEC Chair.", "We note that, in the same speech, Mr. Clayton also stated: \"To be clear, I do not intend to change the FCPA enforcement posture of the SEC.\"", "We also note that Mr. Clayton's focus on enforcement activities by other countries has been a consistent theme for U.S. policy since at least the early 1990s, when the United States supported efforts to negotiate international treaties such as the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) Anti-Bribery Convention in an effort to promote enforcement by other countries.", "Indeed, a key aspect of the OECD's ongoing work in this area is testing and critiquing the enforcement efforts of Convention signatories.", "As noted above, on November 20, 2019, the DOJ slightly changed its FCPA Corporate Enforcement Policy.", "Companies were previously required under the Policy to \"disclose all relevant facts known to [them]\" to qualify for voluntary disclosure credit under the Policy.", "Recognizing that the previous language may have been confusing and may have created a disincentive for companies to come forward with information about wrongdoing, companies are now expected to disclose \"all relevant facts known to [them] at the time of the disclosure, including as to any individuals substantially involved\" in the misconduct.", "Another change to the Policy relates to proactive cooperation, with the updated policy now stating that companies must inform the DOJ \"where the company is aware of relevant evidence not in the company's possession.\"", "In contrast, the Policy previously required companies to inform the DOJ \"where the company is or should be aware of opportunities for the Department to obtain relevant evidence not in the company's possession and not otherwise known to the Department.\"", "Similar to the tweak to the self-reporting requirement, the change to the cooperation language potentially makes this requirement less onerous and comes after the DOJ has realized that the language was potentially ambiguous, likely creating confusion about what a company \"should\" be doing or looking for in order to satisfy the proactive cooperation requirement.", "Finally, this quarter saw several significant anti-corruption developments outside of the United States, with several corporate enforcement actions and one individual enforcement action that ended in a conviction and confiscation order.", "In Brazil, Camargo Correa entered into a leniency agreement with the Controller General and the Attorney General of Brazil, agreeing to pay approximately $339 million in connection with bribery and price fixing-related conduct that the company had admitted to in a previous settlement with the Brazilian authorities in July 2015.", "Also in Brazil, EcoRovias settled corruption and money laundering allegations related to road concession contracts.", "EcoRovias agreed to pay approximately $100 million as part of the agreement with Brazil's Federal Prosecution Service and obtain an independent compliance monitor for 32 months, the first Brazil-only compliance monitorship.", "Another corporate enforcement action in Brazil was Odebrecht's Negotiated Resolution Agreement (Agreement) with the Inter-Development Bank Group (IDB) following an investigation by IDB's Office of Institutional Integrity.", "The Agreement covered two of Odebrecht's subsidiaries, CNO S.A. and OEC S.A., and resulted, among other disciplinary actions, in CNO's (but excluding its African branches) six-year debarment from participating in any IDB-financed projects.", "And in the United Kingdom, the Serious Fraud Office (SFO) obtained a confiscation order in September 2019 against Peter Chapman, the former manager of Innovia Securency PTY Ltd. (Securency), requiring him to pay approximately $545,000 as repayment of the benefits of bribes he had paid to government agents.", "An earlier five-week trial in 2015 had resulted in Chapman's conviction on four counts of making corrupt payments and acquittal on two.", "Finding that he had paid more than $205,000 to an agent of Nigerian Security Printing and Mining PLC in exchange for contracts with Securency, the court sentenced him to 30 months in prison.", "The SFO also completed a DPA with Serco Geografix Ltd., which had in 2013 reached a civil settlement with the U.K.'s Ministry of Justice related to fraud and false accounting in connection with electronic monitoring contracts.", "We discuss the Camargo Correa leniency agreement, EcoRovias's settlement, Odebrecht's Negotiated Resolution Agreement, SFO's confiscation order against Securency's former manager, and SFO's DPA with Serco Geografix in greater detail below.", "Microsoft Corporation and Its Hungarian Subsidiary Settle Criminal and Civil Charges Related to Conduct in Hungary, Saudi Arabia, Thailand, and Turkey", "On July 22, 2019, Microsoft Corporation (Microsoft), a global provider of technology and software solutions headquartered in Redmond, Washington, and its direct, wholly-owned Hungary-based subsidiary, Microsoft Magyarország Számítástechnikai Szolgáltató és", "Kereskedelmi Kft. (Microsoft Hungary), resolved civil and criminal charges with the SEC and DOJ, respectively.", "Microsoft consented to a Cease-and-Desist Order (Order) with the SEC to resolve charges that it had violated the books-and-records and internal-accounting-controls provisions of the FCPA.", "On the same day, Microsoft Hungary reached a Non-Prosecution Agreement (NPA) with the DOJ for willingly and knowingly causing Microsoft, a U.S. issuer, to falsely record and maintain inaccurate books, records, and accounts by incorrectly recording amounts disguised as discounts used to fund improper payments under the FCPA.", "The NPA stated that Microsoft failed to \"exercise meaningful oversight…to ensure that discounts that Microsoft approved were passed on to [Microsoft] Hungary's end customers instead of being used to facilitate\" a corrupt scheme and that \"[a]lthough this failure of oversight at Microsoft did not amount to a criminal violation by the parent company\" the DOJ viewed it as \"a discretionary factor\" that the DOJ considered when entering into an agreement with Microsoft Hungary.", "As a result of the SEC's Order and DOJ's NPA, Microsoft and Microsoft Hungary agreed to pay $25.3 million in penalties, disgorgement, and prejudgment interest.", "Microsoft's stock is registered pursuant to Section 12(b) of the Exchange Act is and publicly-traded on the NASDAQ, making it an \"issuer\" under the FCPA.", "The financial results of Microsoft's wholly-owned foreign subsidiaries, including those in Hungary, Saudi Arabia, Thailand, and Turkey, are ultimately consolidated into Microsoft's financial statements.", "The allegations described in the Order cover conduct related to the operations of Microsoft's foreign-based wholly-owned subsidiaries in four markets—Hungary, Saudi Arabia, Thailand, and Turkey—while the DOJ NPA relates only to conduct in Hungary (which overlaps with the Hungary-based conduct discussed in the Order).", "The violations set forth in the Order include the following:", "- Hungary: The SEC Order covers two distinct schemes in Hungary—one related to inflated discounts in connection with licensing transactions, and the other related to unjustified consulting service engagements.", "- Licensing Transactions. First, in 2014 and 2015, the SEC Order states that Microsoft Hungary employees requested \"excessive discounts,\" using false or \"vague justifications,\" including \"competition with other bidders, end customer price sensitivity, and the possibility of winning related services contracts.\"", "The discounts were approved by Microsoft's Business Desk—a group managed by Microsoft personnel in Redmond, Washington with employees around the world responsible for approving discounts above certain thresholds.", "However, according to the Order, there was no process to determine if discount requests were legitimate, and Microsoft lacked visibility into whether the end customer would be the ultimate beneficiary of the approved discounts.", "In two examples described in the SEC Order, Microsoft Ireland Operations Limited (MIOL), an indirect wholly-owned Microsoft subsidiary, sold software licenses to approved distributor and/or third-party resellers called Licensing Solution Partners (LSPs) at heavily discounted rates.", "In one instance, MIOL sold licenses to an LSP that did not bid on the tender at issue. As a result, that LSP resold the licensing rights to another LSP, which resold the licensing rights to the end-government customer without passing on the full discount amount.", "In another instance, MIOL sold the licenses to an LSP that resold them to a non-approved third party.", "Again, the third party did not pass on the full discount amount to the end customer. In both cases, the SEC Order states that a portion of the \"discount\" not passed on to the end customer was used to pay government officials to allegedly influence the transactions.", "In turn, according to the SEC Order, the amounts paid to government officials to win business were improperly recorded in Microsoft Hungary's books and records, which were consolidated into Microsoft's financials.", "As a result of improper payments to government officials connected to the licensing transactions, the SEC Order alleged that Microsoft received $13,780,733 in business.", "- Consulting Service Engagements. In addition, in 2014 and 2015, Microsoft Hungary contracted third parties in connection with consulting service engagements that Microsoft Hungary had entered into with government customers in Hungary.", "In certain instances, there was minimal, if any, evidence supporting the nature of the services provided by the third parties.", "Also, the SEC Order notes that Microsoft Hungary employees and third-party employees falsely recorded supposed work performed on various service engagements in Microsoft's timekeeping system.", "In one instance, Microsoft failed to conduct due diligence on a third party that was hired upon request by a government customer.", "In another instance, Microsoft Hungary contracted a third-party entity that used a government employee to provide services—Microsoft failed to conduct due diligence on both parties.", "The purported services provided were incorrectly recorded as legitimate transactions in Microsoft Hungary's books and records.", "- Saudi Arabia: From 2012 through 2014, according to the Order, employees in Microsoft's indirect, wholly-owned subsidiary Microsoft Arabia (Microsoft Saudi Arabia) funneled at least $440,000 intended to be used for marketing expenses and business proposals to a \"slush fund.\"", "The SEC Order states that the slush fund was used to cover travel expenses for seven Saudi government employees as well as for gifts, furniture, electronics, and other equipment for government agencies.", "Microsoft Saudi Arabia funded the slush fund through \"larger than usual discounts\" as well as through payment to four third parties—two vendors and two LSPs.", "Two of Microsoft Saudi Arabia's vendors managed the fund and disbursed payments at the direction of Microsoft Saudi Arabia employees; the SEC Order alleges that the vendors received approximately $130,000 in commissions and service fees for maintaining the fund.", "According to the SEC Order, Microsoft's records did not accurately reflect the total amount and use of the funds.", "- Thailand: From January 2013 through April 2015, the Order alleges that an employee at Microsoft's indirect, wholly-owned subsidiary Microsoft Thailand Ltd. (Microsoft Thailand) and a Microsoft Thailand LSP employee provided at least $100,000 in gifts and travel benefits to employees of a non-government banking customers.", "Specifically, the SEC Order states the Microsoft Thailand LSP established an account funded through discounts provided by Microsoft and funds intended for end-customer training.", "Instead, the individuals used the funds to purchase technology equipment and pay for travel for employees of Microsoft Thailand's non-government end customers.", "To cover up the scheme, the Microsoft Thailand employee directed the Microsoft Thailand LSP employee to submit false purchase orders to Microsoft Thailand's training vendors.", "In turn, the vendors would submit an invoice in connection with the purchase order that was paid from an account managed by the LSP that was intended for training.", "Similar to conduct in Saudi Arabia, the vendors were compensated for their role in the scheme.", "- Turkey: In July 2014, executives from Microsoft's indirect, wholly-owned subsidiary Bilgisayar Yazilim Hizmetleri Limited Sirketi (Microsoft Turkey) approved an \"excessive discount\" in connection with a public tender issued by Turkey's Ministry of Culture for Microsoft licenses and services.", "The tender was awarded to an unauthorized third party, a \"system integrator.\" As a result, a Microsoft Turkey employee directed an authorized LSP to work on the transaction with the system integrator and did not disclose the system integrator's role in the transaction.", "The Microsoft Turkey employee negotiated the payment terms between the system integrator and the LSP and Microsoft Turkey authorized a seven percent discount over the standard discount.", "According to the Order, \"Microsoft's records do not reflect what services, if any, the system integrator provided, and the authorized reseller informed Microsoft that it provided the services on the transaction.", "Moreover, there is no evidence the additional discount was passed on to the government customer.\" As a result, the Order notes that Microsoft violated the internal-accounting-controls and books-and-records provisions of the FCPA.", "The DOJ NPA covers Microsoft Hungary's scheme related to creating inflated margins associated with certain licensing deals that it entered into with government customers (which overlaps with the first of the two Hungary-related schemes summarized by the SEC above).", "Specifically, from approximately 2013 to June 2015, an executive at Microsoft Hungary and other employees falsely told Microsoft that discounts were necessary to close deals with government customers.", "Once discounts were approved, they were not fully passed on to the government customers and were instead used to improperly compensate government officials who played a role in the sale of Microsoft software to the Hungarian government agencies.", "As a result, the NPA states that Microsoft Hungary knowingly and willfully caused Microsoft to record false discounts in its books and records.", "According to the NPA the licensing deals that led to the false reporting of discounts resulted in USD $14,586,325 in profits for Microsoft Hungary.", "In connection with its NPA with the DOJ, Microsoft Hungary agreed to pay a criminal penalty of $8,751,795.", "In calculating the penalty amount, the NPA notes that the DOJ applied a 25 percent discount off the bottom of the Guidelines fine range – the maximum discount allowable for companies that did not voluntarily disclose the misconduct – as a result of the company's cooperation and remediation.", "The SEC did not impose a civil penalty in addition to the criminal penalty resulting from Microsoft Hungary's NPA with the DOJ.", "However, it ordered Microsoft to pay disgorgement of $13,780,733 and prejudgment interest of $2,784,417.92.", "- Cooperation and Foreign Data Privacy Laws: In the NPA, the DOJ noted that despite not receiving voluntary disclosure credit, Microsoft Hungary received full cooperation credit including for \"producing documents to the Fraud Section and the Office from foreign countries in ways that did not implicate foreign data privacy laws (emphasis added).\"", "This language has appeared in several recent settlement agreements (see e.g., Walmart, TechnipUSA, Fresenius, Credit Suisse) and affirms that the DOJ is aware of the complex challenges raised by these laws, that prosecutors expect companies in a cooperative posture to find solutions to get relevant information to investigators despite the presence of such laws, and that the DOJ rewards companies that do so.", "- Importance of Visibility in Discount Process: Various past FCPA enforcement actions involve schemes whereby inflated margins from discounts were used to facilitate improper payments to officials (see e.g., Polycom, Orthofix, General Cable, SAP, Mead Johnson, Weatherford International, Eli Lilly, Pfizer, Smith & Nephew, and Daimler).", "Moreover, as noted below, another resolution this quarter for Juniper Networks also included inflated discounts to third parties that did not relay the discount to the ultimate customer.", "According to the DOJ's NPA, Microsoft had in place procedures to \"ensure consistency in Microsoft pricing and to avoid improper use of discounts by sales personnel\" and a specific unit—the Microsoft Business Desk—responsible for reviewing requests for larger-than-normal discounts to ensure appropriate factors were considered before approving certain discounts.", "Indeed, in one of the schemes described in the NPA, the Microsoft Business Desk initially rejected a discount request because the estimated reseller margin was deemed too high.", "However, as demonstrated by this settlement, processes to review and approve discounts at the initial stages of a transaction may not be sufficient to effectively address risks.", "Rigorous business justification and documentation requirements throughout the life of a transaction, targeted training that enables reviewers to spot red flags, and assertive auditing processes are additional tools that companies should consider using to limit employees' ability to fund \"off the books\" schemes and to deter other conduct that can create risks for companies, such as revenue recognition and related financial reporting issues.", "- Data Analytics for Identifying High-Risk Transactions: In the NPA, the DOJ summarized \"extensive remedial measures\" by both Microsoft and Microsoft Hungary.", "Among the standard list was a measure that has seen increasing use in the compliance space -- the two companies had \"develop[ed] and us[ed] data analytics to help identify high-risk transactions.\"", "Prior to the NPA with Microsoft Hungary, the DOJ had issued guidance to prosecutors, suggesting that they ask companies, \"What information or metrics has the company collected and used to help detect the type of misconduct in question?", "How have the information or metrics informed the compliance program?\" Since this resolution, DOJ prosecutors have had public comments on the importance of data analytics in compliance programs.", "In September 2019, the DOJ said that data analytics are \"an area of focus,\" which would soon be used across the board in compliance, according to both the DOJ and SEC.", "The SEC views the use of data analytics by companies positively, calling it \"absolutely a good thing,\" and expects that companies will eventually have an analytics program as the technology develops.", "For its part, the DOJ said in November 2019 that various factors would determine whether or how companies use data analytics but \"it can be helpful.\"", "- Scope of SEC Cease-and-Desist Order Versus Scope of Disgorgement Amount: It is noteworthy that the SEC Cease-and-Desist Order summarizes conduct from four countries, including one country (Thailand) in which the SEC summarized payments to employees of \"non-government banking customers\" without mention of government officials, indicating that the SEC was targeting commercial bribery rather than public bribery.", "At the same time, however, the SEC used only the profits from the business in Hungary in calculating the disgorgement owed by Microsoft.", "Thus, the activity in Thailand, Saudi Arabia, and Turkey did not appear to affect the financial terms of the Cease-and-Desist Order.", "Deutsche Bank Settles Hiring Practice Allegations with the SEC for $16 Million", "On August 22, 2019, the SEC entered a Cease-and-Desist Order (Order) against Deutsche Bank AG (Deutsche Bank) to resolve alleged violations of the books-and-records and internal-accounting-controls provisions of the FCPA.", "Pursuant to the Order, the bank agreed to disgorge $10,785,900, pay $2,392,950 in prejudgment interest, and pay a civil monetary penalty of $3 million.", "In total, Deutsche Bank agreed to pay just over $16 million to resolve the matter with the SEC.", "With shares traded on the NYSE since 2001, Deutsche Bank is a publicly traded, multinational financial services corporation and an \"issuer\" under the FCPA.", "The SEC alleged that between 2006 and 2014, the bank employed the relatives of government officials in an effort to influence the officials and obtain or retain business for the bank.", "By 2009, Deutsche Bank had internal policies which recognized the corruption risks presented by providing employment at the request of clients and government officials, but the SEC stated that the bank did not sufficiently address those risks through effectively implemented global policies and practices until 2015.", "Further, the SEC alleged that Deutsche Bank falsified books and records and failed to maintain sufficient internal accounting controls around its hiring practices \"sufficient to provide reasonable assurances that its employees did not bribe foreign government officials.\"", "The SEC alleged that hires made at the request of government officials in China and Russia generated $10,785,900 in unjust enrichment for the bank.", "The SEC specifically pointed to five alleged hires by Deutsche Bank or its China-based joint venture as supporting this conclusion: the daughter of the chairman of a Chinese state-owned entity (SOE), the son of two SOE executives, the son of the chairman of another Chinese SOE, the daughter of a Deputy Minister at a Russian government entity, and the son of a senior executive at a Russian SOE.", "According to the Cease-and-Desist Order, Deutsche Bank hired these persons at the request of government officials and SOE executives, despite the prospective employees lacking work experience and performing poorly during the admission and interview process.", "According to the SEC's Order, one \"human resource employee stated that … [one of the hires] failed to come to work, cheated on an exam, and was 'a liability to the reputation of the program, if not the firm…'\"", "The settlement reflected Deutsche Bank's cooperation with regulators, which the SEC said included sharing factual findings developed during the bank's internal investigation, as well as remedial measures put into place by the bank, including enhancements to its compliance program and internal accounting controls.", "- Deutsche Bank Held Responsible for Hires by China Joint Venture: Two of the five hires the SEC specifically described in the Cease-and-Desist Order were at least initially made by the China joint venture at the request of the bank.", "In one case, allegedly due to headcount restrictions and because \"the hire request would likely have been rejected by Deutsche Bank human resources and compliance\" functions, Deutsche Bank's Chairman of the Asia-Pacific region (APAC) Corporate Finance and the lead banker for an SOE instructed the joint venture to make the hire.", "The individual was later hired by the bank itself following her request for a transfer. In another case, Deutsche Bank's compliance team allegedly rejected the proposed hire twice because the circumstances were determined to potentially violate the bank's hiring policy.", "Nonetheless, according to the Cease-and-Desist Order, the candidate was hired by the joint venture and Deutsche Bank senior APAC management allowed that person to work on Deutsche Bank business and at the bank, despite knowing compliance had previously rejected the hire.", "- SEC Continues to Investigate Hiring Practices in the Financial Industry: The Deutsche Bank settlement and the Barclays resolution summarized below mark the latest enforcement actions arising out of the SEC's investigation into the hiring of so-called \"princelings,\" a term given to the relatives (usually dependents) of senior government officials by companies in the financial industry.", "As we reported in 2015, a $14.8 million settlement with The Bank of New York Mellon Corp. marked the first official casualty of the SEC's princeling investigation.", "Since then, other banks have settled with the SEC and other agencies over similar allegations, including a 2016 settlement between the DOJ, SEC, Federal Reserve Board, and JPMorgan Securities (Asia Pacific) Limited for a total of approximately $264.4 million in penalties and a 2018 settlement between the DOJ, SEC, and Credit Suisse (Hong Kong) Limited (CSHK) for a total of approximately $76.8 million in penalties.", "Deutsche Bank is the only resolution to include the hiring of children of Russian officials, however.", "Juniper Networks Settles with SEC Over FCPA Allegations in Russia and China", "On August 29, 2019, California networking equipment provider, Juniper Networks (Juniper) agreed to pay more than $11 million in penalties and disgorgement to resolve charges that the company had violated the books-and-records and internal-accounting-controls provisions of the FCPA as a result of certain activities by several of its subsidiaries in Russia and China.", "Juniper is a Delaware incorporated corporation, registered on the New York Stock Exchange, and is thus an \"issuer\" under the FCPA.", "According to the SEC's Cease-and-Desist Order (Order), from 2008 to 2013 certain sales employees from the company's Russian subsidiary, JNN Development Corp. (JNN), entered into an agreement with third party intermediaries known as \"channel partners\" to \"increase the incremental discount on sales made to customers through those channel partners without passing those increased discounts on to customers.\"", "The resulting pool of funds was then used in part to pay for customer trips which had \"little to no educational or business purpose.\"", "The Order also states that from 2009 to 2013 certain sales employees from Juniper's Chinese subsidiaries \"falsified trip and meeting agendas for customer events that understated the true amount of entertainment involved on the trips.\"", "The SEC alleges that Juniper \"failed to accurately record the incremental discounts and travel marketing expenses in its books and records, and failed to devise and maintain a system of internal accounting controls sufficient to prevent and detect off-book accounts, unauthorized customer trips, falsified travel agendas and after-the-fact travel approvals.\"", "The SEC Order states that between 2008 and 2013, certain JNN sales employees in Russia misrepresented the need for \"increased discounts to meet [Juniper's] competition.\"", "The SEC Order alleges that – in fact – these JNN employees \"secretly agreed\" with channel partners that the increased discounts, referred to as \"common funds,\" would be retained by channel partners in off-book accounts rather than passed to the customer.", "According to the SEC Order, JNN employees structured these transactions in this manner \"to keep the common funds off Juniper's books so that local JNN and channel partners could thereafter direct the funds without obtaining proper internal Juniper approvals.\"", "The proceeds were in part used by JNN employees and channel partners to fund customer trips, which the SEC characterized as \"excessive, inconsistent with Juniper policy, predominantly leisure in nature\" and lacking \"any legitimate business purpose.\"", "Examples contained in the SEC's Order include: \"travelling to international tourist destinations, such as Italy, Portugal, and various U.S. cities where there were no Juniper facilities, industry specific conferences or other business justifications.\"", "More specifically, some of these trips also included \"sightseeing tours, [trips to] amusement parks, national park excursions and meal entertainment for customers\" and sometimes customer family members.", "Some of the customers involved in the trips were government officials, according to the Order.", "The SEC noted that former JNN employees discussed \"their desire to have a business impact based on this leisure travel and entertainment.\"", "The Order cites one internal communication seeking approval for a \"five-day international sightseeing trip\", whereby an employee explained that the \"purpose of the trip\" was to meet with a \"top [state-owned customer] manager to speed up Q2 bookings.\"", "In another case, a JNN employee allegedly asked to take a state-owned customer \"on a seven-day leisure trip to the U.S., explaining his belief that if the trip was not approved, Juniper would lose customer sales.\"", "The SEC Order further alleges that in late 2009 a former member of senior management became aware that JNN employees in Russia had created \"off-book accounts that were funded in part by improperly obtained incremental discounts\" both of which were in contravention of Juniper's policies.", "While Juniper instructed JNN employees to discontinue the practices, they nevertheless persisted through 2013.", "Moreover, the SEC notes that the company's \"overall remedial efforts were ineffective\" and consequently, Juniper \"failed to properly account for these off-book funds and failed to implement or maintain a system of effective internal accounting controls to prevent off-book accounts, improper expenses, and the misuse of product discounts.\"", "In China, the SEC Order alleges that between 2009 and 2013, employees of Juniper's Chinese subsidiaries engaged in improper travel practices by funding domestic travel and entertainment of customers, some of whom were foreign officials, \"that was excessive and inconsistent with Juniper policy.\"", "In support of such activities, certain local marketing employees in China falsified agendas for trips provided to customer employees, which understated the extent of the entertainment involved in the trips.", "According to the SEC Order, \"these falsified and misleading trip agendas\" were submitted to Juniper's legal department for approval, though the Order notes that, in other instances, no such approvals were obtained in contravention of company policy.", "The SEC also alleges that marketing employees \"also provided these falsified agendas to their customer invitees to assist the invitees in obtaining their own internal approvals to attend events.\"", "The SEC Order also notes that members of Juniper's legal department \"regularly approved events that had already\" occurred.", "Such actions, according to the SEC, \"[violated] Juniper's policies and undermin[ed] its internal accounting controls over travel and entertainment.\"", "As a result of the conduct described above, the SEC imposed a total fine of $11,745,018 on Juniper, which included $4 million in disgorgement, $1,245,018 in prejudgment interest and a civil penalty in the amount of $6.5 million.", "However, the SEC also recognized Juniper's cooperation which included \"timely disclosure\" of the facts ascertained during the company's internal investigation, voluntary production and translation of documents, and presentations to SEC staff regarding the company's investigation.", "According to the SEC Order, Juniper also took the following remedial actions: \"revisiting its compliance policies and making enhancements to its compliance group…realign[ing]", "its compliance function into an integrated unit\" funneling all reporting into a \"newly created and empowered Chief Compliance Officer…implement[ing] a mandatory escalation police to ensure the Company's Board of Directors is informed of serious issues…institut[ing] a compliance preview and requir[ing] pre-approval of non-standard discounts…requir[ing] pre-approval for third-party gifts, travel, and entertainment, channel partner marketing expenses, and…certain operating expenses in high risk markets.\"", "Finally, the SEC's Order also notes that Juniper conducted \"additional employee training on anti-corruption issues and improved its process for conducting internal investigations of potential violations of anti-corruption laws.\"", "- Risks at the Top: Notably, the SEC Order points to deficiencies in senior management's response, including the company's legal department, in connection with the off-book accounts in Russia and travel and hospitality expenses in China.", "As mentioned above, upon learning that JNN employees in Russia created \"off-book accounts,\" in contravention to company policies, senior management failed to adequately address the issue such that the practices persisted through 2013.", "In China, the SEC Order suggests that Juniper's legal department contributed to the problem by \"regularly approv[ing] events that had already\" occurred.", "In doing so, Juniper's legal department not only violated company policies but also \"undermin[ed] its internal accounting controls over travel and entertainment.\"", "- No DOJ Declination: Juniper's settlement with the SEC comes more than a year after the company disclosed that the DOJ closed its FCPA investigation of the company in a public filing dated February 9, 2018.", "Specifically, according to the company's February 9, 2018 Form 8-K, the DOJ closed its investigation without taking any action against the company, and \"acknowledged the Company's cooperation in the investigation.\"", "In closing the investigation, the DOJ did not identify this decision as a declination.", "TechnipFMC Plc and U.S. Subsidiary Settle with SEC Related to Conduct in Brazil and Iraq", "On September 19, 2019, the SEC issued a Cease-and-Desist Order (Order) against TechnipFMC Plc (TFMC), a global provider of oil and gas services based in Texas, to resolve FCPA charges involving conduct in Brazil and Iraq.", "This Order is issued in connection with the June 25, 2019 DPA that TFMC entered with the DOJ. As noted in our FCPA Summer Review 2019 (which has additional background on the facts at issue), the resolution with the SEC was foreshadowed through the Board resolution attached to the DPA between TFMC and the DOJ.", "The SEC's Order charges TFMC with violations of the anti-bribery, books-and-records, and internal-accounting-controls provisions of the FCPA.", "TFMC is the result of a 2017 merger between Technip S.A. and FMC Technologies, Inc., and as such, TFMC is a successor in interest for both Technip S.A. (Technip) and FMC Technologies, Inc.", "The SEC Order states that TFMC began trading in the United States on January 17, 2017 under FMC Technologies' old ticker, \"FTI.\"", "In connection with its resolution with the SEC, TFMC agreed to pay disgorgement of $4,327,194 and prejudgment interest of $734,712.", "TFMC also agreed to self-reporting to the SEC on its compliance program for a period of three years. Thus, the agreement corresponded to the terms outlined in the board resolution attached to the DPA.", "The SEC did not impose a civil penalty, citing the imposition of a $296,184,000 criminal fine as part of TFMC's resolution with the DOJ.", "For the full summary and analysis of allegations against TFMC, please refer to our previous article in the 2019 Summer Review.", "Printing Services Provider Quad/Graphics Settles with SEC for Books-and-Records and Internal-Accounting-Controls Violations in Peru and China", "On September 26, 2019, the SEC announced a Cease-and-Desist Order (Order) against Quad/Graphics, Inc. (Quad), a marketing solutions and printing services provider headquartered in Sussex, Wisconsin.", "Under the Order, Quad agreed to pay a total of $9,895,334—including disgorgement of $6,936,174, prejudgment interest of $959,160, and a civil penalty of $2,000,000—to resolve charges that it had violated the books-and-records and internal-accounting-controls provisions of the FCPA.", "Approximately one month prior, on September 19, 2019, the DOJ declined to prosecute Quad for the same conduct, formally finding that criminal prosecution was warranted but that the company had met the conditions set forth in the DOJ's FCPA Corporate Enforcement Policy, most notably by voluntarily self-disclosing potential misconduct and by agreeing to disgorge \"the full amount of its ill-gotten gains\" to the SEC.", "Nevertheless, the DOJ made clear that the formal declination for Quad \"does not provide any protection against prosecution of any individuals\" associated with Quad, leaving open the possibility that the DOJ may bring individual charges against Quad executives.", "The conduct giving rise to Quad's dispositions with the DOJ and SEC occurred between 2010 and 2016. Prior to 2010, Quad was a private company primarily focused on sales in the United States.", "In 2010, Quad acquired World Color Press, Inc. (World Color), another printing company headquartered in Montreal, Canada, but with shares registered on the NYSE.", "After the acquisition, such shares in World Color became shares in Quad, making the company an \"issuer\" under the FCPA.", "Quad also acquired several former World Color subsidiaries outside the United States, most notably Quad/Graphics Peru S.A. (Quad Peru) and Quad/Tech Shanghai Trading Company, Ltd. (Quad/Tech China).", "According to the public documents, this acquisition substantially changed Quad's FCPA risk profile. Quad's new status as an issuer under the FCPA meant that it was now subject to the books-and-records and internal-accounting-controls provisions of the FCPA.", "Furthermore, Quad's new foreign subsidiaries in Peru and China increased the risk that company personnel might come into contact with foreign officials, potentially increasing the risk of improper payments.", "Despite this change in risk profile, Quad reportedly failed to put in place measures to appropriately mitigate FCPA risk.", "According to the SEC Order, the company's compliance program immediately after acquisition was \"non-existent\" and the company's \"internal audit had no visible role in anti-corruption testing and the company failed to conduct broad FCPA or ethics training until approximately 2012.\"", "Against this backdrop, the SEC found that Quad failed to meet its FCPA books-and-records and internal-accounting-controls obligations in a number of areas, namely:", "- Failure to prevent payments to MINEDU and INEI officials in Peru: According to the SEC Order, from 2011 to 2015, Quad Peru's insufficient bookkeeping and internal accounting controls allowed senior executives at Quad Peru to make improper payments to government officials at the Peruvian Ministry of Education (MINEDU), the Peruvian National Institute of Statistics Information (INEI), and various Peruvian municipalities.", "Quad Peru executives allegedly made payments to sham vendors for various services that were in fact handled by Quad Peru employees in house or by unrelated external third parties.", "The Order states that the sham vendors, three of which were owned by an individual with influence in the Peruvian government, then allegedly passed these payments onto officials at MINEDU, INEI, and various Peruvian municipalities in order to obtain various benefits for the company, including assistance in securing contracts and leniency in meeting delivery dates and avoiding penalties under existing contracts.", "In 2013, finance personnel within Quad Peru had notified a finance executive for Latin America who was based in the U.S. about certain suspicious invoices issued by the sham vendors, raising concerns about red flags such as identical dates and dollar amounts for certain invoices, as well as consecutive invoice numbers.", "However, it was only after the departure of a senior Quad Peru finance manager in 2015 that the invoices were reported up to the chain to Quad's U.S. legal department.", "- Failure to prevent judicial bribery in Peru: From 2011 to 2013, Quad Peru's management allegedly arranged for payments to Peruvian judges through a local law firm initially retained to handle ongoing litigation with the Peruvian tax authority, Superintendencia Nacional de Aduanas y de Administraciόn Tributaria (SUNAT).", "Specifically, after litigation settlements, the local law firm allegedly suggested that Quad Peru make payments to certain Peruvian judges to influence their decisions in the SUNAT court case, which would be facilitated by the law firm itself.", "According to the Order, with approval from at least one operations executive based in the United States, Quad Peru executives agreed to the law firm's proposed plan and funneled payments to litigation and administrative court judges, either through invoices issued directly by the law firm to Quad Peru for \"success fees\" or \"extraordinary fees\" or through invoices issued to Quad Peru by other third-party vendors, which were then paid and the funds returned to a Quad Peru executive to pay the law firm.", "The SEC noted that specific payments through the law firm coincided with favorable judicial decisions in the litigation.", "The law firm also allegedly refunded some payments after a setback in the litigation at the appellate level.", "- Concealment of prohibited business with Cuban state-owned entity in Peru: From 2010 to 2013, Quad Peru also continued certain pre-acquisition contracts for the printing telephone directories with the Cuban state-controlled telecommunication company, Empresa de Telecomunicaciones de Cuba S.A. (ETECSA).", "Possibly due to concerns about compliance with sanctions against Cuba by the United States, Quad Peru executives sought to conceal the nature of these contracts from the company's U.S. legal department after acquisition.", "Per the Order, such concealment efforts included removing any references to Cuba and the Cuban company's full name in company reports, as well as hiring a \"broker\" or \"pass through\" in Peru whose name would appear on contracts, shipping documents, invoices, and journal entries when the true customer was in fact ETESCA in Cuba.", "The Order alleges that executives in both Peru and the United States also actively misled the U.S. legal department, writing in e-mails that sales with Cuba had been discontinued.", "Quad Peru executives also allegedly paid hotel bills for ETESCA officials who visited Peru to review sample telephone directives and paid for sales representatives to travel to Cuba to meet with officials about pending printing projects.", "- Failure to prevent kickbacks in China: Finally, the SEC Order alleges that Quad/Tech China employees engaged in a scheme to bribe customers and win business in China from 2010 to 2015.", "Specifically, Quad/Tech China allegedly paid fake commissions of approximately two percent of sales orders to sales agents.", "According to the SEC, these sales agents did not provide any legitimate services, but instead transferred the two percent to employees of Quad/Tech China's customers, including Chinese state-owned entities and privately-owned companies.", "These payments were allegedly described in invoices as \"technical service fees\" and in Quad/Tech China's books and records as \"commissions.\"", "- Use of the FCPA Books-and-Records and Internal-Accounting-Controls Provisions to Investigate Potential U.S. Sanctions Violations: As noted above, a portion of the alleged misconduct by Quad involved concealing ongoing business with a Cuban entity in company reports, contracts, shipping documents, invoices, and journal entries.", "While rare, this is not the first time that the FCPA's books-and-records and the internal-accounting-control provisions have been cited in a settlement in relation to conduct that may have violated U.S. sanctions law.", "Most recently, in 2013, the SEC reached a settlement with the Swiss oilfield equipment and services provider Weatherford International Ltd. that included sanctions-related issues.", "While the SEC has been criticized for using settlements to expand the scope of the accounting provisions beyond their statutory definition, much of the misconduct cited here in relation to potential sanctions issues – falsifying company reports, invoices, and accounting journal entries – falls within the generally understood ambit of the books-and-records provisions.", "- Improper Payments Arranged Through Local Law Firm: Quad Peru's local law firm played a central role in the judicial bribery scheme, allegedly first suggesting that the company make payments to certain judges after litigation setbacks and offering to arrange for the payment on top of the legitimate legal service also provided.", "This highlights the potential corruption risks posed by local counsel, which, like other higher-risk third parties, often interact directly with government officials (judges and regulators) on companies' behalf.", "Indeed, payments funneled through local counsel have been the basis for charges in past enforcement actions, including Layne Christensen Company and Stryker Corporation.", "Managing these risks can also be challenging, as law firm services can also be more difficult to benchmark than services rendered by other agents.", "Generally, however, this FCPA risk can be mitigated if companies subject local law firms to the same controls as other third-party service providers, including due diligence, benchmarking, and auditing, among other measures.", "- Alleged Lack of Sufficient Compliance Measures Following Acquisition: Although the FCPA books-and-records and internal-accounting-controls provisions cover only certain accounting and controls obligations, the SEC tends to consider such technical provisions alongside broader compliance failures, including failure to conduct training, failure to adopt sufficient policies and procedures, and failure to include anti-corruption during internal audits.", "The SEC appeared to follow the same playbook here, noting the company's \"non-existent\" compliance program at the time of acquisition and initial failure to make use of internal audit's capabilities and FCPA or ethics training.", "Barclays Plc Resolves Hiring Practices-Related FCPA Allegations with SEC for $6.31 Million", "On September 27, 2019, the SEC issued a Cease-and-Desist Order (Order) to resolve allegations that Barclays PLC (Barclays) violated the books-and-records and internal-accounting-controls provisions of the FCPA.", "During the period in question, Barclays, a bank holding company headquartered in London, United Kingdom, registered American Depository Receipts on the New York Stock Exchange and filed periodic reports with SEC and, therefore, was an \"issuer\" for the purposes of the FCPA.", "As described more fully below, according to the Order, from at least 2009 through August 2013, offices in Barclays' Asia Pacific (APAC) region provided employment opportunities to approximately 117 relatives and friends of government officials and private sector clients, with most provided through an \"unofficial internship program.\"", "The Order further alleges \"Barclays failed to devise and maintain a system of internal accounting controls\" to provide reasonable assurances that its \"employees were not using employment opportunities as an improper inducement.\"", "The Order required Barclays to pay $3,824,686 in disgorgement, $984,040 in prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty of $1,500,000.", "The Order indicated that the SEC considered that Barclay self-reported prior to the SEC launching an investigation, undertook remedial steps including the termination of senior personnel, revisions to hiring policies, and enhancements to other elements of its compliance program, in addition to making factual information and personnel available to the SEC.", "In the Order, the SEC alleged that although Barclays' policies prohibited leveraging employment opportunities for future business, Barclays did not train APAC employees or monitor adherence to the policies.", "The Order details instances, for example, where Barclays executives indicated that they \"did not know that offers of internships or employment were items of value or that such offers could not be used to obtain business.\"", "The Order also details how certain executives, even compliance personnel, were unaware of Barclays' anti-bribery policies or the FCPA.", "For example, the Order notes that \"a senior regional compliance executive said that he had never read the 2009 anti-bribery and corruption policy, which required pre-approval by compliance before Barclays could offer internships to public officials or their close family members.\"", "This same individual also said, according to the Order, \"that it was not until 2012 that the he understood that an internship was considered an item of value for compliance purposes.\"", "Compliance personnel also indicated a lack of awareness of how to monitor policy compliance.", "The Order indicated that in April 2009, an \"unofficial intern program\" for Barclays Korea was approved by a senior executive in APAC.", "The unofficial program was not part of the bank's formal internship program. Ostensibly, the unofficial program's purpose was to provide professional experiences for students and occasionally to offer employment opportunities to individuals who had a relationship with Barclays and were qualified for the opportunity.", "Rather than being an occasional practice, the Order noted that \"[a]pproximately half of the candidates between 2009 – 2013\" were connected to a client of the bank.", "A Barclays senior executive responsible for the program said that he believed \"the key factor\" in hiring a candidate was the business the associated client could provide to Barclays.", "The Order provided numerous examples of internship offers to the children of government decision-makers.", "For example, in April 2009, a Korea-based banker suggested that Barclays extend an internship offer to the child of an influential figure at a state-owned entity (SOE) while Barclays vied to manage the SOE's bond offering.", "Barclays extended the internship offer and, shortly thereafter, was named the bond offering's lead manager, which generated approximately $971,000 in fees for the bank.", "A month later, in May 2009, after an executive at a Korean SOE requested that Barclays hire a specific individual for a permanent position notwithstanding that candidate performed worse than another candidate, a Barclays banker endorsed the hiring indicating it was important to honor the request \"to avoid potentially losing that client's business,\" according to the Order.", "Without compliance's preapproval, which was required under Barclay's policy, a senior executive approved the hire.", "Just one month later, in June 2009, at the request of the same SOE, Barclays hired the specific individual for an internship.", "Later that month Barclays received bond offering work from the SOE, earning approximately $1.15 million in revenue.", "The Order indicated that by June 2009, APAC compliance officers knew of the practices described above but failed to fully perform their responsibilities consistent with the anti-bribery policy.", "For example, the Order notes that if \"compliance officers reviewed relationship hiring requests, their review was generally limited to potential conflicts of interest, despite an April 2009 Barclays policy that expressly addressed anti-corruption risks\" for such hires.", "The Order provides that compliance officers were unaware of the policy's anti-bribery aspects, with one senior compliance officer stating that he had not read the policy, while a senior compliance officer who was responsible for the review of relationship hires represented that \"he never reviewed information relating to pending business with Barclays' clients even though he had access to that information.\"", "Notwithstanding the requirement for compliance review and approval, referral hires were made without involving compliance, involving compliance but withholding or falsifying information to hide the person who referred the candidate, or failing to implement safeguards required by compliance.", "For example, in September 2010 bankers requested to hire the daughter of an influential official of a Chinese SOE.", "The candidate did not perform well in the interview process, but still the banker advocated for her hire due to the \"tangible business\" she would bring.", "The Order provided that when a compliance officer raised the issue to a more senior compliance officer, the latter responded, \"I am sure this is not the first time,\" and approved the hire provided the business attested that she would be hired \"for her qualifications and her skills, not for any other reason.\"", "No such attestation was provided and, nevertheless, Barclays offered the individual a spot in their graduate program, according to the Order.", "Barclays adopted a \"work experience program\" in APAC in May 2011, to better address relationship hires, according to the Order.", "As part of the program's controls, Barclays personnel had to disclose whether a client had referred the candidate and to document the reasons for hiring the individual.", "Notwithstanding the enhanced controls, violations of the new program occurred. For example, a SOE executive asked the bank to hire the daughter of a close friend whose employer regulated the SOE.", "Barclays hired the individual even though the compliance department was aware the bank was vying for a role in the SOE's bond issuance.", "The SOE hired Barclays for the issuance, resulting in approximately $300,000 in fees for Barclays.", "In March 2012, Barclays sought to improve its referral hiring controls by requiring employees to attest that candidates were not recruited to obtain or retain business.", "The Order notes the improved process had \"little impact,\" as bankers make incorrect representations or provided accurate attestations which compliance approved knowing of business opportunities.", "For example, in May 2012, at the request of a SOE official, compliance approved an intern's hiring when the business rational indicated \"client relationship.\"", "In July 2012, Barclays again sought to improve its guidance by reiterating \"zero tolerance\" of bribery, which included employment offers.", "As with other improvements, the July 2012 enhancement had little impact in APAC. For example, in November 2012, the treasurer of a SOE sought out Barclays to secure an internship in the formal summer program for a child of a party official and director at the SOE.", "In support of the individual's candidacy, a banker forwarded the government official's request to Barclays executives and managers \"explaining that the candidate's father held an ‘important' post\" and that Barclays was trying to win bond work with the SOE.", "A senior banker responded to the group, writing \"[w]e will evaluate [the candidate] on his own merits\" and then, minutes later, separately wrote the banker \"I had to say that.\"", "The Order indicated that notwithstanding the candidate's subpar interviews, poor technical capabilities, a late application, and no evidence of compliance's review, Barclays offered the candidate a position.", "In July 2013, the SOE selected Barclays for a bond deal, for which Barclays earned approximately $332,700 in revenue.", "In March 2013, Barclay's Financial Crime Compliance unit recommended that the work experience program be shut down.", "At the same time, news reports highlighted similar hiring practices at other financial institutions in Asia.", "In response, instead of terminating the program, Barclays again revised the program's controls. The Order indicated that Barclays improved policy, governance, and training initiatives; introduced regional help desks to facilitate the escalation of issues; and adopted independent testing and assurance initiatives to improve the efficacy of the controls, among other enhancements.", "The Order alleged employees \"submitted, reviewed, and approved inaccurate compliance questionnaires and attestations forms containing inaccurate information that failed to disclose the true source of candidates referred for hire and the intended purpose for the relationship hires.\"", "As a result, Barclays violated the books-and-records provision of the FCPA.", "With respect to the internal-accounting-controls provisions, the Order alleges that even though Barclays had instituted polices, the bank failed to implement them adequately.", "- Hiring Practices Industry Sweep: Barclays is the sixth FCPA enforcement action based in whole or in part on hiring practices.", "In August 2015, BNY Mellon settled, followed by Qualcomm (March 2016), JP Morgan (November 2016), Credit Suisse (July 2018), and Deutsche Bank (August 2019).", "Five of the entities – all but Qualcomm – are financial service providers, suggesting an industry sweep.", "Industry sweeps are particularly attractive to enforcement authorities as similar practices are often seen across different companies in the same industry, thereby enabling regulators to leverage their learnings from one investigation across several potentially similar investigations.", "- Disgorgement But No Bribery Charge: The SEC did not allege violations of the FCPA's anti-bribery provisions yet required disgorgement of Barclays' ill-gotten gains.", "Notwithstanding the absence of the anti-bribery charge, the SEC sought disgorgement. Initially, this approach may be viewed as at odds with the purpose of disgorgement – an equitable remedy to put the culpable party in the position they would have been but for the improper conduct – and another tool to punish wrongdoing, more akin to a fine.", "On the other hand, the Order does describe conduct by employees in Barclays' APAC offices that the SEC likely viewed as improper payments, even if the conduct may have been outside the reach of the FCPA.", "It is worth noting that foreign-based issuers (such as Barclays) are not subject to the \"alternative jurisdiction\" provision of the FCPA, and therefore the SEC would need to meet heightened jurisdiction standards in assessing whether the relevant conduct violated the anti-bribery provisions of the FCPA.", "- Conduct Beyond the Statute of Limitations Led to Disgorgement: Another aspect of the disgorgement that is noteworthy is that all of the disgorgement is for conduct that occurred between 2009 and 2013 – between six and 10 years ago – and seemingly outside of the statute's statute of limitations and at odds with the Supreme Court's decision in Kokesh.", "As a practical matter, it likely that Barclays agreed with the SEC to toll the statute during the investigation and settlement discussions, rendering the limitation period and Kokesh decision as nonfactors.", "Westport Fuels Systems Enters into $4 Million FCPA Settlement with SEC", "On September 27, 2019, the SEC entered into a Cease-and-Desist Order (Order) with Westport Fuels Systems, Inc. (Westport), a Canadian fuel technology company, that included just over $4 million in fines and disgorgement.", "Westport has common stock registered under Section 12(b) of the Exchange Act and available on the NASDAQ, bringing it under the jurisdiction of the SEC.", "In a parallel proceeding, the SEC also reached a settlement with the former Chief Executive Officer of Westport, Nancy Gougarty, a U.S. citizen residing in South Carolina, that called for her to pay a civil penalty of $120,000.", "Gougarty was the CEO of Westport from July 2016 through January 2019, and also served as a member of the Board of Directors during that time, and originally joined the company in July 2013 as Chief Operating Officer.", "According to the Order, Westport violated the books-and-records provision and the internal-accounting-controls provisions of the FCPA, via the acts of Gougarty during her time at the company.", "Neither Westport nor Gougarty admitted or denied the findings in the Order.", "Per the Order, Westport, through the actions of Gougarty and other employees, bribed a Chinese government official in exchange for the official exerting influence to allow \"an increased dividend payment of $3.5 million to Westport\" and to secure a \"framework supply agreement\" between Westport and a joint venture controlled by a Chinese state-owned enterprise (but also owned in part by Westport).", "The relevant official held a senior-level position with the Chinese state-owned-entity that held a controlling stake in the relevant joint venture.", "The Order stated that the primary vehicle for the bribe was an agreement by Westport, directed and facilitated by Gougarty, to transfer a certain portion of shares in the joint venture \"at a low valuation\" to \"a Chinese private equity fund in which Gougarty and others had been informed that the Government Official held a financial interest.\"", "The Order stated that the bribery scheme was initiated due to efforts to take the joint venture between Westport and the Chinese state-owned entity public through an initial public offering (which ultimately never occurred).", "Various proposals for re-structuring the venture were made, and the Order notes that Gougarty and the Asia Pacific General Manager (GM) for Westport headed the negotiations related to those transactions.", "According to the SEC, \"[e]arly in the negotiations, the Asia Pacific GM reported that he was told that the Government Official had a significant but undisclosed financial interest in the Chinese private equity fund that was to receive the JV shares from Westport.\"", "The Asia Pacific GM \"also reported that it was the Government Official's personal financial interest, not Chinese law, which was motivating the transfer of shares to the private equity fund.\"", "The Order describes how the \"Government Official's personal interest became a central part of Westport's negotiation strategy\" – driving Westport's demands for the dividend payment and the \"framework supply agreement\" for Westport in exchange for facilitating the share transfer.", "The Order also notes that Westport's negotiations were affected by the company's \"worsening finances\" and market issues.", "The SEC alleged that Gougarty did not inform the Westport Board of Directors regarding her knowledge of the government official's personal financial interest when the Board considered approval of proposed transactions.", "The SEC specifically noted that \"[i]n fact, approximately nine months before obtaining the Board's approval, Gougarty withheld this information from the Board, deleting a sentence in a September 2014 draft letter to the Board prepared by the Asia Pacific GM that described the proposed transfer.\"", "The Westport Board of Directors voted to approve the share transfer on June 29, 2015. By October 2016, Westport had received a dividend and had secured the supply agreement with the joint venture, as agreed to in the bribery scheme as described in the Order.", "According to the SEC, Gougarty had reviewed the 2010 and 2016 versions of the Westport Code of Conduct and was aware of the Code's prohibitions against bribery; she also had been trained on the FCPA at another company.", "Nevertheless, she proceeded with the conduct described in the Order. The SEC also stated that \"[a]s evidenced by her own misconduct, Gougarty as CEO failed to discharge her duty on behalf of Westport to devise and maintain a sufficient system of internal accounting controls.\"", "The SEC Order contained some criticisms of Westport's compliance program and related internal accounting controls at the time of the described conduct.", "The Order acknowledged that the relevant Codes of Conduct banned the payment of bribes to government officials via third parties and required due diligence as part of the process to engage a third party to provide services to the Company.", "However, the SEC noted that the Code did not specifically mandate due diligence of any transactions where a government official may have an interest in the third party.", "The Code also failed to mandate the use of anti-bribery clauses in agreements with third parties when conducting a share transfer, as in the case with the joint venture.", "Further, the SEC asserted that Gougarty executed a certification \"falsely attesting that Westport had disclosed all significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design and operation of its internal controls to the outside auditors.\"", "The Order stated in this regard that \"as Gougarty knew, she had failed to disclose to the outside auditors the deficiencies and weaknesses in the internal controls that she had exploited in carrying out an unlawful bribery scheme in circumvention of Westport's anti-bribery policies and its key accounting controls.\"", "The SEC noted certain remediation efforts undertaken by Westport as well. The Order recognized that Westport had improved its \"anticorruption and compliances policies and training programs, and its disclosure policies and controls\" as well as specific internal accounting controls that would have addressed due diligence of transactions and third parties as described in the Order.", "Additionally, Westport voluntarily provided documents requested by the agency and made witnesses available.", "Despite these efforts, the Order required Westport to pay $2.35M in disgorgement, $196,000 in prejudgment interest and $1.5M in civil penalties.", "In addition, the SEC required Westport to undertake certain self-monitoring and self-reporting obligations related to the company's compliance program and related controls – consisting of an initial report to the SEC followed by two additional reviews and reports over the next two years.", "The Order requires the reports to focus in part on \"implementation of compliance measures, particularly as to the areas of due diligence of third-party entities and persons, FCPA training and the testing of relevant controls including the collection and analysis of compliance data.\"", "- Investment Valuation Used as a Bribe: The SEC alleged that the use of an investment valuation, in this case purposefully lowering the valuation of the JV in order to transfer the shares to a fund affiliated with the government official, constituted a bribe.", "While the use of an investment valuation as a bribe is unusual, this stance by the agency is not unprecedented – and is long-standing.", "In the 1986 Ashland Oil case, the SEC cited as improper a transaction in which Ashland purchased a chrome mine in Zimbabwe from an official for approximately $25 million dollars, when more objective asset assessments and contemporaneous transactions involving a portion of the assets showed the value to be far less.", "More recently, enforcement actions by the DOJ and SEC in September 2017 against Telia Company AB (Telia) involved the company's transactions with a shell company of a government official in order to indirectly pay money to the foreign official.", "According to the SEC's Cease-and-Desist Order, Telia's bribes were funneled through payments for \"sham lobbying and consulting services to a front company controlled by the foreign official.\"", "We covered Telia's settlements in our FCPA Autumn Review 2017. As such, the Westport settlement emphasizes the importance of companies implementing effective controls to review transactions as well as valuations in order to ensure they are not used as a mechanism to conceal bribes and related misconduct.", "- Executive Involvement: It is of note that the agency decided to proceed with both disgorgement and a civil monetary penalty against Westport and penalties against Gougarty individually.", "The involvement of the former CEO of Westport directly in coordinating and setting up the bribery scheme likely played a part in the agency's decision to seek both remedies in this instance.", "As described in the Order, Gougarty was actively involved in hiding information from other Board members to carry out the bribery scheme, including purposefully deleting information from a letter to the Board that would have disclosed the role of the private equity fund in the scheme, and not carrying out proper due diligence on the fund.", "It would behoove other companies to ensure that multi-player controls are in place and review mechanisms in order to avoid misconduct by senior management.", "According to Westport's securities filing, the company disclosed the SEC investigation and settlement and did not mention an investigation by the DOJ into Gougarty and the company.", "Second Circuit Declines to Extend McDonnell in Two Bribery Appeals", "In August, the Second Circuit Court of Appeals – in two separate decisions – upheld the convictions of Macau, China-based billionaire real estate developer Ng Lap Seng and former Guinean mining minister Mahmoud Thiam, both of whom argued that the standard for proving bribery articulated by the Supreme Court in McDonnell v. United States should have been applied to their cases.", "As reported in our FCPA Autumn Review 2017, a federal jury found Ng Lap Seng guilty of paying approximately $1.3 million in bribes to two former United Nations officials in exchange for formal U.N. support for a multi-billion dollar conference center he planned to construct in Macau.", "Ng was convicted of paying illegal bribes and gratuities, violating the FCPA, money laundering, and conspiracy to commit those offenses.", "He was sentenced to four years in prison and fined $1 million.", "In appealing his conviction and sentence, Ng argued that McDonnell, which narrowly interpreted the term \"official act\" as used in the U.S. domestic bribery statute (18 U.S.C. § 201(a)(3)), should also apply to offenses charged under the FCPA and the federal program bribery statute, 18 U.S.C. § 666.", "Specifically, Ng argued that the DOJ failed to prove that the bribes he paid resulted in any \"official acts\" by the former U.N. officials, and that the jury was not properly instructed that an \"official act\" was required to fulfill the \"quid pro quo\" elements of the FCPA and § 666.", "Moreover, because he was arrested before the conference center could be built, Ng argued that no \"official act\" could have occurred.", "The Second Circuit disagreed and declined to extend McDonnell to either bribery statute. In holding that neither the FCPA nor § 666 require prosecutors to show that bribes have been paid in exchange for an \"official act,\" the Second Circuit interpreted the \"quid pro quos\" of each statute broadly.", "Section 666 broadly prohibits bribery concerning programs receiving federal funding and does not mention \"official acts\" or place any limits on the type of businesses or transactions that can be influenced beyond a connection with a threshold amount of federal funding.", "Similarly, the court found that the FCPA broadly prohibits giving anything of value in exchange for four specific actions: (1) influencing an act or decision of a foreign official; (2) inducing a foreign official to do or omit any act; (3) securing any improper advantage; or (4) inducing the foreign official to influence an act of a foreign government.", "None of those actions, the court noted, are limited to the definition of \"official act\" as that term is used in 18 U.S.C. § 201 and defined by McDonnell.", "The Second Circuit's decision joins the Third, Fifth, Sixth, and Eighth Circuits in declining to extend McDonnell to other anticorruption and fraud statutes.", "In addition, the Second Circuit is the first court to consider the application of McDonnell to the FCPA, and as a result may influence future charging decisions as prosecutors choose to pursue corrupt conduct under the FCPA and other anticorruption statutes where McDonnell's narrow \"official act\" standard is not applicable.", "Ng has filed a petition for a rehearing of his appeal.", "The Second Circuit rejected a similar appear from Mahmoud Thiam, the former Guinean minister of mining and geology who was convicted in 2017 of laundering $8.5 million in bribes from two Chinese investment firms, which violated both U.S. money laundering statues and Guinea's bribery law.", "Thiam accepted the payments in exchange for assistance securing lucrative mineral contracts in Guinea—payments which he then deposited in several U.S. banks.", "Thiam appealed his conviction and seven-year sentence on grounds that prosecutors failed to prove he committed an \"official act\" under the standard articulated by McDonnell because he did not have any influence over decisions to award the contracts.", "Because violations of Guinean antibribery law were the predicate offenses underlying Thiam's money laundering conviction, he argued that McDonnell's definition of \"official act\" should apply.", "The Second Circuit disagreed and declined to apply McDonnell to a foreign bribery statute. The court noted that to apply McDonnell's definition of \"official act\" to the Guinean statute would necessarily require the court to interpret Guinean law and potentially limit the type of conduct that Guinea had chosen to criminalize.", "Moreover, the court noted that no existing Second Circuit precedent supported the application of McDonnell beyond honest services fraud and Hobbs Act extortion cases and thus \"principles of international comity\" precluded such an extension in this case.", "On June 26, 2019, Julia Vivi Wang, a naturalized U.S. citizen born in China, was sentenced to three years of supervised release and restitution in the sum of $629,295 after she pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy to violate the FCPA, one count of violating the FCPA, and one count of submitting fraudulent tax returns.", "As reported in our FCPA Summer Review 2018, Ms. Wang wired $500,000 to John W.

Reference [124] suggested tackling the instabilities by damping the oscillations caused by charging and discharging of EV batteries using a wide area control method.", "The situation can also be handled by changing the tap settings of transformers [125], by a properly planned charging system, and also by using control systems like fuzzy logic controllers to calculate voltages and SOCs of batteries [81].", "- Harmonics: The EV charger characteristics, being nonlinear, gives raise high frequency components of current and voltage, known as harmonics.", "The amount of harmonics in a system can be expressed by the parameters total current harmonic distortion (THDi) and total voltage harmonic distortion (THDv):", "- Voltage sag: A decrease in the RMS value of voltage for half a cycle or 1 min is denoted as voltage sag.", "It can be caused by overload or during the starting of electric machines.

The extra heat generated by EV loads can lead to increased aging rate of the transformers, but it also depends on the ambient temperature.", "In places with generally cold weather like Vermont, the aging due to temperature is negligible [81]. Estimation of the lifetime of a transformer is done in [143], where factors taken into account are the rate of EV penetration, starting time of charging and the ambient temperature.", "It stated that transformers can withstand 10% EV penetration without getting any decrease in lifetime.", "The effect of level 1 charging, is in fact, has negligible effect on this lifetime, but significant increase in level 2 charging can lead to the failure of transformers [144].", "Elnozahy et al., stated that overloading of transformer can happen with 20% PHEV penetration for level 1 charging, whereas level 2 does it with 10% penetration", "[145]. According to [122], charging that takes place right after an EV being plugged in can be detrimental to the transformers.", "- Power quality degradation: The increased amount of harmonics and imbalance in voltage will degrade the power quality in case of massive scale EV penetration to the grid.", "- Smart grid: In the smart grid system, intelligent communication and decision making is incorporated with the grid architecture.", "Smart grid is highly regarded as the future of power grids and offers a vast array of advantages to offer reliable power supply and advanced control.", "In such a system, the much coveted coordinated charging is easily achievable as interaction with the grid system becomes very much convenient even from the user end.", "The interaction of EVs and smart grid can facilitate opportunities like V2G and better integration of renewable energy.", "In fact, EV is one the eight priorities listed to create an efficient smart grid [117].", "- V2G: V2G or vehicle to grid is a method where the EV can provide power to the grid. In this system, the vehicles act as loads when they are drawing energy, and then can become dynamic energy storages by feeding back the energy to the grid.", "In coordinated charging, the EV loads are applied in the valley points of the load curve, in V2G; EVs can act as power sources to provide during peak hours.", "V2G is realizable with the smart grid system. By making use of the functionalities of smart grid, EVs can be used as dynamic loads or dynamic storage systems.", "The power flow in this system can be unidirectional or bidirectional. The unidirectional system is analogous to the coordinated charging scheme, the vehicles are charged when the load is low, but the time to charge the vehicles is decided automatically by the system.", "Vehicles using this scheme can simply be plugged in anytime and put there; the system will choose a suitable time and charge it.", "Smart meters are required for enabling this system. With a driver variable charging scheme, the peak power demand can be reduced by 56% [117].", "Sortomme et al., found this system particularly attractive as it required little up gradation of the existing infrastructure; creating a communication system in-between the grid and the EVs is all that is needed [146].", "The bidirectional system allows vehicles to provide power back to the grid. In this scenario, vehicles using this scheme will supply energy to the grid from their storage when it is required.", "This method has several appealing aspects. With ever increasing integration of renewable energy sources (RES) to the grid, energy storages are becoming essential to overcome their intermittency, but the storages have a very high price.", "EVs have energy storages, and in many cases, they are not used for a long time. Example for this point can be the cars in the parking lots of an office block, where they stay unused till the office hour is over, or vehicles that are used in a specific time of the year, like a beach buggy.", "Studies also revealed that, vehicles stay parked 95% of the time [117]. These potential storages can be used when there is excess generation or low demand and when the energy is needed, it is taken back to the grid.", "The vehicle owners can also get economically beneficial by selling this energy to the grid. In [147], Clement-Nyns et al., concluded that a combination of PHEVs can prove beneficial to distributed generation sources by providing storage for the excess generation, and releasing that to the grid later.", "Bidirectional charging, however, needs chargers capable of providing power flow in both directions. It also needs smart meters to keep track of the units consumed and sold, and advanced metering architecture (AMI) to learn about the unit charges in real time to get actual cost associated with the charging or discharging at the exact time of the day.", "The AMI system can shift 54% of the demand to off-peak periods, and can reduce peak consumption by 36%", "[117]. The bidirectional system, in fact, can provide 12.3% more annual revenue than the unidirectional one.", "But taking the metering and protections systems required in the bidirectional method, this revenue is nullified and indicates the unidirectional system is more practical.", "Frequent charging and discharging caused by bidirectional charging can also reduce battery life and increase energy losses from the conversion processes [81,117].", "In a V2G scenario, operators with a vehicle fleet are likely to reduce their cost of operation by 26.5% [117].", "Another concept is produced using the smart grid and the EVs, called virtual power plant (VPP), where a cluster of vehicles is considered as a power plant and dealt like one in the system.", "VPP architecture and control is shown in Figure 62. Table 26 shows the characteristics of unidirectional and bidirectional V2G.", "- Integration of renewable energy sources: Renewable energy usage becomes more promising with EVs integrated into the picture.", "EV owners can use RES to generate power locally to charge their EVs. Parking lot roofs have high potential for the placement of PV panels which can charge the vehicles parked underneath as well as supplying the grid in case of excess generation [148,149,150], thus serving the increase of commercial RES deployment.", "The V2G structure is further helpful to integrate RES for charging of EVs, and to the grid as well, as it enables the selling of energy to the grid when there is surplus, for example, when vehicles are parked and the system knows the user will not need the vehicle before a certain time.", "V2G can also enable increased penetration of wind energy (41%–59%) in the grid in an isolated system [121].", "References [151,152,153,154] worked with different architectures to observe the integration scenario of wind energy with EV assistance.", "Figure 63 demonstrates integration of wind and solar farm with conventional coal and nuclear power grid with EV charging station employing bidirectional V2G. Table 27 shows the types of assistance EVs can provide for integrating renewable energy sources to the grid.", "- EVs can be classified as BEV, HEV, PHEV, and FCEV. BEVs and PHEVs are the current trends. FCEVs can become mainstream in future.", "Low cost fuel cells are the main prerequisite for that and there is need of more research to make that happen.", "There are also strong chances for BEVs to be the market dominators with ample advancement in key technologies; energy storage and charging systems being two main factors.", "Currently FCVs appear to have little chance to become ubiquitous, these may find popularity in niche markets, for example, the military and utility vehicles.", "- EVs can be front wheel drive, rear wheel drive, even all-wheel drive. Different configurations are applied depending on the application of the vehicle.", "The motor can also be placed inside the wheel of the vehicle which offers distinct advantages. This configuration is not commercially abundant now, and has scopes for more study to turn it into a viable product.", "- The main HEV configurations are classified as series, parallel, and series-parallel. Current vehicles are using the series-parallel system mainly as it can operate in both battery-only and ICE-only modes, providing more efficiency and less fuel consumption than the other two systems.", "- Currently EVs use batteries as the main energy source. Battery technology has gone through significant changes, the lead-acid technology is long gone, as is the NiMH type.", "Li-ion batteries are currently in use, but even they are not capable enough to provide the amount of energy required to appease the consumers suffering from ‘range anxiety’ in most cases.", "Therefore the main focus of research in this area has to be creating batteries with more capacity, and also with better power densities.", "Metal-air batteries can be the direction where the EV makers will head towards. Lithium-sulfur battery and advanced rechargeable zinc batteries also have potential provide better EVs.", "Nevertheless, low cost energy sources will be sought after always as ESS cost is one of the major contributors to high EV cost.", "- Ultracapacitors are considered as auxiliary power sources because of their high power densities. If coupled with batteries, ultracapacitors produce a hybrid ESS that can satisfy some requirements demanded from an ideal source.", "Flywheels are also being used, especially because of their compact build and capability to store and discharge power on demand.", "Fuel cells can also be used more in the future if FCVs gain popularity.", "- Different types of motors can be employed for EV use. The prominent ones can be listed as induction motor, permanent magnet synchronous motor, and synchronous reluctance motor.", "Induction motors are being extensively these days, they can also dominate in future because of their independence on rare-earth material permanent magnets.", "- EVs can be charged with AC or DC supply. There are different voltage levels and they are designated accordingly.", "Higher voltage levels provide faster charging. DC supplies negate the need of rectification from AC, which reduces delay and loss.", "However, with increased voltage level, the pressure on the grid increases and can give rise to harmonics as well as voltage imbalance in an unsupervised system.", "Therefore, there are ample chances of research in the field of mitigating the problems associated with high-voltage charging.", "- Two charger configurations are mainly available now: CCS and CHAdeMO. These two systems are not compatible with each other and each has a number of automakers supporting them.", "Tesla also brought their own ‘supercharger’ system, which provides a faster charging facility. It is not possible to determine now which one of these will prevail, or if both will co-exist, technical study is needed to find out the most useful one of these configurations or ways to make them compatible with each other.", "- Whatever the charging system is, the charging time is still very long. This is a major disadvantage that is thwarting the growth of the EV market.", "Extensive research is needed in this sector to provide better technologies that can provide much faster charging and can be compatible with the small time required to refill an ICE vehicle.", "Wireless charging is also something in need of research. With all the conveniences it promises, it is still not in a viable form to commercialize.", "- EV impacts the environment, power system, and economy alongside the transportation sector. It shows promises to reduce the GHG emissions as well as efficient and economical transport solutions.", "At the same time, it can cause serious problems in the power system including voltage instability, harmonics, and voltage sag, but these shortcomings may be short-lived if smart grid technologies are employed.", "There are prospects of research in the areas of V2G, smart metering, integration of RES, and system stability associated with EV penetration.", "- EVs employ different techniques to reduce energy loss and increase efficiency. Reducing the drag coefficient, weight reduction, regenerative braking, and intelligent energy management are some of these optimization techniques.", "Further research directions can be better aerodynamic body designs, new materials with less weight and desired strength, ways to generate and restore the lost energy.", "- Different control algorithms have been developed for driving assist, energy management, and charging.", "There is lots of room left for more research into charging and energy management algorithms.

Thanks for joining us on this call. My name is Mina, and as CIMSEC’s Director of External Relations, I have the honor of moderating today’s call on maritime security trends in the Asia-Pacific.", "For our CIMSEC listeners, I am pleased to say we have an exciting panel lined up, with four distinguished Asia-Pacific experts joining us to discuss security issues in the maritime domain from various different angles.", "Before we begin, I would like to introduce our panelists.", "We have joining us today, Captain Jim Fanell, a Government Fellow with the Geneva Centre for Security Policy.", "Jim retired from the U.S. Navy in January 2015, after spending 30 years as a naval intelligence officer specializing in Asia-Pacific security, with an emphasis on the Chinese Navy and its operations.", "We have Greg Poling, director of the Asia Maritime Transparency Initiative and a fellow with the Southeast Asia Program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.", "He oversees research on U.S. foreign policy in the Asia-Pacific, with a particular focus on the maritime domain and the countries of Southeast Asia.", "World leaders gathered at the ASEAN-U.S. Summit (Getty Images)", "We also have Elina Noor, director for foreign policy and security studies at the Institute of Strategic and International Studies Malaysia.", "Her policy interests include U.S.-Malaysia bilateral relations, cyber warfare and security, radicalization and terrorism, and major power relations.", "And Scott Cheney-Peters also joins us, founder and chairman of CIMSEC, and a reservist in the U.S. Navy.", "His interests focus on maritime security in the Asia-Pacific and naval applications of emerging technologies.", "The views expressed are those of Scott’s alone and not necessarily representative of the U.S. government or U.S. Navy.", "Without further ado, I would like to begin with Jim.", "Jim, can you talk us through the most significant changes to the Chinese Navy over the course of 2016 – from a doctrinal and/or capabilities perspective?", "the prospects for U.S.-China cooperation or conflict in 2017? Are incidents like the spat over the UUV that China picked up last month likely to increase?", "Jim Fanell: First of all, thanks Mina for coordinating this and inviting me to participate. I’m very happy to be working again with CIMSEC and the great work you all do.", "To answer your questions as concisely as possible, the biggest thing that happened in 2016, in my view, after spending the last couple days reviewing about 10,000 of my emails from the Red Star Rising, is the series of major changes President Xi instituted to the PLA – creating a separate PLA headquarters, elevating the status of the strategic rocket forces and the strategic support force, and reorganizing the seven military regions to five theater commands – all of which had an indirect impact on the navy, elevating their status.", "The navy’s status had been rising since before 2016, but that trend continued throughout the past year, which is also evident when one considers the sheer number of events the Chinese Navy held – not only exercises inside the first island chain, but also the great number of operations that occurred outside the first island chain and globally in the Indian Ocean, the Mediterranean, up to the Baltic, down to the South Pacific, and into South America.", "What we saw was the solidification and culmination of Admiral Wu Shengli’s final year as chief of naval operations for the Chinese Navy.", "I think you also saw President Xi recognize that the PLA is the principal tool for Chinese power and acquisition, to maintain China’s outward orientation, including as a part of the One Belt, One Road Initiative.", "You also saw China participate in RIMPAC 2016, which is a very big operation for them, and a solidification of what they did in 2014 and 2012 – establishing the pattern that they expect to continue in 2018.", "In terms of shipbuilding, it looks like they built about 4.5 times as many ships as the U.S. did in the past year, so their shipbuilding program continued pretty strong.", "They were globally deployed in many ways, including submarines in the Indian Ocean while they were operating and doing fleet reviews in India – a kind of hard power-soft power approach by the Chinese.", "In 2017, we can look for more of the same in terms of their presence. They’ve made it clear that they want to break outside the first island chain, and they demonstrated that very consistently in 2016 – culminating the year with their naval air forces flying outside the first island chain with bombers, fighters, and re-fuelers, circumnavigating Taiwan with their aircraft carrier.", "I think we can also expect to see the rollout of the new carrier, an indigenous one. This will be their second carrier, but the first one they produced themselves.", "I think we’ll also get more information about their ballistic missile submarines officially being on SLBM patrol, helping shore up that portion of the nuclear deterrent capability they’ve been talking about.", "With controversies, like with the UUV at the end of last year, it’s quite possible we’ll see more things of that nature.", "I think what you’ll see though, especially in the South China Sea dispute over the Spratly Islands and even over Scarborough, is that you’re going to see the Chinese incrementally continue to react to the United States’ presence.", "Before October 2015, you could describe it as a “zone defense.” But by my read, from October 2015, through all of 2016, and even into 2017, the Chinese have taken a man-to-", "man approach in dealing with the presence of the United States in the South China Sea. I think, now, every time we’ve done one of our four freedom of navigation operations or when we have dual carrier operations or single carrier operations, the Chinese have gone out of their way to make clear and publicize that they are shadowing and following our naval vessels as soon as they come into the South China Sea.", "We can expect to see that increase, and the pressure from their vessels to become sharper in tone. I don’t expect to see shouldering or ramming, but it all depends on how they interpret the new administration.", "They will use statements and anything else that comes out of the new administration as justification for such challenging behavior – and we have to be prepared for that.", "Mina: Thank you, Jim. Now, I’d like to turn to Greg. What are the most salient facts to know about China’s recent construction activities in the South China Sea?", "To make sense of their construction activities, what are the key indicators you are looking for in 2017 as signals or markers for Chinese intentions?", "Will the PCA ruling or a potential ASEAN code of conduct modify Chinese behavior?", "Greg Poling: Thanks, Mina. I think what we saw, certainly over the last year, is continued consolidation by China of the installations made in the Spratlys and the expansion of its capabilities in the Paracels, all the while, at least in the second half of the year, pretty successfully diverting international criticism, at least diplomatically so.", "If you only read the press on the South China Sea in 2016, it looked like two different years. In the first half of the year was high level bullying, especially of the Philippines but also everybody else, in an effort to prevent nations from publicly supporting the PCA ruling, along with this “will they-won’t they” debate about construction at Scarborough, which the U.S. seems to have successfully deterred in the short-term.", "But after the July ruling, all of a sudden, we heard a tonal change from the Chinese. The election of President Rodrigo Duterte in the Philippines opened that door, but Beijing gladly walked through it.", "They continued to lash out at the U.S., Australia, Japan, and Singapore for perceived support of the Philippines, but towards the rest of ASEAN and especially the Philippines, they took a more polite approach.", "That pretty successfully helped them avoid the widespread censure that would have at least brought some pressure to change Chinese actions.", "Since that didn’t happen, I think they’ll see that they have largely a green light to return to a more coercive stance in 2017.", "So while all of this change in tone, and all of this diplomatic effort was going on, we still saw the completion of 72 small hangars for combat aircraft at the three biggest islands in the Spratlys, the construction of larger hangars for maritime patrol, heavy lift, and refueling craft, continued upgrades to ports and docking facilities that allow the Chinese Navy, coast guard, and paramilitary forces to stay out in the southern regions of the South China Sea 24/7 in a way they haven’t been able to prior to the artificial island construction, and we continue to see the increase in their monitoring capabilities with radar facilities, signals and intelligence.", "Fiery Cross Reef looks like it’s being turned into a hub for all of this data collection apparatus.", "What I’m going to be looking for next – which seems almost inevitable – is the first deployment of combat aircraft to the Spratlys, and I think that’s really a matter of when, not if.", "The Chinese did not build all of this air infrastructure to not use it. I think we should", "expect to see the deployment of surface-to-air missiles pretty soon. The HQ-9 systems that made waves last year are still emplaced on Woody Island.", "Woody Island has in many ways been a lower scale model of what we see in Mischief, Subi and Fiery Cross Reef.", "So I think we’ll see those deployments soon. And they might very well be used early in the next U.S. administration, as a test of the Trump team’s willingness to confront the Chinese.", "If you are a Southeast Asian claimant, life is going to get a lot harder this year. So far we’ve seen a backing off of the most aggressive behavior by the Chinese.", "But it’s also the middle of storm season, so we don’t have hundreds of fishermen getting into it with the Chinese like we will in the spring.", "I think we are going to see the next escalation triggers sooner rather than later as the math works against us – the sheer number of Chinese vessels willing to try to close off the disputed area to the claimants is going to increase, whether we like it or not.", "And on the code of conduct – much has been made of this pledge by Foreign Minster Wang Yi on the sidelines of the ARF that China would agree to a framework code of conduct by mid-2017.", "But that is a pretty “squishy” commitment. First, I have no idea what a “framework” for a code of conduct means.", "I don’t think anybody does. Second, we’ve seen no willingness by China to agree to a binding code of conduct – and even if they did, they have no willingness to clarify their claims, so it’s hard to imagine where that even applies.", "Third, if China’s past behavior is the best indicator of future behavior, then this seems to be nothing more than a delaying tactic.", "It took a decade to get China to agree to the guidelines for implementation of the DOC, which have still not been implemented, and have really done nothing to stop the escalation.", "Even if we get a toothless precursor to the COC this year, I don’t think it really changes anything.", "Mina: Thank you, Greg. Elina, focusing more on the bilateral aspect of the U.S. relationship with Southeast Asian states, and how the U.S. is trying to promote the rule of law in this complicated dispute, how significant are the changes we saw in 2016 in terms of the U.S. relationship with Vietnam?", "And with the Philippines? How are other states – such as Malaysia, Singapore, Indonesia – trying to respond to the increasing U.S.-China tension in the region?", "Elina Noor: I think the short answer to your last question is, is with difficulty. But I think context is very important to keep in mind here.", "When considering Southeast Asian states and the sometimes puzzling behavior of their respective leaders, we often tend to superimpose a geopolitical, major power rivalry – in this case the U.S. and China – to understand some of their complex behavior, and we often fail to see things from the national perspective.", "The Philippines for example – I think there was this perception that the Philippines was casting aside the U.S. as its long-term ally, and moving close towards China in particular towards the end of last year.", "But if you look at developments more closely, you see that President Duterte was only trying, and is still only trying, to do is what many other Southeast countries have been doing for a very long time – which is trying to balance the major powers in the region.", "We’re all very small countries here, with maybe the exception of Indonesia. And under President Aquino, the Philippines was seen as completely being in the U.S. orbit, while President Duterte, in my view, is just trying to “rebalance” that relationship, so to speak, and trying to bring it back closer to the center, to reposition the Philippines among all these different and influential powers in the region while also trying to extract maximum benefits for the Philippines itself.", "For Vietnam, definitely the lifting of the arms embargo as conditional as it was, was still very significant.", "We know the bitter history between the U.S. and Vietnam. But, again, to cast this in light of this big U.S.-China rivalry is only one aspect of the consideration.", "Similarly, there has been a lot talk of Malaysia turning towards China because of all these deals. These are mostly economic deals and investment-based.", "But there was also the defense deal that was done during Prime Minister Najib’s official visit to Beijing in late October/early November 2016.", "The fact that Najib himself called it a “landmark deal” lent even more flavor to the idea that it was about Malaysia aligning itself more closely with China.", "But when you look more closely at the details, you will see that the China-Malaysia defense relationship is still very nascent and underwhelming, especially considering that China and Malaysia had signed a defense MOU back in 2005.", "It hasn’t really developed over the years, and it’s only been in recent times, during the last two to three years, that it culminated in a tabletop exercise and a command exercise, and from now on, on an annual basis, we will see joint exercises of friendship and cooperation.", "But this is really just a confidence building exercise that both the Chinese and Malaysian military is embarking on, really just trying to assess the comfort level between the two militaries.", "On the other hand, consider the fact that Malaysia has a long, established, solid defense relationship with the U.S., in particular, but also with other countries in the region – like Australia, Singapore, and New Zealand.", "If we view things more holistically and drill down to the details, you will see that the U.S. relationship with Southeast Asian states is still very significant, but I caution anyone against trying to understand national developments in the Philippines, Vietnam, Malaysia, Singapore, and Indonesia as mainly a U.S.-China-and-“pick your Southeast Asian country” trilateral relationship.", "It’s more about the national interest of each of the Southeast Asian states and how they position themselves between the major powers of the U.S. and China or try to optimize their national interest in the midst of all this rivalry.", "Mina: Thank you, Elina. And finally, Scott, taking a macro view of developments in the Asia-Pacific in 2016, how do you assess President Obama’s “rebalance”?", "Did the U.S. succeed in creating new partnerships and strengthening existing relationships in the naval domain?", "Have other U.S. allies or partners been successful in this regard? One of the most exciting stories early on in 2016 was whether Japan and Australia, two key US allies, would cooperate on submarine production, but that initiative fizzled.", "Is defense technology cooperation a feasible area for future U.S. leadership in the Asia-Pacific?", "Scott Cheney-Peters: Thank you so much for that. Absolutely so. I think the key underpinning of the strategic rationale of the “rebalance” was correct and it still holds true.", "And that is, that outside of North America, Asia will be the most important region for the U.S.’s security and its values.", "Dan Rather had a good piece in the Washington Post about how President Obama’s foreign policy focus was a little bit like Jon Snow’s from the Game of Thrones in that it was right in the big picture about the “rebalance” to Asia but a little bit negligent about the dangers of conflicting agendas.", "It talks about how things like the Iran deal could be seen in the framework of removing these distractions, but also how, despite these efforts, many real world events and folks with other goals, like Putin, get in the way of this vision.", "As such, the record in prioritizing and safeguarding U.S. interests in Asia against other threats has been something of a mixed bag.", "I’m going to focus on the security front in particular. And since my esteemed colleagues have talked a lot about China, I’m going to put that a little on the backburner, but it has brought us this focus through the “rebalance,” this enhanced substantial cooperation with many countries in the region including Japan, Australia, Vietnam, the Philippines, Singapore, Indonesia, India, Sri Lanka, and even China.", "But these gains can be seen as tactical and reversible – as we saw with Thailand and the coup, and in the Philippines as Elina alluded to, because our interest is not singular.", "It’s not just security, or economics, or values. It’s a mix of those because we understand the intertwined nature of these interests over the long run.", "While eight years without any major conflict in Asia during this past administration is not insubstantial, and several long-running internal disputes and boundary issues were resolved or moved closer to resolution, other security threats have increased.", "The U.S. is going to have to figure out how to deal with North Korea, which seems to be determined to pursue increasingly capable nuclear weapons.", "And as Jim and Greg alluded, also dealing with a China that is undertaking this campaign of maritime coercion while violating international norms and laws.", "In the maritime domain, there are non-state threats, such as resurgent piracy, kidnapping, and armed robbery at sea and increasingly aggressive competition for marine resources.", "We’re seeing also an influx of Islamist radicalism that could potentially inflame ongoing insurgencies in Thailand and the Philippines.", "Of late, we’ve also seen the potential for radicalization of the repressed Rohingya in Burma. So we’re seeing a lot of security threats and issues that have somewhat metastasized over the past several years.", "On other fronts, like economics, we obviously spent a lot of time and effort trying to develop the Trans-Pacific Partnership, which I understand now has been withdrawn prior to ratification and it remains to be what seen what will replace it – but that cannot be counted as a win for the “rebalance.”", "Regionally, we have seen a lot of participation by the U.S. in things that are going to build and strengthen regional framework for maritime security cooperation, things like the Maritime Security Initiative, the DoD-led initiative to help develop the maritime security capabilities of some of our Southeast Asian partners; ReCAAP, the regional agreement for countering piracy and armed robbery; and the ASEAN Regional Forum.", "These all have really gotten their feet under them, really developed, just over the past eight years or so.", "But without sustained diplomatic effort, which is one of the things the “rebalance” was good at investing, it remains to be seen how much further these can develop.", "The good news for the region is that, probably, other than the MSI, they can support themselves without U.S. support and participation, but certainly our involvement would help to mature and strengthen them.", "As to our partners, I think Japan has been quite successful in constructing maritime partnerships in part due to what I call “patrol boat diplomacy” of helping Southeast Asian partners develop their maritime capability on generous terms, whether it’s Vietnam, the Philippines or Malaysia.", "And this is something that Australia has also long undertaken, especially in the South Pacific. India has also been warming to this approach.", "We see a couple of new deals between India through no longer just its “look east” but also its “act east” policy.", "In the future we are likely to see all three continue to pursue maritime technology cooperation and defense export opportunities.", "I would add a caveat that the exact nature of those deals remain to be seen and will depend on the calculation of both sides, not just in terms of security considerations, but also, sometimes primarily, on", "domestic economic and political concerns – for things like shipbuilding jobs and technology transfers.", "I don’t know how much of a leadership role the U.S. will take in technology transfers or technology cooperation, but I remain optimistic about improved ties in technology cooperation with India, and what that means in terms of developing naval aviation capabilities.", "So that’s a broad stroke, and I’m looking forward to our discussion, I have some questions I want to ask our fellow panelists", "Mina: Great, thanks, Scott. I’m going to begin with one follow up question, and then we can have a little bit of a discussion.", "There’s still plenty of questions about what policies this administration will pursue, but I think we can already say that this administration will be characterized by unexpectedness, unpredictability, and misinformation.", "How are these traits of the Donald Trump administration going to shape how states in the Asia-Pacific, including key allies such as Japan, craft their maritime strategy and foreign policy?", "Scott: I’d like to put a spin on that question and shoot it over to Elina. I’m curious what you think the nations in Southeast Asia, what signals or messages from the United States will help them breathe a sigh of relief?", "Elina: I think that’s a tough one, Scott. As Mina pointed out there does seem to be a lot of unpredictability and uncertainty right now.", "We heard President Trump’s speech during his inauguration, and his emphasis on America First. I think what we can see in Southeast Asia – subject to whatever develops in the next few months – is that the relationship will be a transactional one as many people have said.", "And that transactional relationship will be dependent on how much the Trump administration can draw from its partners in Southeast Asia.", "Now this will be a bit of bargaining back and forth between Southeast Asia and the U.S. Obviously, the smaller Southeast Asian nations will not have the bargaining chips to play that the United States does.", "Some of the signs Southeast Asian states are looking for will not be forthcoming in the next few months, because I think they’re looking for signs of predictability, reassurance and stability – none of which has been present thus far.", "ASEAN in particular, given its fiftieth anniversary this year, will be looking for some form of commitment, at least the presence of President Trump at the EAS, and I’m not sure that we can even expect that.", "I know that in the past the U.S. has sort of downplayed the appearance of its leaders at events like the EAS and even senior officials at the ARF, but I think as we all know, in Southeast Asia just showing up is key.", "And at this stage, I don’t think we can even expect that come November.", "All the signs Southeast Asia is looking for – predictability, certainty, stability, assurance, it’s all coming now from the one unpredictable actor that was around and has been around and will continue to be around: China.", "In the past, we saw signs of reassurance from the U.S. against China, but now the situation seems to be reversed.", "Scott: That’s a great answer and great points. Greg, I’m wondering if you’ve seen to Elina’s point, any policies coming out from Trump’s administration pertaining to Asia outside the U.S.-China context.", "Greg: Well, no, not outside of the U.S.-China relationship. Despite its many shortcomings, the one thing the Pivot did quite well was focus on middle powers and Southeast Asia", "states. It situated China policy within Asia policy, not the other way around. So far, for Trump and most of his senior advisers and the transition team, what we’ve heard is an Asia policy almost entirely dominated by China with a sprinkling of North Korea.", "If you expect a transactional approach to interstate relations, which I think is reasonable, you’re perceived value vis-à-vis U.S.-China relations is going to determine your value to a large degree.", "If you’re sitting in a Southeast Asian capital, that’s the one thing that should really worry you. Elina mentioned the importance of just showing up in Asia – I don’t think we should expect Trump at the East Asia Summit.", "That seems extremely unlikely. We’re not going to see the same focus on Southeast Asian states, Australia, India, Japan except through that bilateral U.S.-China prism.", "The biggest factor of uncertainty though, is how much does the stated policy and platforms of the president-elect and nominee Trump actually translate into foreign policy?", "How much does President Trump want to be involved in foreign policy? We’ve certainly heard suggestions that he’s not going to play a very active role.", "He’s going to allow a much bigger role for players like Michael Flynn, the NSC, Mike Pence, and General Mattis, so it is possible that all of these statements from the president don’t actually frame the way the president pursues foreign policy.", "Mina: That makes a lot sense – just from the flip-flopping we’ve been seeing between the campaign and what is now a two-days-old presidency at the time of this recording.", "I’m still curious how states are reacting to the U.S., but breaking out of Southeast Asia, what are the signs that Japan and Taiwan in Northeast Asia are looking for?", "We haven’t really touched on the East China Sea but that’s also a hot spot in the Asia-Pacific that has gotten increasingly tense over the past year.", "Scott: Jim, maybe that’s an opportunity for you to jump in here. You mention the Red Star Rising, but perhaps you could provide a little more context for our listeners about that and if you’ve seen any discussion about the role of Taiwan in the new administration.", "Jim: First of all, the Red Star Rising is just an email distribution list that I’ve had going on for 11 years.", "Got a number of people at State, DOD, academia and the press, and people in theater, in the country and regions are on the list so we try to follow things from their perspective.", "Anybody listening to this send us an email at kimo.fanell@gmail.com and we’ll add you to the list.", "Second, before we get to Taiwan, I would like to give an alternative view about the characterization of the Trump administration.", "One, Mina said it, they’ve been in power a day and a half. Two, if you go back and look at the Obama administration’s announcement of the rebalance or the pivot that was a year and a half into his administration before it was announced, and it was certainly another two years before we started seeing tangible aspects of that policy being implemented.", "I would caution people not just in the United States but also overseas to give it a little more of a “breather” here.", "There have been no stated policies on anything, so to make judgments about what these will be and to make assumptions that everything is going to be transactional is very premature.", "Especially when you listen to testimonies of Secretary of Defense Mattis and Secretary of State nominee Tillerson, their comments reflect an understanding of the requirements and necessities to sustain our alliance structure.", "General Mattis’ first statement yesterday after he was confirmed, he said to the Department of Defense “I’m glad to be working with you,”", "and to the people of the intelligence community, and the last portion of that two or three sentence message to the Department, he said we need to have “friends and alliances,” so I think we need to see US foreign policy through the lens of greater continuity in the post-WWII environment.", "In my opinion, our commitment to the international order is not going to be upended, and take it for what it’s worth, but I think that’s the message you’ll be seeing coming out of this new administration.", "There will be parts of it that will echo and reinforce what the president-elect said, but I didn’t hear those statements even in the Inauguration speech.", "He talked about America not forcing its view on other countries, but I think there’s a lot there to work with.", "People may not like all that is said, but there is a longer continuity to history.", "With respect to Taiwan, I do think it’s an area where this new administration is not going to be constrained by previous history.", "I’m kind of undercutting what I just said, but I think it’s very clear what happened is not just happenstance, and we can expect to see more direct challenges to the idea that the United States cannot deal with and talk to Taiwan.", "I think there’s been a lot of discussion about what is the “One China” policy. And if you go back and look at the original statements from the 70s, we said we accepted the understanding that China believed Taiwan was part of China, but we were not making a judgment on that.", "I think that hasn’t been focused on in the past two, three decades, but I think that will be under discussion again and that will certainly upset Beijing.", "I think the purposes for that, you may attribute to transactional relationships in other aspects, like economics.", "I think this new administration is going to challenge China on its unwillingness to uphold the international order – such as their unwillingness to follow the PCA ruling – and they might do that through an indirect or asymmetric approach.", "Mina: Thank you very much. I’m sure our listeners will appreciate this. And now finally, before we sign off, I have one last question for each of our panelists, in the same order as initial responses, and it is, what project are you most excited to be working on this year, that CIMSEC readers and listeners should keep an eye on?", "Jim: I’m always working on all kinds of different things, but I think my focus will stay on watching what the Chinese Navy is doing in terms of enforcing their view of the task to rejuvenate and restore China, including in their maritime domains.", "Greg: Not to parrot Jim’s answer but me personally and at AMTI, we will be looking to do more of the same.", "We’re looking to boost readership of the site, increase our ability to bring pressure and transparency.", "Part of this is, for instance, we just launched multilingual versions of the website in Chinese, Malay and Vietnamese to drive readership outside of the United States.", "We’re also looking to do a couple new projects that move beyond just pulling back the curtain on what China’s doing in the South China Sea but look at, well, what do we do about that, beyond just the military realm, which is what we have been working on.", "We want to look at environmental issues, legal issues, law enforcement, et cetera.", "Elina: I’m excited to be focusing more on cyber issues. It doesn’t have direct links to what we are talking about now, maritime security, but as you know, operations in cyber space cut across all traditional domains.", "So in the next few months, you will hear about a global commission on stability in cyberspace being announced.", "I don’t want to preempt or undercut any public announcement, but I think you will hear exciting news coming from that", "space, and I will particularly be helping try to craft norms and rules for state behavior in cyberspace and international relations.", "Scott: Those all sound like fascinating projects, and I look forward to learning more about those. I do want to take the opportunity to thank my co-panelists and colleagues for joining us on this podcast and for those listeners out there, if you are interested in heading out – especially in DC – to any CIMSEC events, we often get the opportunity to host some of these great thinkers in more informal discussions and more give-and-take in person events.", "For myself, I am looking forward to continuing on our work on the Crowded Seas project, which is looking at the maritime domain in Asia in the 2030-2040 timeframe and looking at some of the potential security implications.", "If you haven’t had a chance yet, you can take a look at the amazing, speculative fiction that I’ve written with my colleague Richard Lum on our website.", "Feedback is appreciated. Don’t expect any Pulitzer prize-winning writing, it’s just for fun, but we will have a more serious think tank take a look at our more creative approaches to the problem.", "With that, I’m going to thank Mina and turn it back to her.", "Mina: Thank you. It looks like there’s a lot for our listeners and readers to look forward to coming out of your projects.", "Again, thank you so much to all our panelists for joining us on this call, and I can’t wait to get this out to our listeners!", "Mina Pollmann is CIMSEC’s Director of External Relations.", "Comments By Ms Elina Nor during an Interview with Center for International Maritime Security, 6 February 2017 (transcript and audio podcast)"]}

(Operator Instructions) We'll now take our first question from Oliver Chen from Cowen & Co. Please go ahead.", "Hi. Thank you. Good morning. We are curious about your views on the U.S. wholesale channel, and how you see that trending in the year ahead, and your thoughts on inventory control within that channel?", "Also, as you look across globally, there's a number of macro risk. If you could speak to your thoughts about UK, France and how the Chinese consumer is behaving as it reflects on your business, that would be helpful as well?", "Efraim Grinberg -- Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Okay. Thank you, Oliver. Well, let me start with -- there's obviously risk in the U.S. today, and you're seeing that in economic numbers, and people believe that there's going to be a slow down in traffic patterns to stores.", "So we've taken -- taking that into account in our own forecasts, and when there is risk, people are obviously inventory conscious, inventories are in good shape.", "But we've outperformed the market, and our intention is to aggressively stand behind our brands to continue to outperform the market and invest in them.", "Europe has seemed for us to be -- we've taken a lot of market share and our growth in Europe has continued even in a challenging environment.", "So, I believe in the watch category and in the fashion watch category, we were one of the bright spots for our retail partners in Europe.", "And China for us is still a very small environment. So again, we have opportunity there to gain share despite what goes on in the market.", "And on the smart watch innovation and the announcements you're making, what is your approach to thinking about how big or incremental this should be as a percentage of total, and how you inventory into these -- into this group of watches just to both mitigate risk but also pursue the right level of innovation?", "Efraim Grinberg -- Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "So, we're excited about our smart watches, they'll come for the second half of the year. What we have found in smart watches is that they do extremely well for the first and second season, and then get a little more challenging afterwards as you need to bring more innovation into the marketplace.", "So we're doing that. And we believe we're inventory -- inventorying it properly and standing behind a strong marketing program in the second half of the year to support that with our retailers.", "The Olivia Burton, Tmall word was also very impressive. What are your thoughts for the Olivia Burton geographic breakout over time and other learnings there that help you with balancing your portfolio as well?", "Efraim Grinberg -- Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "I think we found that the Asian market overall has been very, very receptive to Olivia Burton and help drive some healthy growth.", "But still it's one of the most -- Olivia Burton is one of the most significant fashion watch brands in the UK, and growing its presence in Europe, and this year, we're focused on really beginning to build brand awareness in the U.S. and driving growth in the U.S., behind Olivia Burton as well.", "Efraim Grinberg -- Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Thank you. We'll now take our next question from Frank Camma from Sidoti. Please go ahead. Your line is open.'", "Good morning, guys. Thanks for taking the questions. First, I'd like to start with just a guidance. Can you just remind us with MVMT, the seasonality of that because I know it's different than your base business and how that's reflected in your guidance.", "Correct. So, I'm going to start with that, and I'm sure Efraim will go in. So, MVMT is a very seasonal business right now with our e-commerce where the -- and we mentioned this as we were purchasing them, they are very active in the back half of the year, the last three to four months during the holiday selling season.", "So that will impact the seasonality, and of course, that will be anniversaried next year in the back half of the year with the timing of when we acquired them this year.", "Efraim Grinberg -- Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Efraim Grinberg -- Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Okay.

It's a combination of digital spending, which remember, we didn't have MVMT during the first half of the year.", "So there's a significant investment anniversarying with they do. But also, we've begun to use television as an outdoor as well as influencer campaign to -- as the effective vehicles to reach consumers.", "So we will invest behind that. And as you can see, we're adding a Movado television campaign in the spring to our fall campaign.", "We're excited about that. But those do take investments.", "Okay.

Market Power and Monopoly PowerMarket power is a seller's ability to exercise some control over the price it charges.", "In our economy, few firms are pure price takers facing perfectly elastic demand.(6) For example, the unique location of a dry cleaner may confer slight market power because some customers are willing to pay a little more rather than walk an extra block or two to the next-closest dry cleaner.", "Economists say the dry cleaner possesses market power, if only to a trivial degree. Virtually all products that are differentiated from one another, if only because of consumer tastes, seller reputation, or producer location, convey upon their sellers at least some degree of market power.", "Thus, a small degree of market power is very common and understood not to warrant antitrust intervention.(7) Market power and monopoly power are related but not the same.", "The Supreme Court has defined market power as \"the ability to raise prices above those that would be charged in a competitive market,\"(8) and monopoly power as \"the power to control prices or exclude competition.", "\"(9) The Supreme Court has held that \"[m]onopoly power under § 2 requires, of course, something greater than market power under § 1.\"(10) Precisely where market power becomes so great as to constitute what the law deems to be monopoly power is largely a matter of degree rather than one of kind.", "Clearly, however, monopoly power requires, at a minimum, a substantial degree of market power.(11) Moreover, before subjecting a firm to possible challenge under antitrust law for monopolization or attempted monopolization, the power in question is generally required to be much more than merely fleeting; that is, it must also be durable.(12)", "Although monopoly power will generally result in the setting of prices above competitive levels, the desire to obtain profits that derive from a monopoly position provides a critical incentive for firms to invest and create the valuable products and processes that drive economic growth.(13)", "For this reason, antitrust law does not regard as illegal the mere possession of monopoly power where it is the product of superior skill, foresight, or industry.(14) Where monopoly power is acquired or maintained through anticompetitive conduct, however, antitrust law properly objects.", "Section 2's requirement that single-firm conduct create or maintain, or present a dangerous probability of creating, monopoly power serves as an important screen for evaluating single-firm liability.", "Permitting conduct that likely creates at most an ability to exercise a minor degree of market power significantly reduces the possibility of discouraging \"the competitive enthusiasm that the antitrust laws seek to promote\"(15) and assures the majority of competitors that their unilateral actions will not violate section 2.", "It also reduces enforcement costs, including costs associated with devising and policing remedies. The costs that firms, courts, and competition authorities would incur in identifying and litigating liability, as well as devising and policing remedies for any and all conduct with the potential to have a minor negative impact on competition for short periods, would almost certainly far outweigh the benefits, particularly if the calculus includes, as it should, the loss of procompetitive activity that would inevitably be discouraged in such a system.", "III. Identifying Monopoly PowerMonopoly power is conventionally demonstrated by showing that both (1) the firm has (or in the case of attempted monopolization, has a dangerous probability of attaining) a high share of a relevant market and (2) there are entry ba", "The Guidelines go on to explain that in implementing this definition, the agencies \"use prevailing prices.", "\"(57) In the section 2 context, however, if the inquiry is being conducted after monopoly power has already been exercised, using prevailing prices can lead to defining markets too broadly and thus inferring that monopoly power does not exist when, in fact, it does.(58)", "The problem with using prevailing prices to define the market in a monopoly-maintenance case is known as the \"Cellophane Fallacy\" because it arose in a case involving cellophane, where an issue before the Supreme Court was whether the relevant market was cellophane or all flexible-packaging materials.(59) During the relevant period, du Pont produced over seventy percent of the cellophane in the United States.(60)", "Cellophane, however, \"constituted less than 20% of all 'flexible packaging material' sales. \"(61) The Court concluded that cellophane's interchangeability with other materials made it part of a broader, flexible-packaging market.", "Many have criticized the Court's reasoning because it assessed the alternatives for cellophane after du Pont already had raised its price to the monopoly level, failing to recognize that a firm with monopoly power finds it profitable to raise price--above the competitive level--until demand becomes elastic.", "Hence, it should not be at all surprising to find that at the monopoly price the firm faces close substitutes and would not be able profitably to raise price further.(62)", "\"Because every monopolist faces an elastic demand . . . at its profit-maximizing output and price, there is bound to be some substitution of other products for its own when it is maximizing profits, even if it has great market power.", "\"(63) One panelist suggested using the hypothetical-monopolist paradigm in certain monopoly-acquisition cases, defining the relevant market as of a time before the challenged conduct began and carrying forward the resulting market definition to the present to assess whether the firm possesses monopoly power.(64)", "This suggestion is sound in theory. Unfortunately, however, substantial practical problems may make it difficult to determine consumers' preferences and other relevant factors as of some prior date, thereby impeding the ability to conduct an accurate \"but-for\" exercise.(65)", "Moreover, the market definition as of the pre-conduct time may no longer be relevant because of intervening new product introductions or other significant changes in the marketplace.", "An additional problem concerns allegations of monopoly maintenance where the conduct in question allegedly has maintained preexisting monopoly power rather than created that power.", "One possibility is to apply the hypothetical-monopolist paradigm of the Horizontal Merger Guidelines just as in merger cases, except at the competitive price rather than the prevailing price.", "However, accurately determining the competitive price is apt to be quite difficult in such cases. Despite its limitations in the section 2 context, there exists no clear and widely accepted alternative to the hypothetical-monopolist methodology for defining relevant markets.(66)", "Some commentators suggest that, for all its limitations, the hypothetical-monopolist paradigm still has value in monopolization cases.(67)", "It appropriately focuses the market-definition process on market-power considerations and thereby helps to avoid ad hoc conclusions regarding the boundaries of the market and the effects of the conduct.", "Moreover, and importantly, concerns over the Cellophane Fallacy need not confound market definition in all section 2 cases.", "Panelists observed that, although there may be no reliable paradigm for defining the relevant market in every case, courts often are able to draw sound conclusions about the relevant market based on the facts and circumstances of the industry.(68)", "Furthermore, \"[T]he issue in many cases arising under Section 2 of the Sherman Act is whether ongoing or threatened conduct, if left unchecked, would create monopoly power--not whether the defendant already possesses monopoly power.", "\"(69) In particular, Cellophane considerations present less of a problem in attempted monopolization cases where monopoly prices are either not yet being charged or where competitive prices were being charged in the not-too-distant pre-conduct past.", "The Department believes that market definition remains an important aspect of section 2 enforcement and that continued consideration and study is warranted regarding how to appropriately determine relevant markets in this context.", "V. Other Approaches to Identifying Monopoly PowerAs noted above, courts typically determine whether a firm possesses monopoly power by first ascertaining the relevant market and then examining market shares, entry conditions, and other factors with respect to that market.", "One important issue is whether plaintiffs should instead be permitted to demonstrate monopoly power solely through direct evidence--for exa"]}

Assessment of compliance was problematic due to the marked variation in reporting of this method, which reflects a lack of standardised reporting requirements for the PDSA method.", "From the articles that reported details of PDSA cycles it was possible to ascertain that variation is inherent not just in reporting standards, but in the conduct of the method, implying that the key principles of the PDSA method are frequently not followed.", "Less than 20% (14/73) of reviewed articles reported the conduct of iterative cycles of change, and of these, only 15% (2/14) used initial small-scale tests with increasing scale as confidence in the intervention developed.", "These results suggest that the full benefits of the PDSA method would probably not have been realised in these studies.", "Without an iterative approach, learning from one cycle is not used to inform the next cycle, and therefore it is unlikely that interventions will be adapted and optimised for use in a particular setting.", "Furthermore, large-scale cycles risk significant resource investment in an intervention that has not been tested and optimised within that environment and risk producing ‘false’ negatives.", "Only 14% (7/47) of articles reported use of regular data over time at monthly or more frequent intervals, indicating a lack of understanding around the use of the PDSA method to track change within a ‘live’ system, and limiting the ability to interpret the results from the study.", "Cycles that included an explicit prediction of outcomes were reported in only 9% (4/47) of articles, suggesting that PDSA cycles were not used as learning cycles to test and revise theory-based predictions.", "Overall these results demonstrate poor compliance with key principles of the PDSA method, suggesting that it is not being used optimally.", "The increasing trend in using PDSA (as opposed to ‘PDCA’) cycles in recent years, however, does seem to have been accompanied by an increase in compliance with some key principles, such as use of iterative cycles.", "Deming was cautious over the use of the ‘PDCA’ terminology and warned it referred to an explicitly different process, referring to a quality control circle for dealing with faults within a system, rather than the PDSA process, which was intended for iterative learning and improvement of a product or a process.39 This subtle difference in terminologies may help to explain the better compliance with key methodological principles in studies that refer to the method as ‘PDSA’.", "One of the articles identified in the search included comments by the authors that the PDSA method should be ‘more realistically represented’,40 as ineffective cycles can be ‘abandoned’ early on, making it needless to go through all four stages in each iteration.", "These comments may provide insight into an important potential misunderstanding of the PDSA methodology.", "Ineffective changes will result in learning, which is a fundamental principle behind a PDSA cycle. However minor this abandoned trial may have been, it can still be usefully described as a PDSA cycle.", "A minor intervention may be planned (P) and put into practice (D). A barrier may be encountered (S), resulting in a decision being made to retract the intervention, and to do something differently (A).", "The theoretical framework presented in this paper highlights the complexity of PDSA cycles and the underpinning knowledge required for correct application.", "The considerable variation in application observed in the reported literature suggests that caution should be taken in interpreting results from evaluations in which PDSAs are used in a controlled setting and as a ‘black box’ of QI.", "This review did not compare the effectiveness of use to reported outcomes and therefore this study does not conclude whether better application of the PDSA method results in better outcomes, but instead draws on theoretical principles of PDSAs to rationalise why this would be expected.", "Prospective mechanistic studies exploring the effective application of the method as well as study outcomes would be of greater use in drawing conclusions regarding the effectiveness of the method.", "The framework presented in this paper could act as a good starting point for such studies.", "The fact that only peer-reviewed publications were assessed in this study means that results may be affected by publication bias.", "This is anticipated both in terms of what is accepted for publication but also the level and type of detail that is requested and allowed in typical publications (eg, before and after studies are more common than presenting data over time and this may make these types of studies easier to publish).", "Though QI work may be easier to publish now through recent changes in publication guidelines,27 possible publication outlets continue to be relatively limited.", "To support systematic reporting and encourage appropriate usage, we suggest that reporting guidelines be produced for users of the PDSA method to increase transparency as to the issues that were encountered and how they were resolved.", "While PDSA is analogous to a scientific method, it appears to be rarely used or reported with scientific rigour, which in turn, inhibits perceptions of PDSA as a scientific method.", "Such guidelines are essential to increase the scientific legitimacy of the PDSA method as well as to improve scientific rigour or application and reporting.", "Although the SQUIRE guidelines make reference to the potential use of PDSA cycles, further support to users and teachers, and publication of this improvement method seems necessary.", "Consistent reporting of PDSA structure would allow meta-evaluation and systematic reviews to further build the knowledge of how to use such methods effectively and the principles to apply to increase chances of success.", "It is clear from these findings that there is much room for improvement in the application and use of the PDSA method.", "Previous studies have discussed the influence of different context factors on the use of QI methods, such as motivation, data support infrastructure and leadership20 22 41–43 Understanding how high-quality usage can be promoted and supported needs to become the focus of further research if such QI methods are going to be used effectively in mainstream healthcare.", "There is varied application and reporting of PDSAs and lack of compliance with the principles that underpin its design as a pragmatic scientific method.", "The varied practice compromises its effectiveness as a method for improvement and cautions against studies that view QI or PDSA as a ‘black box’ intervention.", "There is an urgent need for greater scientific rigour in the application and reporting of these methods to advance the understanding of the science of improvement and efficacy of the PDSA method.", "The PDSA method should be applied with greater consistency and with greater accordance to guidelines provided by founders and commentators25 30 44 45", "The authors would like to thank Dr Thomas Woodcock for his valuable input into the theoretical framework and data analysis.", "Contributors: All listed authors qualify for authorship based on making one or more of the substantial contributions to the intellectual content: conceptual design (MJT, CM, CN, DB, AD and JR), acquisition of data (MJT, CM and CN) and/or analysis and interpretation of data (MJT, CM, CN and JR).", "Furthermore all authors participated in drafting the manuscript (MJT, CM, CN, DB, AD and JR) and critical revision of the manuscript for important intellectual content (MJT, CM, CN, DB, AD and JR).", "Disclaimer: This article presents independent research commissioned by the National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) under the Collaborations for Leadership in Applied Health Research and Care (CLAHRC) programme for North West London.", "The views expressed in this publication are those of the author(s) and not necessarily those of the NHS, the NIHR or the Department of Health.", "Competing interests: The authors declare no conflict of interest.", "Provenance and peer review: Not commissioned;

Instead, there remains a smattering of business review letters, statements, and enforcement actions (now including the Qualcomm case) that were not incorporated into the Guidelines notwithstanding calls to do so, for example, from noted economists, Farrell and Shapiro.", "It also comes just three days prior to the inauguration of Donald Trump, and shortly before the departure of Obama appointee and current FTC Chairwoman, Edith Ramirez.", "Notably, issuance of the complaint was authorized by a 2-to-1 vote of the Commission (therefore hinging on the vote of Ramirez), with a written dissent by Commissioner Maureen Ohlhausen.", "In the Qualcomm complaint, the FTC alleges that Qualcomm possesses “monopoly and market power” in the markets for baseband processors complying with the CDMA and LTE standards.", "It allegedly abuses that market power in three ways:", "First, by conditioning OEM access to its baseband processors on their agreement to its “no license, no chips” terms, which allegedly acts as a “tax” that raises OEM’s cost of constructing and selling handsets and that includes payment of royalties to Qualcomm on sales of handsets that incorporate a competing baseband processor;", "Second, by refusing to license SEPs to competitors (either at all or on FRAND terms), including Intel and Samsung, Qualcomm maintained its monopoly on baseband processors and effectively “taxed” its competitors’ sales to OEMs;", "Third, by “extracting” exclusivity from Apple in exchange for partial royalty relief, Qualcomm, in effect, penalized Apple for using any baseband processor supplied by Qualcomm’s competitors.", "In doing so, Qualcomm excluded its competitors from selling to a uniquely important OEM, thereby weakening their ability to market their products to other OEMs.", "The harms that the complaint alleges have arisen from this conduct include the raising of prices charged to OEMs and, consequently, to end-users; the weakening of demand for baseband processors overall due to higher acquisition costs; the exiting from the market of certain of Qualcomm’s competitors; increased margin pressure on the remaining competitors; and the suppression of innovation in mobile technologies.", "FTC staff will, undoubtedly, characterize its complaint against Qualcomm as the mere application of traditional antitrust principles to conduct that just happens to involve intellectual property licensing.", "If that were the case, then it should have been uncontroversial to include a discussion of these types of practices in the revised Guidelines as suggested by commenters.", "But, notwithstanding the revised Guidelines’ silence on the issue, the Qualcomm case shows once again that the FTC does in fact see SEPs as a special-case application of Section 5 of the FTC act.", "Tellingly, the complaint describes (at para. 49) the FTC’s view of the problem:", "Standard-setting participants often hold patents covering technologies that are incorporated into a standard.", "Once a standard incorporating proprietary technology is adopted, the potential exists for opportunistic patent holders to insist on patent licensing terms that capture not just the value of the underlying technology, but also the value of standardization itself.", "To address this “hold-up” risk, SSOs often require patent holders to disclose their patents and commit to license standard-essential patents (“SEPs”) on fair, reasonable, and non-discriminatory (“FRAND”) terms.", "Absent such requirements, a patent holder might be able to parlay the standardization of its technology into a monopoly in standard-compliant products.", "This further confirms the current FTC’s view that, by operation of the antitrust laws and the FTC Act, a patent holder surrenders its right to exclude — the very essence of the patent right itself — if it agrees to contribute its technology to a standard.", "We have discussed the various expressions of that view in a prior article here. Many in the field believe that this is a substantive interpretation of the law that requires more, and more public discussion and analysis prior to its application to rights holders in the everyday practice of their trade, particularly given the lack of evidence that “patent holdup” is a significant or pervasive problem.", "It was this very lack of evidence of anticompetitive effects in the Qualcomm case that led Commissioner Ohlhausen to issue a written dissent decrying the lack of facts or economic analysis to show that Qualcomm’s licensing practices led to the alleged anticompetitive harms in the marketplace.", "Her dissent recognizes the right of SEP holders to monetize their investments, stating that “reasonable royalties are not an exclusionary tax, even if paid by competitors.”", "But she does not dispute — at least not expressly — the complaint’s underlying premise that the holder of an SEP gives up its right to exclude others when it contributes its patent to the standard.", "Assuming that the Trump FTC continues to prosecute the Qualcomm case — which is far from a certainty — resolution of the case will provide key guidance on the appropriate treatment of SEPs under the antitrust laws and the FTC Act."]}

(the Order) is the latest in a series of significant actions and statements regarding the national security implications of trade policy.", "In December 2017, the president released his National Security Strategy, emphasizing economic security as a key component of national security, and specifically focusing on the regulation of international trade and foreign investment as a way to secure U.S. military and technological superiority.", "On March 12, 2018, President Trump issued the Order, citing national security concerns raised by Broadcom’s potential acquisition of Qualcomm.", "These actions, coupled with recently announced tariffs on steel and aluminum as well as a Section 301 investigation into China’s intellectual property practices, illustrate that economic and trade issues are at the forefront of the Trump administration’s national security policy.", "These actions illustrate that economic and trade issues are at the forefront of the Trump administration’s national security policy.", "They also indicate that the president is willing to use the significant power he possesses to police foreign investment, primarily in the form of the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS), to advance the economic aspects of his national security policy.", "In the newly released National Security Strategy, the Trump administration identified the three main challenges to U.S. national security as “the revisionist powers of China and Russia, the rogue states of Iran and North Korea, and transnational threat organizations, particularly jihadist terrorist groups.”", "The National Security Strategy is a congressional mandate derived from the Goldwater-Nichols Act, which requires the White House to produce an annual report to Congress on the country’s “worldwide interests, goals, and objectives” and propose short- and long-term uses of the “political, economic, military, and other elements of the national power.”", "The strategy must also communicate the U.S. defense capabilities necessary to deter aggression and the adequacy of such capabilities.", "Although the Goldwater-Nichols Act originally required annual reports to Congress, recent presidential administrations have produced such strategies on only a periodic basis.", "The December 2017 strategy cautioned that “American prosperity and security are challenged by ... economic competition.”", "The strategy focused heavily on China’s theft and exploitation of intellectual property, though it also acknowledged that “some actors use largely legitimate, legal transfers and relationships to gain access to fields, experts, and trusted foundries that fill their capability gaps.”", "This was possibly an allusion to gaps in the jurisdiction of CFIUS, the interagency committee tasked with reviewing the national security implications of cross-border transactions.", "The Trump administration also expressed concern as to the potential exploitation of U.S. personal data, stating that China is determined “to control information and data” by gathering data on an unrivaled scale.", "In order to mitigate the perceived threats, the strategy signals that the administration intends to work with Congress to strengthen CFIUS while maintaining an investor-friendly climate.1 Additionally, the strategy indicates that the administration will explore new legal and regulatory regimes to prevent and prosecute intellectual property violations, including establishing procedures to reduce “economic theft by non-traditional intelligence collectors.”", "Evidence of such measures include the recent initiation of trade investigations into Chinese practices as they relate to technology transfer, intellectual property and innovation, and the increasing complexity of CFIUS investigations involving Chinese entities.", "Broadcom, with a market capitalization of roughly $107 billion, is the eighth-largest chipmaker in the world.", "The company, formerly named Avago, is the product of numerous acquisitions — most notably its $37 billion acquisition of California-based Broadcom in 2016, from which it gained its current name.", "Avago began life as an independent, Singapore-incorporated public company when it was spun out of U.S.-based Agilent (itself earlier spun out of Hewlett-Packard) in 2005.", "At the time, and since, Avago had little connection to Singapore other than its jurisdiction of incorporation, and the majority of its personnel and facilities remained in the United States.", "On November 2, 2017, Broadcom CEO Hock Tan — alongside President Trump, in the Oval Office — announced Broadcom’s plan to redomicile in the United States from Singapore.", "Within days of its redomiciling announcement, Broadcom disclosed its hostile bid for Qualcomm. Qualcomm developed 2G and 3G wireless technology and is currently a leader in the development of 5G technology.", "Qualcomm resisted Broadcom’s bid, which resulted in Broadcom revising its bid on two separate occasions, for a final announced value of $117 billion.", "As part of its takeover bid, Broadcom initiated a proxy solicitation designed to elect six new directors selected by Broadcom to Qualcomm’s board.", "If all were elected, they would have represented a majority of Qualcomm’s board.", "On January 29, 2018, Qualcomm submitted a unilateral CFIUS notice requesting review of Broadcom’s actions aimed at electing a majority of directors at Qualcomm.", "CFIUS proceeded to review the proposed transaction and solicited information through phone calls, emails and meetings with both parties.", "On February 21, 2018, and March 2, 2018, Broadcom submitted letters to CFIUS with information relevant to the review.", "Broadcom’s bid also faced political opposition. Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, one of the key sponsors of CFIUS reform, and Rep. Duncan Hunter, R-Calif., wrote letters urging the treasury secretary to review the proposed transaction ahead of an important Qualcomm shareholder vote scheduled for March 6, 2018.", "Notably, Sen. Cornyn’s letter argued that Broadcom would drastically cut Qualcomm’s investment in 5G wireless technology research and development, creating a market opening for China’s Huawei to move into a dominant position, potentially threatening U.S. national security.", "On March 4, 2018, CFIUS filed an agency notice to broaden the scope of its review to cover the proposed hostile takeover itself.", "CFIUS also issued an interim order to the parties directing that Qualcomm’s annual stockholder meeting scheduled for March 6, 2018, be adjourned for 30 days to allow for further investigation by CFIUS.", "The interim order stipulated that Broadcom provide five business days’ notice before taking any action to relocate to the United States.", "In a March 5, 2018, letter addressed to the parties, CFIUS enumerated several concerns with the transaction that it believed warranted a full investigation.", "These concerns included: (1) Broadcom’s reputation for reducing research and development, and the national security risk if China dominates the 5G space; (2) the amount of debt financing — $106 billion, the largest corporate acquisition loan on record — driving pressure for short-term profits; and (3) a potential disruption in supply to critical Department of Defense and other government contracts.", "In addition, the letter highlighted the ways in which CFIUS viewed Qualcomm as a preferred partner and provider of technology for U.S. infrastructure.", "On March 8, 2018, CFIUS informed Broadcom that certain actions it had taken in furtherance of its efforts to relocate to the United States violated the five-business-day notice requirement from the interim order (e.g., participation in a Singapore court hearing and a filing to convene a Broadcom shareholder vote on the redomiciliation on March 23, 2018).", "On March 10, 2018, Broadcom authored an open letter to the U.S. Congress promising to: (1) invest $1.5 billion in training and education for U.S. engineers; (2) not sell any critical national security assets to foreign buyers; (3) annually invest $3 billion in research and engineering after relocation; and (4) annually invest $6 billion in manufacturing from its future U.S. location.", "The letter highlighted Broadcom’s strong ties to the United States, including: (1) management by a board and executives, a majority of whom are U.S. citizens; (2) ownership by shareholders, 90 percent of whom are in the United States and are largely the same as Qualcomm shareholders; and (3) employment of a workforce, with more than half of its employees already located in the United States.", "The letter also indicated Broadcom was in the final stages of relocating its domicile to the United States with an expected completion date of May 6, 2018.", "On March 11, 2018, the Treasury Department sent the parties a letter updating them on the status of the CFIUS investigation.", "The letter listed alleged violations to the CFIUS interim order, including Broadcom’s filing and dissemination of a definitive proxy statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission on March 9, 2018.", "CFIUS thus required the parties to provide all responsive information relating to its concerns set forth in its March 5, 2018, letter by noon on March 12, 2018.", "Finally, CFIUS noted that “[i]n absence of information that changes CFIUS’ assessment of the national security risks posed by this transaction, CFIUS would consider taking further action, including but not limited to referring the transaction to the President for decision.”", "On March 12, 2018, after CFIUS had met with Broadcom, the president issued the order blocking the transaction.", "Specifically, the Order stated that “[Broadcom] and Qualcomm shall immediately and permanently abandon the proposed takeover.”", "The Order also stipulated that all 15 individuals listed on the proxy card filed by Broadcom were disqualified from standing for election as directors of Qualcomm and that Qualcomm was prohibited from accepting nominations or votes for any of those candidates.", "Unprecedented Action Spurred by Jurisdictional Challenge?", "A presidential order blocking a transaction is unusual, with only five occurring in CFIUS’ history. In this case, the Order was truly unprecedented, marking the first time in CFIUS’ history that a transaction was blocked before an acquisition agreement was even signed.", "Although CFIUS does not explain its jurisdictional theory, it is likely that it viewed the impending election of Broadcom-sponsored directors as potentially giving Broadcom influence or control over Qualcomm and thus provided sufficient justification for its intervention.", "Moreover, CFIUS was undoubtedly aware of the impending limits of its jurisdiction based on Broadcom’s announced — and then accelerated — redomiciling to the United States.", "CFIUS’ authorizing statute empowers CFIUS and the president to act in investments made by foreign parties; given the totality of circumstances, it would be exceedingly difficult for CFIUS to claim Broadcom as a foreign party once it redomiciled in the United States.", "Thus, CFIUS likely believed it faced a do-or-die moment: block the transaction at an early stage or potentially lose all ability to influence the outcome of the transaction.", "It recommended the former, and the president acted accordingly.", "Expanding Scope of CFIUS’ Concerns Regarding China", "Although many in the press — undoubtedly in part because of CFIUS’ explicit reference — have characterized the president’s action as being motivated by concerns over China, Broadcom is not a Chinese entity and, to a great extent, its apparent ties to China look much like Qualcomm’s and many other non-Chinese global technology companies’.", "In this regard, CFIUS’ action highlights how its current view of concerns regarding China is expanding and may encompass a wide range of companies that — even if not Chinese — do business with or in China and hence, in CFIUS’ view, may be susceptible to Chinese influence in a manner that is detrimental to U.S. national security.", "The Order also illustrates how CFIUS’ inherent characteristics could make it an attractive trade policy tool during periods of heightened trade and national security tensions.", "Unlike many other trade authorities, CFIUS is a relatively speedy, case-by-case authority with little precedent of judicial review.", "It is also far more efficient than other governmental trade authorities. The remarkable speed with which CFIUS advanced this matter to the president, and his correspondingly rapid action blocking the transaction, provides a degree of policy responsiveness that is largely absent across the rest of the U.S. government.", "This case, however, also illustrates CFIUS’ inherent limitations to address broader concerns over domestic capabilities and capacity.", "Much of the justification found in CFIUS’ statements, as well as the argument included in congressional letters concerning the risks of the transaction, would apply equally to a purely domestic acquisition of Qualcomm by a U.S. company.", "Were a U.S. company to acquire Qualcomm with a “private equity-style direction” — as phrased by CFIUS — or purchase Qualcomm with an eye to radically reduce research and development spending, CFIUS would have no recourse.", "Thus, although in this case CFIUS was well-positioned to address perceived concerns, it is clearly insufficient to address the broader set of concerns identified in the December 2017 National Security Strategy and implicated by the United States’ declining technology edge in key areas of national security.", "We believe the Order is reflective of a significant change in CFIUS’ perspective on the national security risk of foreign investment in the United States and the use of CFIUS to advance the economic aspects of the administration’s national security policy.", "Others, however, have a legitimate belief that a variety of specific factors demonstrate that the Order does not represent a radical change for CFIUS.", "For example, Broadcom’s move to redomicile added significant complexity to the CFIUS-related issues and undoubtedly led to a hurried consideration of the substantive outcome of CFIUS’ response.", "In addition, the technology involved has long been central to CFIUS and broader U.S. government concerns, as is in part illustrated by recent White House contemplation of a larger U.S. government role in 5G networks and technology, and Obama-era reports regarding the importance of the semiconductor industry to national security.", "It has also been noted in the media that Qualcomm had a close and long-standing relationship with the U.S. government.", "As 2018 progresses, we will continue to further assess the impact of the president’s action as it relates to, or is reflected in reviews of, other transactions.", "The president’s blocking of the Broadcom/Qualcomm transaction should be seen as part of the Trump administration’s heightened effort to guard against perceived national security concerns emanating from trade.", "Consistent with the December 2017 National Security Strategy and as evidenced by the Order, we expect that CFIUS reviews will increasingly reflect the positions set forth in the president’s policy.", "Consequently, more than ever, cross-border transactions require careful and early-stage diligence and analysis to understand fully how CFIUS may view national security issues."]}

There is a lot of potential in online education, he says, “but almost two-thirds of the world does not have access to the Internet.", "Even worse, the poorest communities have the least access. The poorest countries have only 7.1% Internet penetration.", "So we asked ourselves, how can we bridge the gap between the abundance of fantastic learning resources online and the urgent need for better educational opportunities around the world?”", "FLE came up with the idea of packaging all of Khan Academy’s 7,000-plus educational videos and 1,600-plus interactive exercises on a huge array of topics into an offline platform they call KA-Lite.", "Alexandre pointed to a map of the world with locations (see map) where institutions in more than 150 countries have downloaded the open-source KA Lite software to engage with Khan Academy content locally.", "“This is a map of places where it has been installed, usually by the local community,” he said. “All the content can be loaded on a local server without needing upstream connectivity.”", "Classrooms were the initial target, but users now include community centers, prisons, refugee camps, after-school programs and other venues.", "But “we don’t want to stop there,” said Alexandre. “Our next step is a tool for empowering users to create and share their own lessons.”", "He announced during the press briefing that FLE has a platform in the works called Kolibri for the creation and sharing of open educational content to meet local cultural, linguistic and curricular needs of communities, then allowing content to be seamlessly passed along from person to person, device to device, for viewing on low-cost hardware, and shared back up to a central repository when Internet is available.", "Another startup, Sinopia Biosciences, is also tackling a huge problem. “Our main focus is on an inconvenient truth for pharmaceutical companies,” said alumnus Aarash Bordbar (BS ‘08, PhD ‘14), who co-founded the company with UC San Diego Bioengineering professor Bernhard Palsson.", "“Adverse drug reactions are an enormous health and financial burden and the numbers are staggering: 100,000 deaths per year in the U.S. related to drug side effects, 6.5% of hospital admissions, and 20 percent of phase 2 and 3 clinical trial failures are due to safety.”", "He pointed out that the entire pharmaceutical industry generates $600 billion per year, but it is estimated that society spends $140 billion annually on health care to fix problems caused by taking drugs.", "Hoping to help pharmaceutical companies analyze their data to avoid those adverse reactions, Sinopia Biosciences is developing tools for “biologically coherent data analysis” and tying it back to biochemical mechanisms.", "Some of these methods are based on work developed over the past 20 years in Palsson’s lab at UC San Diego.", "Bordbar noted that by being located in QI Innovation Space, the company will more easily be able to strike up collaborations with other groups, including clinicians, computational biologists and experimental biologists, to solve “complex problems which require an interdisciplinary approach.”", "RAM Photonics was originally founded in 2009 as a vehicle to find “highly innovative university research that is so high-tech that it would be hard for anyone else to commercialize it,” said co-founder John Marciante.", "The company has worked with UC San Diego faculty on developing photonic systems, and the university is in a unique position because the Qualcomm Institute boasts an industry-class Photonic Systems Laboratory with infrastructure that in earlier times might have only been at Bell Labs or similar industry facilities.", "RAM Photonics currently licenses technologies for medical, high-power machining and communications applications.", "“It’s very challenging because you’re trying to take a lab demo done in a multimillion-dollar lab and turn it into a product that the UPS guy can throw onto his truck and it’s expected to arrive at the other end and work right out of the box with the press of a button,” said Marciante, who thinks that having an office on campus will enhance collaboration with UCSD researchers.", "“We haven’t found anything like this [the Innovation Space] at other universities yet, but now we are talking with them about it!”", "Qualcomm Insitute research scientist Albert Yu-Min Lin’s first startup was Tomnod, a company he sold to Digital Globe in 2013, which has continued to invest in the crowdsourcing pioneer.", "(Lin noted that more than eight million people worldwide went onto Tomnod’s website over one weekend during the search for the lost Malaysian airliner, scouring through satellite imagery of areas where it may have gone down.)", "But Lin opted to remain on the staff of the Qualcomm Institute after the buyout, in part because he was already looking to other startups.", "One of those is now taking shape under the not-yet-permanent name, STEAM Engine.

After all, VirBELA has depended heavily on access to student game developers, MBA student users, and faculty guru Sheldon Brown, the designer of virtual worlds and director of the Arthur C. Clarke Center for Human Imagination, which is also located in Atkinson Hall.", "During the networking reception in the second-floor Innovation Space, UC San Diego Chancellor Pradeep K. Khosla echoed Vice Chancellor Brown’s earlier remarks.", "“This could not be more timely,” said Khosla. “The Qualcomm Institute Innovation Space is not only an agent for economic transformation, but also an agent of economic development in San Diego, bringing together outside entrepreneurs and inside students and faculty in a single, entrepreneurial ecosystem” with other units on campus.", "He also noted that hours earlier, he had approved a plan put forward by the Vice Chancellor for Research to set aside a few hundred-thousand dollars to be allocated as seed money for campus startups like those in the Innovation Space that might be able to benefit from access to small-scale investments on the level of five, ten or fifteen thousand dollars per infusion.", "Khosla also noted that the UC Office of the President is exploring the creation of incubator-type spaces on other campuses, at the same time as it expands investing in a UC Venture Fund which could conceivably also become a source of capital for companies in the new Qualcomm Institute Innovation Space.", "At least four more companies are now going through the process and have applications pending.

Since 1997 there have been at least 40 acquisitions on record, with details disclosed for 19 which themselves totaled US$8.4B. Notables would have to be the acquisition of Atheros in 2011 for US$3.1B and Cambridge Silicon Radio (CSR) in 2014 for US$2.5B.

And whether other companies develop their own SOI processes or license Peregrine’s, the benefits of silicon are immense.", "Silicon has two key, closely related advantages – one technical and one economic. The technical advantage is that silicon readily allows the addition of other functions into the RF silicon product.", "Historically, RF components were largely analog machines, they took a physical signal, and then handled it in some pre-determined way.", "Using silicon, it is much easier to embed a little bit of memory and a little bit of digital logic, giving the RF semi some ‘intelligence’.", "This opens up all kinds of doors, and most likely will lead to systems that allow the other components in the phone to ‘communicate’ or ‘control’ the RF semi.", "Someday, this will bring about tremendous gains in RF performance in the form of better reception and better battery life.", "The economic advantage is that using silicon means companies can take advantage of the huge silicon foundry industry.", "The shorthand way to describe this is to say that by using silicon, RF component vendors can take advantage of Moore’s Law and the steady improvement in chips that has brought about.", "The actual details of this are a bit more complicated, but the reality is no less powerful. RF component vendors using silicon will get a big boost in performance just by participating in the global silicon ecosystem.", "This has played out many times over history in other markets, and there is no reason to expect RF semis to be any different.", "When silicon can match the performance of some more exotic material, silicon quickly drives out the other material.", "In RF, we have not yet gotten to the point where commercial silicon PAs are available which can match that of the incumbent Gallium Arsenide (GaAs) Pas, but it is clear that GaAs’s days are numbered.", "All of this us brings us to what could be the biggest change to the RF market this decade. When more of the RF semis of the phone can be produced in silicon, they will get integrated into the other silicon components of the phone.", "But when we talk about ‘integration’, that really means one thing – the companies that make the key digital chips in the phone (aka basebands) will find a way to own the RF stack as well.", "This has already happened with another half dozen parts, and RF is one of the last left standing.", "Which brings us to Qualcomm. Two years ago, Qualcomm announced that they were entering the RF market.", "Qualcomm is by far the market share leader in advanced basebands. They have something like 95% share of the market for LTE (4G) basebands, and a very large share of 3G as well.", "If they can produce a working RF product, their control of other parts of the phone will give them an immense advantage in determining which RF products get built into devices.", "So Qualcomm’s entry, in theory, means the other RF components vendors face a bleak future.", "Then something strange happened. To date, Qualcomm has not yet shipped a working PA. They have a couple other RF parts, but they are missing the key elements.", "As I write this, I expect Qualcomm to make some big pre-MWC announcement about RF, but at this stage, they are far behind.", "Their RF product, which they call RF 360, is so far behind expectations that the Street no longer thinks Qualcomm can ever deliver.", "I think that view is misplaced. Qualcomm has the brains and the resources to eventually get RF 360 shipping, but its slow start has made the industry aware of the company’s vulnerabilities.", "Even when they can build a silicon PA, they are going to need filters. Filters are not semiconductors, they are essentially ceramic parts, that require the kind of manufacturing expertise that Qualcomm cannot build internally.", "So they are going to have to partner with someone to get filter capacity.", "Also, the small pieces of RF 360 which have shipped have gotten very poor reviews from the industry. This has made handset OEMs very nervous, as they are worried about having no choice but to use poorly-performing Qualcomm RF parts.", "Or worse, being forced to use some Qualcomm partner’s GaAs parts, delaying for years the potential benefits of silicon RF.", "Finally, when Qualcomm originally launched RF 360, investors hoped that this would open up a new market for the company, extending and protecting their core baseband market.", "Instead, RF 360 has had to rely on the baseband business to protect it and build its toehold. It is unclear how long it will take for this situation to be reversed.", "So if the whole history of the RF market is one of steady, cyclical moves towards consolidation. And we are now poised for a major technology transition to silicon which tilts the board heavily towards further integration.", "Does this mean the end is near for makers of RF components?", "First, I think there are more mergers in store. I am speaking solely from my view of the market, I certainly have no inside information that anything is pending.", "My guess is that we need a few more catalysts to really get things going. In practical terms, the next move is really Qualcomm’s.", "If we can leave Barcelona with tangible signs that RF 360 has made technical advances, and can expect a commercial product in the next year, then that will set the course for the rest of the industry as everyone scrambles to respond.", "On the other hand, if they announce that they are partnering with an incumbent vendor, then the industry can breathe a sigh of temporary relief.", "The last vendors will have time to develop their products and integrate their acquisitions fully.", "Regardless of where they stand with their silicon products, Qualcomm will still need to source filters and packaging from someone, and there are few choices left.", "Whoever that supplier is, it will get a big boost from an attachment to the leading baseband vendor. But it will the kind of partnership where both sides are always wary of the other.", "The filter vendor will have to face an eventual retreat from their PA business, as Qualcomm slowly gets that part working.", "And Qualcomm itself will have to watch as its filter partner supplies the other baseband vendors like Mediatek and Spreadtrum, who likely have their own RF ambitions.", "Set behind all of this are ongoing changes to the smartphone component market. The past few years have seen tremendous growth in RF content in phones.", "The transition to 4G has required much more complex, expensive RF components. For the next few years, the big growth in 4G devices will come at the bottom end of the price spectrum, as operators deploy 4G networks in markets that emphasize low-cost, simpler devices.", "This will mean a steady erosion in average prices for RF parts and a return to less heady times for the RF vendors.", "We saw this with 2G and 3G as well, the cycle will re-assert itself.", "The one exception to this may be Apple. The iPhone has been a huge driver of RF dollars in recent years.", "The latest devices have very complex RF circuitry, but this will likely peak at some point. Apple, and all the handset OEMs, want to see more integrated RF components, as it will save them money and space inside the phone.", "I have no idea if this will happen in this year’s iPhone or next year’s, but it will happen at some point.", "I recently wrote a note about the positives and minuses of being an Apple supplier. That note may never see the light of day, but suffice it to say, that Apple pushes all of its suppliers hard.", "If the past year or two have seemed like glory days for the RF industry… well, glory fades. There are still a lot of people competing for Apple sockets, and eventually that will take its toll on industry dynamics.", "In the past decade, we have gone from roughly 30 RF component vendors down to roughly a half dozen.

Qualcomm Inc., No. 17-CV-00220-LHK, slip op. (N.D. Cal. May 21, 2019). In a decision Qualcomm has vowed swiftly to appeal, Judge Koh found violations of Sections 1 and 2 of the Sherman Act (and, therefore, a violation of Section 5 of the FTC Act) and invalidated Qualcomm’s “No License, No Chip” business model, condemned discounts characterized as de facto exclusive dealing, and entered an injunction upending Qualcomm’s business model.", "Depending on how the appeal fares, the decision may have significant implications for licensing practices of holders of Standard Essential Patents (“SEPs”), including for 5G and the Internet of Things (“IoT”).", "Judge Koh focused on three interrelated aspects of Qualcomm’s conduct that the FTC asserted harmed competition in the markets for key modem chips used in cellular telephones.", "First, Qualcomm refused to make available to rivals exhaustive licenses to SEPs required to implement key standards on such chips.", "As a consequence, chip customers (cell phone makers, or original equipment manufacturers (“OEMs”) could only use the chips of Qualcomm’s competitors without infringing Qualcomm’s SEPs if the chip customers themselves licensed the SEPs from Qualcomm.", "Second, Qualcomm leveraged its monopoly position in chips to secure unreasonably high rates for its SEPs.", "Qualcomm, for example, refused to provide must-have chips unless customers took the unreasonable IP licenses—the “no license, no chip” model.", "Combined, these two practices had the effects, the Court reasoned, of raising rivals’ costs: chip rivals, unable to attain licenses from Qualcomm directly, were burdened with the high-cost licenses Qualcomm generated from OEMs.", "Saddling rivals with higher costs helped Qualcomm maintain its chip monopoly. Third, Qualcomm extended market share discounts to key customers that, the Court found, amounted to de facto exclusive dealing agreements, arrangements that also hindered Qualcomm’s chip rivals.", "Judge Koh’s Analysis of Qualcomm’s “No License, No Chips” Licensing Policy", "In analyzing the first two aspects of Qualcomm’s conduct, Judge Koh relied on detailed testimony from 16 OEMs (or groups of OEMs), including LG Electronics, Sony, Samsung, Huawei, Motorola, Lenovo, Blackberry, Apple, ZTE, Nokia, smaller Chinese OEMs, and others.", "The Court found that several common anticompetitive actions emerged:", "- First, Qualcomm refuses to sell an OEM modem chips exhaustively by requiring a separate patent license before selling modem chips, including cutting off OEMs’ chip supply to coerce OEMs to sign patent licenses on favorable terms to Qualcomm.", "Thus, the Court concluded that “Qualcomm wields its chip monopoly power to coerce OEMs to sign patent license agreements.”", "- Second, Qualcomm’s patent licenses include unusual provisions that require OEMs to cross-license their patents—often royalty-free—to Qualcomm’s modem chip division in exchange for rights to Qualcomm’s licensing division’s patents.", "- Third, Qualcomm has refused to provide samples of Qualcomm modem chips, withheld technical support, and delayed delivery of software or threatened to require the return of software until OEMs sign Qualcomm’s patent license agreements.", "- Fourth, Qualcomm refuses to provide OEMs lists of Qualcomm’s patents or patent claim charts during license negotiations.", "- Fifth, Qualcomm paid Samsung in 2018 in order “to silence Samsung.” Id.", "- Sixth, through Qualcomm’s practice of threats, Qualcomm has been able to generate and sustain unreasonably high royalty rates, including on handset sales that contain a rival’s modem chip.", "Qualcomm even imposed artificial and anticompetitive surcharges on the price of rivals’ modem chips. Id.", "Judge Koh’s legal analysis of the “no license, no chip” policy rested on three pillars. First, Judge Koh held that the antitrust laws imposed a duty on Qualcomm to license its SEPs to rivals, stressing that Qualcomm previously had a practice of extending such licenses but drew them back when Qualcomm determined it could make greater profits through coercing licenses from OEMs and at the same time hinder chip rivals.", "Id. at 128-30. Here, the Court also invoked its prior ruling finding that Qualcomm’s refusal to license violated commitments made to two cellular-standard-setting organizations (Telecommunications Industry Association (“TIA”) and Alliance for Telecommunications Industry Solutions (“ATIS”)).", "Second, Judge Koh reasoned that, set against the backdrop of this illegal refusal to deal, the cost-raising “no license, no chip” policy hindered rivals, leading to anticompetitive harm in modem chips.", "Here, Judge Koh, quoting the D.C. Circuit’s decision in United States v. Microsoft Corp., held it sufficient that Qualcomm engaged in “anticompetitive conduct that reasonably appear[s] capable of making significant contribution to . . .", "maintaining monopoly power.” Qualcomm, No. 17-CV-00220-LHK, slip op. at 42-43 (citations and internal quotation marks omitted).", "Nonetheless, and third, Judge Koh stated that she found actual anticompetitive effects:", "Qualcomm’s practice of refusing to license its cellular SEPs to rival modem suppliers . . . has promoted rivals’ exit from the market, prevented rivals’ entry, and delayed or hampered the entry and success of other rivals.", "Without a license to Qualcomm’s SEPs, a rival could not sell modem chips with any assurance that Qualcomm will not sue the rival and its customers for patent infringement.", "Qualcomm’s refusal to license its SEPs to rivals also enables Qualcomm to demand unreasonably high royalty rates.", "Id. at 114. Qualcomm further delayed licensing negotiations so that rivals’ chips were outdated by the time they entered the market.", "Judge Koh further condemned Qualcomm’s market share discounts as de facto exclusive dealing that caused further unlawful hindering of chip rivals.", "For example, the Court concluded that Qualcomm’s deals with Apple, including the 2011 Transition Agreement (“TA”) and the 2013 First Amendment to Transition Agreement (“FATA”), violated the Sherman Act since “Qualcomm shrunk rivals’ sales and foreclosed its rivals from the positive network effects of working with Apple.”", "Id. at 141. The Court “easily conclude[d]” that the TA and FATA were de facto exclusive deals because Qualcomm incentivized Apple to purchase substantial volumes of Qualcomm modem chips, and if Apple purchased any modem chips from a Qualcomm rival, the TA would automatically terminate and Apple would have to pay back hundreds of millions of dollars in incentives.", "Significantly, Judge Koh criticized Qualcomm for relying on incredible trial testimony at odds with its own contemporaneous documents.", "Qualcomm introduced only 16 of its own documents at trial, which was a fraction of the 125 Qualcomm documents that the FTC introduced.", "Upon consideration of the evidence and testimony, the Court found “Qualcomm’s internal, contemporaneous documents more persuasive than Qualcomm’s trial testimony prepared specifically for this antitrust litigation.”", "Id. at 12. The Court then reviewed various contradictions in the witnesses’ trial testimony, including statements made by Qualcomm’s President and its CEO during the trial in comparison to contemporaneous emails, handwritten notes, and recorded statements to the IRS.", "Judge Koh, citing evidence that Qualcomm intended to extend its practices to emerging 5G standards, granted injunctive relief to prevent, in her view, a substantial risk of ongoing anticompetitive behavior, including:", "- Qualcomm cannot use the “no license, no chips” policy, and Qualcomm must negotiate or renegotiate license terms with customers in good faith and without threats or discriminatory provisions.", "- Qualcomm must make exhaustive SEP licenses available to modem-chip suppliers on FRAND terms. Id. at 229.", "- Qualcomm may not enter express or de facto exclusive dealing arrangements for the supply of modem chips.", "- Qualcomm may not interfere with the ability of any customer to communicate with a government agency about a potential law enforcement or regulatory matter.", "Id. at 231-32. (Qualcomm at times had entered settlements precluding counterparties from assisting competition-law investigations or suits.)", "- Qualcomm must submit to compliance and monitoring procedures for seven years to the FTC. Id. at 232-33.", "Qualcomm has vowed to seek an expedited appeal of Judge Koh’s decision and to attempt to stay the injunction pending appeal.", "Judge Koh’s conclusion that Qualcomm violated an antitrust duty to deal (separate and apart from its FRAND commitments to standard-setting bodies) will surely be tested on appeal, as will her application of the Microsoft “nascent competitor” causation standard, among other rulings.", "The Department of Justice, which previously filed a Statement of Interest suggesting caution in formulating remedies, may also make its views known.", "In the meantime, FTC v. Qualcomm stands as an important landmark in the intellectual property/antitrust interface.", "It serves as a reminder to technology firms that licensing practices and asserted violations of FRAND commitments can, in certain circumstances, lead to allegations of anticompetitive harm in adjacent product markets—allegations that have the potential to entirely upend longstanding business models.", "Ropes & Gray attorneys provide timely analysis on legal developments, court decisions and changes in legislation and regulations.", "Stay in the loop with all things Ropes & Gray, and find out more about our people, culture, initiatives and everything that’s happening.", "We regularly notify our clients and contacts of significant legal developments, news, webinars and teleconferences that affect their industries."]}

And if so, which firms in the U.S. economy are most vulnerable to new antitrust liability?", "To answer those questions, we invited Jonathan Barnett of USC’s Gould School of Law, Stanford Law School’s Doug Melamed, and Fiona Scott Morton of Yale’s School of Management to a Bytes Chat.", "The Chat was moderated by Hal Singer, editor of Washington Bytes and Senior Fellow of the George Washington Institute of Public Policy.", "The transcript was edited lightly for readability, and each contributor had the opportunity to refine answers and add hyperlinks after the Chat.", "Dr. Scott Morton was Apple’s economic expert in the private litigation against Qualcomm. Mr. Melamed was senior vice president and general counsel of Intel from 2009 to 2014, and he advised Intel in the past regarding legal issues concerning some aspects of Qualcomm’s conduct.", "And Mr. Barnett has presented at events sponsored by Qualcomm, but otherwise has no connection to any party in this litigation or related litigation.", "Hal Singer: Doug, let’s talk about Qualcomm’s “no-license, no-chip policy” to set the stage. What is the traditional rubric under which antitrust assesses such conduct?", "It is tying? It is bundling? Exclusive dealing? Are these two separate products? What chapter of a future antitrust treatise would one find this case?", "Doug Melamed: It could be in a variety of sections—including tying, monopolization, or antitrust and IP—but I think the more important point is to understand the substance of the issue.", "Qualcomm has monopoly power in chips. It ties its chips to licenses for its SEPs when used in either its chips or competitors' chips.", "As with all such ties, the effect is to use some of its chip power to increase the price it can charge for the license.", "Unlike tying, though, to the extent only SEPs are involved, it does not divert demand from substitutes for the tied licenses.", "It might not increase the total price—chip plus license—for Qualcomm chips, but it directly increases the cost to the customer of competitors’ chips because it increases the price of the license.", "Singer: I realize that conduct can straddle many bins, and that life is messy, but it helps our readers to know generally where this conduct fits.", "Melamed: I understand, but analogies are usually imperfect. Qualcomm’s no license/no chips policy does not directly harm competition in any technology market.", "But the effect of the policy—increased price for licenses for rivals’ chips—harms competition in the chip market.", "The increased license price means either fewer chip sales by Qualcomm’s competitors or a reduced price of competitors’ chips to offset the artificial increase in the license price.", "In effect, Qualcomm imposes a tax on rivals and thereby reduces rivals’ incentives for innovation and entrenches Qualcomm’s monopoly.", "Although the factual impact takes some work to unpack, as a matter of law, it’s an easy case. It is an artificial contrivance that harms rivals to an existing monopoly.", "Fiona Scott Morton: The no license/no chip policy is the method by which Qualcomm extracts monopoly profit.", "Without the threat of withholding chips (which is the same as the threat of no revenue on those handsets, namely a large amount of money), Qualcomm could not force the payment of above-FRAND royalties.", "Without that leverage, original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) would ask a court to determine FRAND. So that’s the conduct’s primary purpose.", "However, the clever exclusionary feature of no license/no chip, which the court explains clearly, is that, at the same time, it puts a tax on rival chip makers because OEMs must pay the royalty even if they escape Qualcomm’s chip market power by buying from a rival.", "Additionally, Qualcomm often sets a higher royalty if an OEM buys from a rival.", "Singer: Jonathan, Fiona and Doug liken Qualcomm’s conduct to a tax on rival chip makers. Is tax the proper analytical lens?", "Jonathan Barnett: First, I think the use of the \"tax\" rhetoric is unhelpful to an objective antitrust analysis.", "As the 1995 IP Guidelines made clear, the royalty negotiated by the IP holder simply reflects the price the market is willing to pay for its good, as with any other goods or services market.", "Unless it is argued that Qualcomm’s SEPs are invalid or not infringed, then Qualcomm is entitled to extract a royalty with respect to all products and services to which the technology pertains.", "This is not an “artificial increase” in the license price: it is the fee negotiated for using the patented systems-level technology that is not embodied in the physical chipset.", "Second, I think it is important to go back to the structured framework courts have developed to analyze tying claims.", "Even if we grant the first two prongs of the traditional test (market power + separate products), I don't see how the evidence, plus the broader empirical literature, plausibly supports any harm to competition in the market more generally.", "To the contrary. This is a market in which adoption has been rapid, output has expanded, and prices adjusted for quality has declined.", "So that seems to preserve the presumption that tying in general is either innocuous or procompetitive.", "Scott Morton: Claiming that tech markets move fast, and therefore there is no harm, is a policy that completely insulates tech companies from antitrust liability because of secular price declines.", "There could be no LCD cartel by this reasoning, because the prices of those screens fell during the collusive period.", "This is contrary to fact—but follows from the logic above. How about PC prices falling while there was collusion in DRAM, LCD screens, and monopolization by the Microsoft OS?", "All that conduct is given a pass because prices were falling? And by the way, \"tax\" is not rhetoric. It is the technical term used by economists to describe a price addition on a product made by someone else.", "Melamed: The basic problem with what Jonathan is saying is that he overlooks that the royalty for the SEPs when used in rivals' chips is not a market royalty, but instead one artificially increased by use of Qualcomm’s market power in chips.", "Scott Morton: You have to be able to identify the but-for world to make any point like this and be taken seriously.", "What would technology have been like if Qualcomm had faced serious competition for the last 10 years?", "Melamed: There is another problem, too, which is that royalties determined after infringement, which is the case here, are never just market royalties.", "They are settlements of legal disputes in the shadow of litigation.", "Barnett: Outside explicit price fixing, almost any antitrust fact pattern gives rise to multiple interpretations, so sound public policy recommends that we select the most plausible interpretation given available evidence and taking into account the costs of false-positive versus false-negative errors.", "In general, modern courts have tended to start with a presumption of zero liability in the case of tying, given the wealth of procompetitive explanations and have been especially reluctant to undo ties in fast moving technology markets (see the Microsoft court's decision not to order the unbundling of Internet Explorer from the Microsoft operating system).", "Given the scope of the remedy in this case, which would essentially rewrite the entire licensing infrastructure in which the market has thrived for several decades and would therefore give rise to large social costs if the court got it wrong, I think the evidence of expanding output, falling price, and unimpeded innovation should give pause to fixing what doesn't seem to be broken.", "Scott Morton: As I said before, there is no such evidence unless you can specify a counterfactual. Additionally, this phrase \"then it is entitled to extract a royalty with respect to all products and services to which the technology pertains\" ignores the voluntary FRAND commitment Qualcomm made.", "That limits its royalty and thereby renders it unnecessary to use chip leverage because a court will happily enforce FRAND.", "I have never heard of the presumption you claim either.", "Melamed: What is the \"most plausible interpretation\" depends on the facts, and the 233-page opinion makes clear what the facts are here.", "Singer: Doug, quick legal question: If the conduct is styled as a tie-in, is there any legal requirement that plaintiff show competitive effects?", "Or are tie-ins treated differently? Jonathan seems to suggest that the effects element is missing here.", "Melamed: I think competitive effects do have to be shown. But foreclosure in the tied product market is not necessary, as we learned in Microsoft.", "Here, as in Microsoft, the harm is to competition in the tying product market—that is, the chip market.", "Singer: Changing subjects. Fiona, why intervene in markets where buyers and sellers have significant market power?", "Doesn’t economic theory predict that the offsetting buyer/seller power could result in competitive prices for the input here?", "Perhaps some of Qualcomm’s customers lack buying power, but certainly Apple must have significant buying power in the chip market.", "My family alone has 17 Apple devices! I can just hear the Chicago School crowd chanting “Let the magical market fairies resolve things!”", "Scott Morton: You hear this quite a bit in the healthcare context: “since the hospitals have merged and have bargaining power, we should let insurers merge.”", "This is nuts to me. Two wrongs do not make a right, as the saying goes. My view is that policy and enforcement should seek to keep all markets free of anticompetitive conduct.", "Moreover, many buyers of chips do not have the bargaining power of Apple, so your plan does not help them at all, whereas competition in chips would.", "Singer: I don't know if I have any plan beyond where I’m eating tonight, but my question (restated) is: Why can't Apple's countervailing buying power be counted on to push input prices back down to competitive levels?", "Perhaps Qualcomm's selling power is special here, given the patent? Or the conduct?", "Scott Morton: That's what the 233 pages of facts describe, why it was that no buyer was strong enough to defeat the anticompetitive scheme.", "However, as I said already, supposing one buyer could defeat it, but all the others paid higher prices, why would we think that is a victory compared to enforcing so the entire market is competitive?", "Singer: That's a great point, and why I think the smaller OEMs make for a better fact pattern. I was thinking about Apple's claim against Qualcomm in particular.", "Melamed: Most phone makers do not have market power, and even buyers with market power are not guardians of the public interest.", "They can be given a share of monopoly rents to, for example, agree to anticompetitive exclusive dealing, as was the case here", "Barnett: I think it is important to appreciate the bargaining power on each side in the SEP smartphone market.", "Currently Apple captures approximately 40% of the retail price on the iPhone while most estimates give all IP licensors collectively about 5%.", "So that should give some caution in adopting the view that an individual SEP licensor is ever in a position to dictate terms to a licensee.", "Additionally, keep in mind that, by the time licensing negotiations commence, the upstream R&D firm has already sunk billions into technology that it has yet to monetize and may not even have achieved adoption in the market.", "The same is not true of the licensees that have not borne comparable costs and risks at that stage. I think that the rebates and incentive payments that the opinion documents being offered at least to large licensees reflects this bargaining dynamic, which is far from one sided.", "It is also consistent with the trade literature that notes that large licensees are often able to substantially reduce \"nominal\" royalty rates through cross licensing and other terms.", "Scott Morton: Every product is different, so comparing the cost of IP to the gross margin of the finished good and expecting that to be some constant across products does not make sense.", "There are a wide variety of business models. Second, in the US, we don't pay innovators before they have invented something that a buyer decides is useful.", "That's why innovation is risky! To say to Qualcomm, “Sure we'll promise to license and use everything you invent for 5% of the handset without knowing whether or not it's any good” is an odd social contract and not one that provides good incentives for useful innovation.", "Melamed: Even if we assume, counterfactually, a bilateral monopoly, the equilibrium price would in all likelihood still be supra-competitive, and the no license/no chip policy enables Qualcomm to allocate some of its market power in chips to the license by increasing the nominal price of the license.", "It is that price increase that imposes a cost burden on rival chip makers.", "Singer: Jonathan, you argue in a recent op-ed that Judge Koh’s decision, if upheld, would “endanger a patent-based licensing model that has supported innovation across several generations of wireless communications technology.”", "You go on to explain that the ruling would disadvantage firms that operate under licensing-based business models “in which R&D is monetized externally and disseminated broadly,” and would favor “integrated business models in which R&D is monetized internally and not disseminated at all.”", "Jonathan, which U.S. firms besides Qualcomm operate under a patent-based licensing model? How important are these firms that “monetize R&D externally” to the U.S. economy?", "And wouldn’t a detractor say that the decision would only expose such firms if they also (1) had monopoly power and (2) were found to have violated the antitrust laws?", "Barnett: At the risk of unintentional omission, I think it is widely acknowledged that there are four firms in the current market that have made the key technological contributions to the 3G and 4G wireless markets—ARM, Qualcomm, Nokia and Ericsson.", "Going back to 2G/GSM, we would add Motorola. These upstream firms rely to varying extents on being able to license IP to downstream users (equipment makers and telecom carriers) and, in the case of nonpayment, to enforce those licenses and patents in court.", "ARM (which licenses to chip design firms) and Qualcomm (which licenses to OEMs) adopt the “purest” forms of this model because they are not integrated (ARM), or are not integrated substantially (Qualcomm), into downstream production, assembly and distribution.", "What I intended to suggest in the language you quoted is that, in a world in which licensing relationships are easily subject to legal challenge (how will an IP licensor ever know what a court will deem to be a “fair and reasonable” royalty rate?) and IP owners generally cannot secure an injunction (under the case law that has developed in the past decade or so), the viability of this model for privately funding R&D is placed at risk.", "That doesn’t mean innovation would come to a halt. It means that firms will be compelled to monetize R&D by embedding that technology in hardware, software or other goods that are not as exposed to expropriation.", "That’s Intel’s strategy with the microprocessor, which is not licensed to anyone, as well as Apple’s strategy with iOS, which is again not licensed to anyone.", "Effectively forcing all firms to adopt an Intel-like strategy on chips and an Apple-like strategy on the operating system is a potential efficiency loss because it raises entry costs (since firms must innovate plus embed the innovation in a “tangible” product) and potentially limits OEMs’ access to technology inputs since firms that integrate downstream into the device markets are likely to have little incentive to license out their innovations.", "Scott Morton: They are discussing Qualcomm at the OECD right now too!", "Singer: Fiona, I need you to close your other browser and focus on the Chat.", "Scott Morton: I am confused as to why Qualcomm would be worse off—under its own theory of the case—if it went to a court and asked the court to determine FRAND and put a fair value on its technology.", "The company has said repeatedly it has great technology, so it should not be afraid of that scrutiny.", "FRAND policies are voluntary, and SSO members know that disputes will be resolved by courts—and they could have picked a different scheme if they thought courts were bad at determining FRAND.", "Likewise, if Qualcomm’s chips are better due to its own research skill, Qualcomm may have market power achieved on the merits and can charge a premium for those chips.", "I am not seeing how the business model is harmed by being unable to leverage chip supply to force a higher royalty—unless the royalty was not justified by the technology and was above a competitive rate to begin with.", "Moreover, since we don't do much manufacturing in the US anymore, everything is imported, and therefore subject to possible ITC exclusion orders.", "That seems like a very powerful threat for IP holders, indeed, one that Qualcomm tried using against Apple (twice).", "Melamed: Once again, I prefer to focus on facts. First, this case was based on no license/no chip, which is about misuse of market power in chips.", "It is not an attack on non-practicing entity business models. Nor does it mean that \"licensing relationships are easily subject to legal challenge.\"", "Qualcomm has monopoly power in chips, and its unlawful conduct was specific to its circumstances.", "Barnett: As a practical matter, in a world in which (1) SEP owners have no credible injunction threats against infringers, (2) infringers generally have sufficient resources to litigate indefinitely, and (3) courts have no added-value expertise in evaluating the appropriate royalty rate, Qualcomm would have a substantially reduced expectation in being able to enforce negotiated licenses even if those were set at \"appropriate\" rates since they would inevitably be challenged in court.", "The SEP infringement litigation makes clear that courts have no adequate methodology by which to evaluate royalty rates absent a competitive benchmark.", "In that world, an R&D intensive firm would adapt by moving away from licensing and extracting value through the direct sale of products and services.", "That limits access to technology inputs for downstream firms without comparable R&D capacities.", "Melamed: There are fundamental problems with the trope about harming welfare by reducing the monopolist’s incentives.", "It is wrong, or at least very overstated, as a factual matter for a number of reasons. Perhaps more important, it focuses just on the monopolist and overlooks the ultimate issue, which is innovation in the market as a whole.", "When monopolists use their power to impede rivals, they reduce incentives for innovation by actual and potential rivals and by the market as a whole.", "Scott Morton: Qualcomm could always suggest the establishment of a specialized arbitrator that was quick and inexpensive for FRAND disputes.", "An SSO could adopt such a method for dispute resolution if Qualcomm thinks courts are so terrible at determining FRAND.", "Carl Shapiro and I have a paper, and a little model, demonstrating Doug’s point above.", "Melamed: I have not seen a lot of endless litigation by implementers. And if Qualcomm wanted to prevent that, it could license the whole market by licensing a handful of chip makers, instead of choosing to license downstream for the purpose, as found by Judge Koh, of gaining more licensing revenues.", "Barnett: The specialized arbitration mechanism is a theoretical possibility and could be a constructive solution but, again, the SEP infringement litigation to date shows that courts look for comparable licenses to determine royalty rates.", "Once any negotiated license can be challenged in court, and again without the ability to block infringers through injunction, the bargaining leverage shifts to downstream producers and the licensing market is distorted and no longer provides an accurate benchmark by which an arbitrator or court can determine patent value through comparable licenses.", "The bargaining dynamic I described above, in which the IP provider has already sunk costs into R&D and sometimes has yet to monetize it, exacerbates this situation further.", "Singer: Judge Koh’s opinion invokes Aspen Skiing, which established the conditions under which a firm must deal with its rivals.", "Although its reach has been marginalized by subsequent decisions such as Trinko, Aspen’s duty to deal turned on evidence of defendant’s terminating a “voluntary and profitable course of dealing” with its rivals and doing so without “valid business reasons”.", "As a basis of liability, Judge Koh’s opinion finds a course-of-dealing shift by Qualcomm, which previously licensed its SEP to modem chip suppliers, citing Qualcomm exchanges with the IRS from 2012 (page 127) and internal emails in 1999 (page 137).", "Will this opinion breathe new life into Aspen? If so, are there any firms in the economy that are particularly vulnerable to stronger enforcement of refusals to deal with rivals?", "Could this decision, for example, force Facebook to interoperate with a social media upstart?", "Barnett: Personally, I found this to be the weakest part of the opinion because it essentially misapplies Supreme Court precedent.", "Aspen Skiing has been drastically narrowed in subsequent Supreme Court rulings (the Court placed it “at the outer boundary” of antitrust law in Trinko), which suggests that it should be confined to its facts.", "The facts as determined by the district court do not fit into that narrow window. According to those findings, Qualcomm apparently licensed certain chip manufacturers about 20 years ago and then moved to device-level licensing.", "That hardly fits the facts of Aspen Skiing, in which two ski operators were profitably engaged in an uninterrupted joint venture over the course of more than a decade.", "Additionally, Aspen Skiing requires that the defendant terminate the cooperative relationship without “valid business reasons.”", "The court’s opinion identifies that business reason: it was more “lucrative” for Qualcomm to do so. It’s hard to imagine a more legitimate business justification (unless we adopt discredited Alcoa-type reasoning that a monopolist monopolizes simply by expanding output to meet market demand).", "This too distinguishes the facts from Aspen Skiing, in which the court imposed a duty to deal in part because the defendant essentially threw money away by refusing cash-equivalent ticket vouchers that were presented by the terminated operator’s customers.", "Melamed: Aspen was expressly not overruled by Trinko, so it does not need new life. The key point is that the refusal to license at the chip level, where Qualcomm could not use its market power to coerce artificially increased license royalties, pushed all licensing down to the device level, and thus acted in aid of Qualcomm’s unlawful no license/no chips policy.", "This case did not involve a standalone refusal to deal, such as that at issue in Trinko.", "Scott Morton: Jonathan, there is no FRAND commitment in your example. This case is stronger than Aspen for that reason.", "Furthermore, when “lucrative” reflects monopoly profit acquired through the illegal conduct, it is not a “valid business reason.”", "Barnett: The FRAND commitment does add a new factor. However, courts have generally deemed it a contractual agreement (under third-party beneficiary doctrine).", "For purposes of appeal, I understand that the Judge's opinion relied on Aspen in order to impose a duty to deal independent of any contractual obligation.", "That is in part why the implications of the decision on this point are broader than might otherwise have been the case.", "Melamed: I agree that Judge Koh’s reliance on the earlier sales was weak, but I think the criticism conflates principle and evidence.", "The principle is that a refusal to deal that entails a profit sacrifice—that is, that departs from the most valuable use of the asset—is anticompetitive conduct (see my article in Berkeley Tech Law Journal).", "It therefore is, or at least should be, illegal if it harms competition, as it did here. The problem, of course, is proving a profit sacrifice.", "Prior dealing is often-needed evidence of that sacrifice and of the required terms of trade. But that evidence was not needed here because Qualcomm agreed to license on FRAND terms and thus demonstrated that such licensing, in exchange for inclusion of its patents in the standard, was profitable.", "Scott Morton: Then there are two reasons Qualcomm must license! Both good.", "Singer: In a fiery Wall Street Journal op-ed, FTC Commissioner Christine Wilson came out against her agency’s victory in the matter.", "She wrote the judge “radically expanded a company’s legal obligation to help its competitors by reviving and extending a discredited Supreme Court case called Aspen Skiing v. Aspen Highlands Skiing (1985).”", "She also claimed that the decision “contains no territorial limitations,” and thus affects contracts between Qualcomm and foreign buyers for products “sold to consumers living abroad.”", "We’ve talked about Aspen already. Let’s focus on her second critique concerning geographical reach. Doug, is this a fair critique of the decision?", "Melamed: No. Qualcomm sells chips in a global market to U.S. and foreign manufacturers. Harm to competition in that market, wherever the conduct takes place, harms the US.", "Under those circumstances, a global remedy is needed to protect the United States, and such a remedy is entirely consistent with both well-established principles of international law and the Foreign Trade Antitrust Improvements Act of 1982, 15 U.S.C. § 6a, which governs extraterritorial application of US antitrust law.", "By the way, I think Commissioner Wilson’s op-ed was very inappropriate. She is one of 5 FTC Commissioners, all appointed by President Trump.", "As I see it, an FTC Commissioner can work with her colleagues to determine or change FTC conduct, and she can dissent from decisions with which she disagrees.", "But having failed at that, she should not write an op-ed criticizing the agency and the court that agreed with it and asking a court of appeals to reverse it.", "Imagine a district court judge writing such an op-ed about an opinion of another judge on the same court or an Associate AG asking a court to block a DOJ policy.", "General principles of respect for process, institutions, and colleagues and predecessors should preclude such conduct.", "Scott Morton: Many markets are now global and we have devised no system for determining which agency will be in charge of cases with a global dimension.", "If Qualcomm wants to have a global contract for chips with Samsung, then it will have to comply with all the relevant antitrust laws and rulings in all the relevant jurisdictions.", "It seems possible for Qualcomm to create US-only contracts if it feels that’s worthwhile. Of course, if a US court determines that FRAND is $0.10 for Qualcomm’s patents, then it is not clear why an OEM selling in Russia or Brazil would be willing to pay $10.", "At some level, the increased transparency the decision requires may really be the problem for Qualcomm, not global contracts.", "Barnett: I also don't see any legal issue on this point. I think Commissioner Wilson was perhaps just pointing out the far-reaching effects of the decision.", "Singer: In the same op-ed, Commissioner Wilson also argues that unless the decision is overturned, “it invites the plaintiffs’ bar to file private antitrust suits against companies that decline to share their secret sauce—whether it’s a patent, an algorithm or an actual sauce recipe—with competitors.", "Faced with this potential onslaught, a company understandably might question the value of investing in new assets and technologies.”", "Is this a credible argument? What are the likely plaintiff follow-on cases, if any, made possible by this ruling?", "And wouldn’t private plaintiffs seeking damages have to show a causal connection between the conduct and competitive effects, which apparently wasn’t done in this litigation?", "Scott Morton: I don’t understand how selling a chip is giving away a “secret sauce.” Qualcomm has sold chips for a long time and that is one way it makes money.", "Patents are public. Standards are public. Companies disclose their declared SEPs when licensing. FRAND rates are exactly chosen by a court to ensure fair payment to innovators and therefore preserve the incentive to innovate.", "Barnett: On that point, Commissioner Wilson may have overdrawn the implications of the decision. But there is a possibility that such a broad application of Aspen Skiing, based on dated evidence of a past cooperative relationship with some firms (which the order then essentially extrapolates to a duty to deal to all similarly situated firms), could expose a large pool of firms to less than entirely robust “duty to deal” claims.", "This too could discourage firms from pursuing licensing-based monetization models since, once a firm had entered into a relationship with a particular licensee, it may be exposed to legal liability if it ever sought to terminate that relationship (or, by the logic of the court’s opinion, declined to enter into a relationship with any similarly situated firm).", "As Hal suggests, though, it would be expected that this risk would be tempered to the extent that a plaintiff would be required to show that any unilateral refusal to deal had an anticompetitive effect, as is typically the case in a rule of reason analysis.", "Melamed: Commissioner Wilson seems to have in mind a demand by one firm for a license to a rival's trade secret (think Coke formula) or to patents that the firm does not what to license widely at any price.", "But this case involves a firm whose core business is to license its patents to the entire industry. Moreover, the core of the case is the no license/no chips policy, not a standalone refusal to deal by a firm that has no interest in licensing its patents.", "This case should not invite an “onslaught” of demands, and it will certainly not require future courts to relax the rules in very different circumstances.", "Singer: Fiona, quick economic detour: Was it not possible to show a causal connection here between the challenged conduct and competitive effects?", "For example, couldn't one show that Apple (or any other OEM) passed through a portion of the inflated royalty rate to consumers in the form of higher phone prices, and because the demand for phones is downward-sloping, we get output effects?", "Scott Morton: Showing passthrough is econometrically hard work and technical. Here, the \"CDMA adder\" was the overcharge that Qualcomm explicitly adopted where it had market power and not where it didn't.", "Per the opinion at 26: “Qualcomm planned to charge what the strategic plan called a ‘CDMA Adder’ of $4 on CDMA modem chips relative to comparable modem chips without CDMA capability.”", "That was paid by the direct purchaser, which is the one antitrust laws protect. So I don't think any evidence on price effects is missing from the case.", "Singer: Part of what Qualcomm did that was deemed anticompetitive, in addition to threatening Samsung’s chip supply and conditioning its terms (including a rebate on the royalty) on Samsung’s purchasing at least 85 percent of its chipsets from Qualcomm, was “paying to extinguish Samsung’s antitrust claims and to silence Samsung.”", "The discussion begins at page 60 of the opinion. It cites to a 2018 Settlement Agreement in which Samsung agrees to release claims based on, among other things, “findings or conclusions articulated in . . .", "(4) the ultimate decisions, settlement agreements or other dispositions of any of the cases brought against Qualcomm (or that contain counterclaims against Qualcomm) by the U.S. Federal Trade Commission . . .”", "Judge Koh seems to be saying a monopolist cannot silence counterparties from interacting with antitrust enforcers.", "Is this a novel finding, or has a settlement with a customer that waives future antitrust claims been recognized as being anticompetitive before?", "In any event, is this good policy? Patent settlements that involve reverse payments in excess of certain benchmarks are deemed potentially anticompetitive, and the FTC’s Administrative Law Judge just found that 1-800’s trademark settlements with online lens suppliers were anticompetitive.", "But I wasn’t aware of settlements to release antitrust claims could also be anticompetitive.", "Scott Morton: To me this goes to the anticompetitive intent. Why would a party need to block a licensee from speaking to the antitrust authority if that party had not violated any antitrust laws?", "Consider the similarity with pay for delay. In pay for delay the brand pays the generic not to let the court determine the patent is invalid, and in that way preserves monopoly power for longer, harming consumers.", "In the case of Qualcomm, it pays an OEM to not let an agency determine the contracts are anticompetitive, and in that way preserves market power for longer, harming consumers.", "Singer: Wow, wasn't expecting an answer from the token econ on the panel, but that was good!", "Barnett: I take Fiona's point, but the language of the order seems to imply that any settlement by Qualcomm (or, by implication, any other IP licensor) entered into to resolve a dispute with an actual or prospective licensee would never be deemed free from legal challenge.", "Without the types of qualifying factors that courts have introduced in the “pay-for-delay” cases to address those types of offsetting concerns, this would seem to discourage parties from ever settling litigation.", "Without further modification, that rule cannot be sound policy.", "Melamed: Settlements can be anticompetitive if they contain provisions requiring anticompetitive conduct, which is often the case with reverse payments settlements.", "More generally, private claims can be settled by sharing monopoly rents and leave the illegal conduct of the defendant unchanged.", "Therefore, Judge Koh is right not to just assume settlements are in the public interest. I understand the settlement agreement to require that Samsung will drop its claims against Qualcomm, including efforts to intervene in other proceedings, and its efforts affirmatively to persuade governments to bring cases against Qualcomm, but Samsung remains free to respond to government and other discovery requests.", "As long as the settlement does not interfere with proceedings properly brought by others, it seems ok.", "But it would be problematic if it prevented Samsung from bringing complaints about future conduct to the attention of government enforcers.", "Singer: Fiona, as a testifying expert, I like to think (perhaps narcissistically) that economists are really really important in antitrust matters.", "Despite my understanding of his prominent role at trial, I can’t find the FTC’s economic expert directly cited in the opinion.", "Qualcomm’s economic experts also received little attention (and not the good kind). Instead, the court held that anticompetitive effects could be reasonably inferred from the conduct and liability turned largely on contemporaneous record evidence.", "Given that so much of what testifying experts do in antitrust litigation is connect the conduct empirically to competitive effects, did economists play an important role in the case?", "Where would I find their influence in the opinion? And if more courts go this route, will it permanently dampen the demand—shudder at the thought—for testifying economic experts?", "Scott Morton: I disagree entirely with your premise. The three Qualcomm economists, Tasneem Chipty, Aviv Nevo, and my own Dean at Yale, Ted Snyder, were all found unreliable by the judge.", "Carl Shapiro was not mentioned by name; instead the court adopted his economic opinions throughout the decision.", "The court cites Professor Greg Mankiw’s economics textbook for an explanation of the tax on rivals; the court carries out a hypothetical monopolist test to determine Qualcomm has market power.", "These are economic concepts that the judge learned from the FTC economist. It is very difficult, in my view, to get to the right answer in an antitrust case without good economics.", "Singer: Disagreeing with the premise, eh? Perhaps you've been deposed a few times?", "Scott Morton: And for a witness, having the court simply adopt your words, rather than quoting you, is fantastic.", "A total win. The strength of the government's witness shows up in the narrative connecting the 233 pages of facts.", "Singer: I need pinpoints, Fiona! See generally’s are frowned upon in this shop.", "Melamed: Judge Koh understood the arguments made by the FTC's economists. Their job was to help her understand the facts.", "It appears that they succeeded. It is possible she would have come to the same conclusion without the economists, but that is speculation.", "She needed to explain why she disagreed with Qualcomm’s economists. She had no comparable need to comment specifically on the FTC's economists.", "Singer: Jonathan? Did this decision need more cowbell aka MOAR econs?", "Barnett: I agree that economists are vital to sound antitrust analysis and adjudication. But I don't feel that the court in this case gave due consideration to the economic analysis on either side, which does not give a great deal of confidence in the substantive outcome.", "It's surprising that the court did not assess the strength of the government’s key expert witness and, in a single sentence I believe, essentially dismissed the testimony of the defendant’s key expert witness.", "Yet the opinion has no trouble relying on and describes at length the obviously conflicted testimony of producer/licensees, such as Samsung, Huawei and others, who unsurprisingly allege that Qualcomm’s royalties are “too high.”", "The district court’s failure to engage with the economic testimony in this case compares unfavorably with the district court’s thorough examination of the economic testimony in US v. ATT et al (Time Warner merger), independent of whether or not the substantive outcome in that case was correct.", "Melamed: I am tempted to ask Jonathan what he thinks of the Supreme Court majority's attention to the facts in Amex.", "Singer: Hold up, I’ve got my realtor on the line. Are you folks saying testifying experts need not liquidate their second homes in light of this decision?", "Melamed: If it's a beach house, you have other reasons to sell.", "Singer: My wife wants me to get rid of it in any event. Moving on. Judge Koh held that plaintiffs did not need to causally connect Qualcomm’s licensing practices with competitive effects with direct evidence, because Microsoft, holds that a court can infer causation from conduct generally (at 205): “Where the government is a plaintiff, the Court may “infer ‘causation’ from the fact that a defendant has engaged in anticompetitive conduct that ‘reasonably appear[s] capable of making a significant contribution to . . .", "maintaining monopoly power.” Microsoft, 253 F.3d at 79 (citation omitted).” As Jonathan points out in his op-ed, however, the D.C. Circuit also stated in Microsoft that, “when using such an ‘edentulous’ standard for finding liability, it would be inappropriate to order the most extensive equitable remedies ‘[a]bsent some measure of confidence that there has been an actual loss to competition.’”", "First, I had to look up “edentulous,” which means lacking teeth. Second, does this mean that Judge Koh’s decision on remedies is in tension with Microsoft?", "Scott Morton: I don’t really understand why we think the opinion does not connect licensing practices with competitive effects.", "The “CDMA adder” is a considerable price premium; Qualcomm has market power in chips so it is able to impose the adder; the documentary evidence explained how Qualcomm obtained market power in chips with its exclusive contracts, loyalty rebates, and no license/no chip; Qualcomm’s documents further show that these policies were designed to keep entrants out and extract profit.", "Barnett: I find this to be an especially troubling part of the opinion. Typically, Section 2 findings of liability rest on objective evidence of effect (most obviously, price), which may then be supplemented by evidence of intent.", "Consider the Apple e-books case: there was evidence of intent but there was powerful evidence of a price effect in the e-book bestseller market.", "In this case, there is no objective evidence of effect, so the court relies almost entirely on subjective evidence of intent.", "But subjective evidence is often unreliable since businesspersons often use language that is not necessarily indicative of anticompetitive intent in the antitrust sense.", "I don’t think this intent-based approach is consistent with Section 2 jurisprudence generally (compare the demanding probative threshold set by the Supreme Court in the recent Amex decision), and could lead to lots of false positives if this approach were widely adopted.", "Singer: Not to mention the reduction in the demand for econs!", "Melamed: The theory of this case, like Microsoft, was that the anticompetitive conduct entrenched Qualcomm’s chip monopoly.", "As in Microsoft, directional or probabilistic harm is enough and there is no need to prove a but-for world and compare it to the actual world.", "Remedies serve a variety of purposes. The divestiture remedy in Microsoft was intended to restore competition, and the court held it was excessive given weak proof of actual harm.", "The remedies ordered by Judge Koh are for the different purposes of terminating the unlawful conduct and preventing its recurrence.", "The concerns of the Microsoft court are not applicable.", "Barnett: I think the reasons that led the DC appeals court in Microsoft to reject divestiture pertain here.", "While the order is not strictly speaking structural, the effects are -- it would require a renegotiation of potentially every OEM license and the negotiation of new licenses with chip makers.", "For a remedy of that scope, the language in the Microsoft case suggests that an especially strong showing of harm is required.", "Singer: Relatedly, Judge Koh appears to get to competitive effects indirectly via a high foreclosure share, by applying the factors from ZF Meritor.", "In particular, Qualcomm’s exclusive arrangement were found to have “shrunk rivals’ sales and foreclosed its rivals from the positive network effects of working with Apple, which the Court discusses below.", "In so doing, Qualcomm maintained the monopoly power in the CDMA and premium LTE modem chip markets that Qualcomm has used to sustain QTL’s unreasonably high royalty rates.”", "(at 141) Under what conditions can a plaintiff establish anticompetitive effects without direct evidence linking the conduct to higher prices or lower output or reduced quality?", "Is the “effects-free” path limited to exclusive dealing arrangements, or could foreclosure achieved via (say) self-dealing or self-preferencing also be subject to this standard?", "(This is a good time to plug Fiona and Doug’s new piece on the challenges in applying antitrust to digital platforms, which notes the difficulty in observing competitive effects when they manifest as innovation harms.)", "And is this path only available to agencies or private parties seeking injunctive relief?", "Melamed: This is not \"effects free\" liability. The court used traditional analysis to infer harm to rivals from substantial foreclosure share (as did the court in Microsoft) and, at least in the Apple agreement, found harm to competition.", "Singer: I certainly didn’t mean “econ free” liability. I simply intend to convey that there is no direct evidence—for example, an econometric model linking the conduct causally with an output or price effect.", "Scott Morton: Once again, a simple economic model and Qualcomm’s documents show directly that its practices were designed to create market power, and did so.", "The evidence is so plain that the FTC did not need an “econometric model.” Sometimes lawyers get confused that the strength of economic evidence is related to the number of equations or Greek letters used, but this is not how its measured!", "Barnett: I think this is one of the few potentially reasonable parts of the opinion because the court uses the existing analytical framework in the case law for analyzing an exclusive dealing arrangement based on actual or potential foreclosure effects.", "Nonetheless I’m not sure the court shows the coercion element that is typically required to find an exclusive dealing arrangement unlawful.", "Apple obviously exercised considerable bargaining power given its dominant position in the branded retail market, which appears to be reflected by the fact that it was Qualcomm that paid Apple for exclusivity, both through the incentive payments and rebates.", "Melamed: The incentive payments are a way of sharing monopoly rents. That is enough for liability. There was no marketwide output effect proven as to the past, but again this is a monopoly maintenance case not a monopoly creation case.", "Singer: The opinion found offense in Qualcomm’s royalties being set as a percentage of the value of the end-product, in this case, cellphones.", "Judge Koh ruled that such a formula was inconsistent with federal patent law, and that Qualcomm’s royalty rates should be based instead on the value of specific patented parts.", "But how can the value of input be fully de-linked to the value of the output in which the input is used.", "Marshall’s laws of derived demand tell us how the elasticity of demand for an input is connected to the elasticity of demand for the final good.", "Does anyone have ideas as to how Qualcomm could achieve this de-linking?", "Barnett: I don't think it’s feasible, which is shown by the fact that the wireless market does not follow this practice and courts have failed when attempting to artificially engineer component level licensing in infringement litigation.", "Device-level licensing is virtually universal among IP licensors in the smartphone/wireless market. Absent a conspiracy among the 20 IP licensors who account for approximately 80% of all SEPs in the 4G market, that strongly suggests that it is efficient.", "There are several rationales for device-level licensing: (1) it is more efficient to extract value at a single point on the supply chain, (2) it is more efficient to do so at the point of sale, at which point customer demand (and therefore market valuation) is revealed, (3) it shifts to the supplier part of the risk of market failure, which actually benefits producers, and (4) it minimizes the risk of double marginalization (royalty stacking).", "Not coincidentally, reasons (1)-(3) explain why a star actor’s variable compensation on a movie is computed based on a percentage of the box office, so the logic probably applies quite generally across IP markets.", "Barnett: That was Hollywood jargon. Lived too long in LA.", "Scott Morton: This is a place where economists part company with most others. The competitive price for Qualcomm’s SEPs at any moment in time is a number, a dollar number.", "Because I am a skilled arithmetician ( ;-) ) I can generate that same number by expressing it as a percentage of a chip or a percentage of a phone–all I have to do is vary the percentage.", "For example, if a court determines that the correct royalty is $.50, that could be 2.5% of a $20 chip or it could be 0.1% of a $500 handset.", "There is no reason the percentage rate needs to stay the same when moving between the handset and the chip.", "Useful technology should be paid what it is worth in order to generate incentives for innovation. Imagine I had invented a fantastic new corkscrew design and I licensed it for $20 a unit.", "The fact that that the entire production cost of the corkscrew is $1 does not prevent my idea from being worth $20 and the percentage royalty being 2000%.", "Melamed: The theory about derived demand would suggest that it makes no difference, but there is abundant evidence that it matters a great deal.", "In essence, by \"anchoring\" the fact-finder in the much, much greater value of the phone (compared to the chip component), the patent holder can manipulate the fact-finder to determine an inflated value for the patent.", "That is why patent law has moved toward using the smallest saleable unit (here, the chip) as the base on which to determine the royalty.", "Barnett: Patent law has generally only mandated use of the smallest saleable unit (in multi-component products) as the royalty base in jury trials where there are concerns that jury members will not appreciate that a small royalty on an entire product royalty base is economically equivalent to a larger royalty on a component-level royalty base.", "Those sophistication concerns do not generally apply outside that context (as in a business negotiation).", "Accordingly, the Federal Circuit has specifically rejected any substantive rule that courts in general must determine reasonable royalties based on the smallest saleable component.", "Singer: Fiona, in proving liability, economists typically show a change in pricing that can be linked to a change in market power or foreclosure.", "It appears that Qualcomm has charged the same royalty rate (approximately five percent of the value of the phones, but subject to royalty caps and rebates) since its inception, which renders such proof impossible.", "Here Qualcomm’s percentage rate was deemed excessive, not because Qualcomm charged a higher fee with more market power or foreclosure, but instead because Qualcomm’s contribution to phone value allegedly declined relative to other inputs in the phone (e.g., the operating system, software, applications, and design).", "What do we make of Qualcomm’s constant royalty share? Is Qualcomm’s constant royalty rate consistent with the exercise of monopoly?", "Scott Morton: Yes. If one thought that FRAND was being followed and therefore the royalty reflected the value of the SEPs, and over time Qualcomm’s share of SEPs declines, its most critical patents expire, and the handset includes a lot of valuable technology unrelated to the communication capability, you would expect the royalty rate to be declining over time.", "Even if Qualcomm purchases more LTE patents in one year for example, then after the purchase, the competitive royalty rate would rise.", "Instead, we see a constant 5% announced as the “FRAND rate.” That simply cannot be the market price for 30 years.", "Barnett: There are several efficiency explanations for the constant rate (subject to a fixed-dollar cap per device).", "Here’s one. Start with the observation that SEP licenses are typically executed for long periods of time (10 to 15 years) so the parties have agreed from the outset to a fixed percentage (subject to a dollar ceiling per device) throughout the life of the standard.", "If QCOM has market power, it may be asked why it did not preserve latitude to raise the rate over time, which would have enabled it to exploit “producer lock-in” as adoption expanded, network effects went into operation and market value increased.", "A plausible answer is that committing to a long-term fixed rate provides adopters with assurance that royalty rates would remain constant over the course of a technology’s lifetime.", "The implicit royalty cap enables QCOM to commit against holdup and induces producers to invest in the technology, which in turn seeds adoption by consumers, generates a broad sales base from which the IP licensor can extract royalties, and enables the IP licensor to accrue reputational capital that it can deploy to induce adoption when it launches the next iteration of the technology standard (3G, 4G and so on).", "Scott Morton: But the court explains that the 5% “royalty cap” is the holdup. The FRAND commitment gives device makers assurance they are not being over-charged and due to the expiration of patents, royalties will naturally decline over time.", "Singer: Does the consumer-welfare lens of antitrust cause courts tend to overweight the welfare of distributors such as Apple, who serve as proxies for end users, and underweight the welfare of input providers?", "It seems like any advantage for platforms or distributors, even one acquired via merger, that knocks down the price of an input is recognized as a “win” for customers.", "Antitrust scholars Herbert Hovenkamp and Ioana Marinescu write that “To the best of our knowledge no couurt has ever condemned a merger because of its anticompetitive effects in labor markets.”", "Indeed, one dissenting judge (who will go unnamed) in a health insurance merger would have found proof of reduced provider payments an adequate efficiency defense.", "Does antitrust law have a bias against input providers and innovators generally? And does Qualcomm fit this pattern?", "Melamed: There is nothing in the consumer welfare standard that disadvantages input suppliers. See my article with Nicolas Petit in Review of Industrial Organization.", "In any event, this case was about violations by a seller—Qualcomm—and was thus squarely within antitrust’s sweet spot.", "Scott Morton: Symmetry is an interesting idea. I wonder if the folks arguing for Qualcomm would support a minimum wage of $75 rather than $7.50?", "The best paper on this topic is by Hemphill and Rose in last year’s Yale Law Journal explaining that if the bargaining power is obtained through anticompetitive conduct, then the lower prices are not efficiencies, but harms.", "Competitive markets are best served when inputs are purchased at competitive prices. Allocative efficiency is preserved in that case, but also incentives to invest.", "If we drive down the pay of doctors in Anthem Cigna, then doctors will exit those regions and that harms consumers.", "Singer: Let’s move to remedies. Judge Koh ordered that Qualcomm renegotiate its terms with customers at “fair and reasonable” rates.", "I’m trying to figure out how that would work in practice. The opinion suggests ideas such as comparing royalties in markets where Qualcomm is dominant from those where it is not.", "Do we get to exploit sufficient variations in Qualcomm’s royalty rates here? Did the FTC’s experts offer up benchmarks by which Qualcomm’s royalties could be measured on grounds of reasonableness?", "Is there a way to index Qualcomm’s royalty to the comparative strength of its patent position in the standard-essential-patent bundle?", "How does one get at the but-for royalty in practice—that is, the access fee that Qualcomm would charge for its SEPs absent any threat to pull its chips?", "Does the recent sequence of U.S. and European SEP infringement litigations, which address the determination of “FRAND-compliant” royalties for SEPs, give us any insight on this point?", "Scott Morton: Determining FRAND is not unusual now. We have several court decisions that have carried out that task and Qualcomm and OEMs just need to get started.", "The FTC was not being a rate setting agency—remember the above FRAND rate is the way Qualcomm extracts its market power, not the anticompetitive tactics the FTC identified.", "Barnett: Courts have wrestled with this question in SEP infringement litigation over the past few years.", "The results are not encouraging. Reasonable royalties are typically determined in patent law based on a hypothetical negotiation between a willing licensor and licensee.", "To do so, courts typically rely heavily on evidence from comparable licenses. To my knowledge, in all but one SEP litigation so far in the U.S., U.K. and EU, courts have followed this principle.", "But there’s a mismatch problem between judicial and market valuation. While courts seek to apportion the value of individual patents on a strictly “money” basis for damages purposes, markets typically engage in device-level portfolio licensing and trade off price and non-price terms.", "This tends to result in somewhat arbitrary valuation outcomes in court given the absence of any straightforward market benchmark.", "If the court’s order were implemented in this case, this problem would be repeated many times over given the number of licensees and potential appeals to a court or arbitrator in the case of deadlock.", "Singer: Any final thoughts? What do you think happens on appeal?", "Barnett: I think the case is especially vulnerable on Aspen Skiing. Otherwise hard to predict.", "Melamed: I think the basic rulings on the no license/no chips policy and exclusive dealing will be affirmed.", "The rest might be also, but I would not be surprised to see some revisions on those matters.", "Scott Morton: I leave appeals predictions to the attorneys!", "Singer: Well, thanks a zillion for taking the time!

Microsoft case has had since it was decided almost two decades ago.", "Here’s a rundown of the most prominent issues as they are currently presented. As in any hard-fought, high-stakes case, the parties may decide to shift their ground as the case progresses, facts emerge and the judges make preliminary rulings.", "Already the decision by Judge Koh back in June to deny Qualcomm’s motion to dismiss the FTC’s case and the September 7 decisions by Judge Curiel to deny Qualcomm’s motions to bar Apple from pursuing its parallel cases in the UK, Taiwan, China, and Japan and to force Apple’s manufacturers to resume paying license fees while the case continues have had foreboding messages for Qualcomm about where these cases might be heading.", "Ordinarily a patent owner is free not to license its competitors. But when Qualcomm signed on to be part of the cellular communications standard-setting process through organizations (SSOs) such as the European Telecommunication Standards Institute (ETSI), the Telecommunications Industry Association (TIA), and the Alliance for Telecommunications Industry Solutions (ATIS), and then declared certain of its patents “essential” to some of the SSO-adopted cellular standards—including the Universal Mobile Telecommunications System (UMTS), Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA), and Long-Term Evolution (LTE)—for 2G, 3G and 4G smartphones, it agreed to license those patents on reasonable and non-discriminatory (“RAND”—sometimes with “fair” thrown in it’s called “FRAND”) terms.", "Now, the FTC is attacking Qualcomm for refusing to license competing chip manufacturers, instead licensing only chip purchasers.", "Judge Koh ruled in June, in denying Qualcomm’s motion to dismiss the complaint, that the FTC had stated a plausible theory that Qualcomm’s policy was an antitrust violation if it could be proved.", "And so the case goes forward. A final ruling mandating that Qualcomm change its policy could shake up the cellular baseband processor manufacturing industry and perhaps lead to entry by new competitors.", "It would also clarify whether a RAND commitment carries a duty to deal with competitors and not just users of the patented product.", "For antitrust fans, Judge Koh’s preliminary decision was interesting because it relied on a famous three-decades-old Supreme Court decision in the Aspen Skiing case.", "That decision held that the owner of three ski mountains in Aspen had a duty to cooperate with the owner of the fourth mountain to continue selling all-mountain ski lift tickets.", "It is considered by many to be the high-water mark in the law of monopolization, and its scope has been narrowed by later decisions.", "A decision that a RAND commitment automatically puts an owner of one or more standard essential patents into Aspen Skiing territory, required to license competitors, could easily find its way to the Supreme Court.", "Under the patent “exhaustion” doctrine, once you buy a patented product you are free to use it and re-sell it as you see fit, without further permission (license) of the patent owner: the first sale “exhausts” the patent.", "Qualcomm allegedly skirts this rule by refusing to sell its chips to anyone who won’t also buy a package license to a large slew of its patents, which Qualcomm argues are needed to make a smartphone in addition to the patents covering the chips themselves.", "The FTC argues that this tying of the license package to the chips has the effect of diminishing demand for competitors’ chips.", "The theory is that Qualcomm is skewing the overall price toward the license and away from the chips: once the supposedly elevated price for the license is paid, regardless of whether a Qualcomm or Qualcomm competitor processor is used, you might as well buy Qualcomm’s chips (which Qualcomm can sell at a lower price than it otherwise would, thereby squeezing the profit margins of competing chip manufacturers).", "The number of competitors in this corner of the semiconductor industry has declined over the years. Whether a defeat or retreat by Qualcomm on this policy would induce new firms to enter the market is a key question.", "From the public’s point of view, the possibility of new competition in this market is perhaps the most important gain that could come from this litigation.", "In earlier times, it was considered suspect under antitrust law for a patent owner to license its patents in a bundle, rather than patent by patent.", "In fact, compelled “tying” was per se illegal. By now, the law is clear that there can be strong efficiency advantages to portfolio licensing, and so there is no longer a presumption against bundled licenses.", "For instance, it may not be clear which patents are actually infringed by a given product, and a package license permits the parties to avoid complex royalty calculations and expensive litigation by setting one price that covers the licensees’ products regardless of whether they implicate one patent or many.", "Today, the law generally accepts that these benefits make portfolio licensing procompetitive and safe from antitrust attack—at least when the patent owner also offers to license the individual patents à la carte as an alternative.", "Now, however, Apple is faulting Qualcomm for allegedly refusing to license particular patents and insisting that licensees must pay for the entire portfolio for a royalty computed as a percentage of revenue the licensee derives from the licensed product.", "Until now, one effect of this practice has been to disincentivize manufacturers from attacking individual Qualcomm patents: since the user likely needed at least one of Qualcomm’s patents, and the fee was the same if the product infringed one patent or many; there was nothing gained by picking at parts of the Qualcomm portfolio.", "It is generally acknowledged that Qualcomm’s inventions are key pillars of the smartphone revolution.", "Qualcomm has declared thousands of its patents to be essential to the 2G, 3G and 4G standards. Since, as noted above, cell phone purveyors commonly obtain portfolio licenses to use any or all of the Qualcomm patents—and pay for them as a percentage of revenue regardless of how many patents their devices actually employ—the cell phone manufacturers have not had a strong incentive to question particular patents within the formidable portfolio.", "Now Apple has decided to pick apart Qualcomm’s bundle by asking the court for declarations that certain Qualcomm patents are not in fact implicated by Apple products at all.", "The attack only asks for scrutiny of 15 patents out of thousands, so this attack by itself apparently does not threaten the Qualcomm empire; it is one more weapon against which Qualcomm has to mount a defense.", "One very fair way to look at Apple’s beef with Qualcomm is that it really is just a price negotiation being conducted by other means.", "Apple says that it has been attempting to obtain a license directly from Qualcomm for years, but that they’ve never been able to arrive at an agreed price: instead Qualcomm has been licensing Apple’s contract manufacturers.", "In its complaint, Apple argues that Qualcomm’s prices violate its RAND commitment because they are not “reasonable” (the “R” in RAND).", "One proof that Qualcomm’s license prices are not reasonable at 5% of revenue, according to the FTC, is that the 5% rate has remained the same over the years even while Qualcomm’s relative share of SEPs reading on the iPhone has declined as we moved from 2G to 3G to 4G standards and more and more features unrelated to Qualcomm’s inventions were added to smartphones.", "The FTC makes this simple-sounding argument: if Qualcomm deserved 5% of revenue when its patents made up a high share of the declared essential patents to make a 2G phone, how can it still be reasonable to charge 5% of revenue for a 4G phone that has so many additional features and capabilities such that Qualcomm’s share of the essential patents is only 13% of the whole?", "Of course patents are not fungible—by definition each one is original—so they can’t be valued by the pound and simply counting the number of patents, as opposed to considering their relative commercial or practical importance, seemingly should not be the litmus test.", "Contrariwise, one might ask, is it logical to say that the right to use one patent is more valuable than another if both are “essential”?", "Yet, by the same token, 5% of a $600 product that could do a, b, and c is different from 5% of a $1000 product that can do a, b, c, d, e, and f where the licensor’s technology only enabled a, b, and c.", "Whether this is a true antitrust question and not just a contract dispute about enforcing the promise to charge RAND, who decides whether a price is “reasonable”, and by what methods, are all up in the air.", "There are very few precedents in which a court decided a RAND price—including the decision in the Microsoft v. Motorola case, which was treated as a contract dispute—but the law is far from settled and the facts and expert testimony could take us almost anywhere in this case.", "Typically, because of their budget constraints, the antitrust regulators don’t pursue a case if well-funded private companies have sued and are already fighting their own battle.", "Likewise, private plaintiffs often wait till a government case is over to free ride on the benefits of whatever the government has achieved.", "Here, though, Qualcomm has to fight with both the regulators and with Apple, and settling with either one (or persuading it to withdraw) is no guarantee that the other will be satisfied.", "So there’s a pretty good chance this fight will yield some real lessons about standard essential patents, RAND pricing, and portfolio licensing.", "If it leads to greater competition, and better or cheaper smartphones, that would be a bonus for the public.", "If it drags Qualcomm down without any compensating gain in competition, then we’re all losers. It could be years before we have definitive answers from the appellate courts.", "October 15, 2017 04:37 amThank you. Keep it coming. I do a licensing chapter for the State Bar of California and as these cases unfold, I may need updates of that chapter.", "October 12, 2017 07:01 pmGreat explanation of this complicated story."]}

And this where the Envy x2—really, the entire Windows 10 on ARM platform—fails us.", "I elaborated on this issue more in The Problem with Windows 10 on ARM (Premium). But for you non-Premium members in the audience, let me just say this: While Windows 10 on ARM is, in some ways, a technological marvel, the performance and compatibility issues are far too problematic for PC users.", "As Microsoft positions it, Windows 10 on ARM is its attempt to bring the legacy Windows code base to a newer, more mobile-focused hardware platform.", "In doing so, Windows 10 benefits from ARM’s integrated cellular connectivity, stellar battery life, and weeks-long standby times, helping the system behave somewhat like a smartphone.", "Microsoft has been down this road before, of course: Windows RT was a previous attempt at bringing Windows, in that case, Windows 8, to ARM.", "But it suffered from two fundamental stumbling blocks: The performance was terrible and it could not run traditional Windows desktop applications.", "The performance of Windows 10 on ARM is likewise terrible. But this system partially solves the second problem thanks to a Microsoft-created software emulator.", "That is, Windows 10 on ARM can run Windows desktop applications. But it can only run 32-bit desktop applications.", "64-bit apps, like Adobe Photoshop and many others, will never run on Windows 10 on ARM. Neither will software drivers that require an Intel-compatible chipset.", "The issue is that the types of customers who might otherwise be drawn to one of these PCs will not understand which software will and will not work.", "It’s basically a game of whack-a-mole where you just pray for the best. But you will be disappointed: I ran into all kinds of unexpected roadblocks here.", "So the question emerges: Does Windows 10 on ARM make any sense at all?", "My conclusion is that, no, it does not. And that somewhat renders the rest of this review somewhat moot.", "Which is too bad, because the Envy x2 is, in fact, a beautiful and elegant device.", "HP has, perhaps, a few too many premium PC brands in its stable and you may wonder how/where the Envy fits into the scheme of things.", "I think of Envy as a cross-over, if you will, from a branding perspective. Which means that Envy-branded devices fall beneath HP’s premium Spectre (consumer) and Elite (business) products, and above their more mainstream brands like Pavilion.", "From what I can see, this positioning results in the proverbial sweet spot. That is, Envy brings enough style and new technology from HP’s truly premium brands to please virtually anyone.", "And it does so at price points that a far bigger audience can afford.", "For the x2 in particular, the Envy positioning is smart: This device is too underpowered to be a Spectre or Elite product, but it has a beautiful industrial design that elevates it above the mainstream.", "The HP Envy x2 is a wonderfully thin and light portable tablet PC with a 2-in-1 design. It very clearly targets Apple’s 10.5-inch iPad Pro, and is an alternative to the low-end (Core m3) version of Microsoft’s Surface Pro.", "And from a design standpoint, it holds up well in these comparisons. This is an elegant and professional-looking device.", "With its type cover attached, the HP Envy x2 lands at just 0.6 inches (15.29 mm) thick and 2.67 pounds.", "That is just a bit thicker and heavier than an iPad Pro with Smart Keyboard cover, but it provides far more versatility: The HP’s keyboard cover is included, and not an added cost, and it covers the entire device when closed (the Smart Keyboard leaves the back of the iPad Pro exposed).", "It also provides for multiple screen angles, where the Smart Keyboard provides just one, and two keyboard angles where, again, iPad gets just one, flat.", "And, it includes a glass touchpad where no such capability is available on the Apple device.", "I described the Envy x2 as a 2-in-1 because the type cover is included with the device. Truth be told, it’s really just a tablet: You can easily—perhaps a bit too easily—detach the tablet part from the keyboard cover and use it with the HP Pen, which is also included in the cost of the device.", "(Again, unlike iPad Pro, where an Apple Pencil is a $100 extra.)", "By itself, the tablet is elegant, thin (.27 inches) and light (1.54 pounds), and would work well with the HP Pen if it wasn’t so laggy.", "It’s made of a single piece of CNC-machined aluminum with a scratch-resistant Gorilla Glass display, and it has proven to be stiff and durable during my usage.", "There are no fans, thanks to the Qualcomm chipset, and thus no fan noise or excessive heat. It would be a joy to use if it weren’t for the performance issues.", "The Envy x2’s 12.3-inch IPS display is both right-sized for the device and of excellent quality, with a nice 1920 x 1280 resolution and ideal 3:2 aspect ratio, both of which make plenty of sense for a device of this kind.", "It supports both multi-touch and smartpen capabilities, of course. And it is very bright, with deep colors and sharp text.", "There’s no real bad news from a display perspective, but the bezels are a bit big on all sides. I’ve found that to be typical for 2-in-1s and tablets these days.", "The Envy x2 is powered by a Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 processor, a 10 nm System on a Chip (SoC) platform that is designed primarily for smartphones and incorporates Adreno 540 graphics, 2×2 802.11ac wireless, Bluetooth 5, and a speedy X16 LTE modem.", "Most Envy x2s will ship with 4 GB of RAM and a 128 GB SSD. But the review unit came with a more acceptable 8 GB of RAM, plus a 256 GB SSD.", "I would never buy a Windows PC with less than 8 GB of RAM.", "As I noted in my performance check-in, system performance ranges from acceptable to laughably bad, and this is the first modern PC I’ve used that reminded me of a netbook in this regard.", "General UX browsing is fine, and most Store apps seem to run acceptably well. But desktop application performance—including the performance of desktop Store apps like Word 2016 and the rest of Office—is unacceptable.", "The issue there, of course, is Microsoft’s x86-to-ARM emulation software: Since the underlying platform is completely different from that of the applications you want to run, there’s a performance hit.", "While it’s not completely fair to use a performance benchmark to make my performance point, I feel that this one is relevant: My normal video encoding test, in which I convert a 4K video called Tears of Steel to 1080p, took an incredible 2:13:44 to complete on the Envy x2.", "By comparison, the 2017 Surface Pro took about an hour less time, at 1:41:27. Quad-core CPU-based modern PCs like the ThinkPad X1 Carbon are even faster; the PC finished this test in just 1:21.", "The good news? Thanks to the efficient design of the Snapdragon 835, the Envy x2 requires no cooling fans and it runs silently.", "From a ports perspective, the Envy x2 offers a minimalist approach with a single USB-C port that’s used for both power and expansion, a microSD card tray, and a proprietary keyboard cover connector.", "There’s also a combo audio jack that is correctly located on the bottom right of the device when used in landscape mode with the keyboard cover.", "(The USB-C port does not provide Thunderbolt 3 capabilities, but I feel that is acceptable for a device of this class.)", "The Envy x2 also includes two cameras, a 13 MP rear-facing camera and a 5 MP front-facing unit, plus a Windows Hello-compatible IR camera on the front.", "Since always-on connectivity is one of the primary benefits of any Always Connected PC, it should come as no surprise that the HP Envy x2 excels in this area.", "As I noted in my connectivity check-in, the PC provides a Qualcomm Snapdragon X16 cellular modem that supports Category 16 LTE-Advanced at speeds of up 1 Gbps, at least theoretically.", "However, as of this writing, the modem is limited to about 450 Mbps of download bandwidth. (HP says the download speed will improve with firmware updates over time, however.)", "I’ve never achieved speeds like that in about a month of usage using T-Mobile via my Project Fi data SIM, at least to my knowledge.", "But switching between Wi-Fi and LTE is, at least, fairly seamless and I’ve not been bothered by any egregious pop-up warnings as I’d feared.", "And not that it matters, but the way that the Envy x2 works with LTE is no different than how any cellular-equipped Windows 10 PC works.", "There is nothing special or unique about the software interfaces.", "Beyond cellular, the Envy x2 provides the expected 2×2 802.11ac wireless and Bluetooth 5 capabilities, courtesy of a Qualcomm WCN3990 chipset.", "The included keyboard cover is excellent and is roughly comparable to Microsoft’s Surface Pro Type Covers, even though it is made with a cheaper faux-leather polyurethane material.", "But I like it: It seems durable and doesn’t pick up stains, and is in keeping with the Envy brands low-end premium vibe.", "It’s also really versatile: You can use the keyboard flat on the table or tilt it up against the bottom of the screen, as you can with Surface Pro (and can’t with iPad Pro’s Smart Keyboard).", "It also provides a new kickstand design that lets you angle the display itself between 110 degrees and 150 degrees, so you can find the most comfortable orientation.", "The iPad Pro with Smart Keyboard only provides one viewing angle for the display.", "But the keyboard cover suffers from two inconveniences. It’s not terribly lappable, a problem shared by Surface Pro and other 2-in-1 designs.", "And because it attaches in a weird, non-standard way, and with magnets, it’s awkward to open and can separate from the tablet if you are holding it wrong.", "As for the keyboard itself, it is backlit and surprisingly good, with an excellent 1.3 mm of key travel and a solid typing feel.", "Like any typing cover of this kind, there is, of course, a bit of flex, especially if you are a heavy typist like me.", "But it’s minimal and I had no issues cranking out text.", "The glass touchpad is likewise excellent and is refreshingly right-sized, in my opinion, given the push to ever-bigger touchpads these days.", "The HP Pen is less successful: It works pretty well for taking notes, which I’d imagine is its number one use case on this device.", "But those with artistic aspirations should look elsewhere: As I noted in my HP Pen check-in, the performance is laggy enough to be disruptive.", "You won’t find a more agreeable PC from a portability perspective: The Envy x2 is thin and light, but doesn’t skimp on display size or quality, or on the keyboard and pointing experiences.", "Best of all, the battery life is phenomenal: As I first reported in my battery life check-in, the real-world battery life of this PC is almost exactly what HP promised.", "The standby time is as impressive, if less easy to quantify. But I’m seeing weeks of standby time for sure, with the battery life only slowly declining day after day of disuse, thanks to the Snapdragon 835’s power-sipping efficiency cores.", "Is this a major real-world advantage? I’m honestly not sure. If smartphones have taught us anything, it’s the value of charging these devices each night.", "The Envy x2 ships Windows 10 S version 1709, though I expect the PC to eventually come with Windows 10 Pro version 1803 in S mode; regardless, I upgraded it to Pro like anyone else would.", "The PC ships with crapware from both Microsoft and HP, which is unfortunate. On the HP side, we see unnecessary apps like Phototastic Collage, Priceline.com, and a few others, but HP’s normal first-party utilities are nowhere to be seen, no doubt because they are Win32 desktop applications that will not work in S mode.", "Drivers and system updates are instead delivered through the Store, as is the case with Surface PCs. I prefer that.", "The bigger software story, of course, is compatibility. And as I wrote in my compatibility check-in, it’s not a good story:", "The Envy x2 can run any 32-bit Store or (once you’ve switched out of Windows 10 S) desktop application, but it cannot run any 64-bit apps.", "Worse, it cannot install any normal x86/x64 drivers, which is a cute way of saying that it cannot install any drivers.", "Worse, it’s an unknown: You won’t know when you download an application or utility from the Internet whether it will even work.", "And the nonsensical error messages that Windows provides don’t help in the slightest.", "HP offers two versions of the Qualcomm-powered Envy x2. The base version, for $999, includes 4 GB of RAM and a 128 GB SSD.", "For $1299, you can upgrade to a version with 8 GB of RAM and a 256 GB SSD. Looking at HP’s website today, however, I only see one model offered, the base unit, and it’s out of stock.", "Despite its thin, light, and pretty industrial design, the HP Envy x2 addresses a potential market so small that it may, in fact, be imaginary.", "This device strikes all the wrong compromises, and I believe that most potential customers would prefer and be much better served by a PC that offered normal performance and compatibility with half the battery life and standby time of the Envy x2.", "This isn’t HP’s fault, of course. And the PC giant did what it could to overcome the inherent limitations of the platform.", "But the performance and compatibility problems are very real, and with HP and other PC makers offering Intel-based Always Connected PCs too, there is no need to compromise on what really matters.", "Put simply, I cannot recommend the HP Envy x2 or any other Qualcomm-based Always Connected PC at this time.", "<blockquote><a href=\"#266320\"><em> In reply to JG1170:</em></a></blockquote><p>I think fashion conscious Windows users buy a macbook and run Windows on it.", "There's not a lot of bragging rights associated with Windows PCs. </p>", "<blockquote><a href=\"#266858\"><em> In reply to JG1170:</em></a></blockquote><p>I guess I'm not a connoisseur of laptops, they all look about the same to me.", "Besides, at some point you reach the age where you don't care what the other kids think – you're just there to work.</p>", "<blockquote><a href=\"#266304\"><em> In reply to Simard57:</em></a></blockquote><p>Of course people understand that high-powered applications or high-performance games may require resources beyond what is typically available \"out of the box\" for average systems.", "The difference is that those issues can often be addressed by adding more RAM or a better graphics card.", "There's no upgrade path to allow applications to run on a Windows on ARM PC with an OS that wasn't designed to run those applications.</p>", "<blockquote><a href=\"#266413\"><em> In reply to Simard57:</em></a></blockquote><p>It depends.

If there’s an incoming call, you can choose to ignore or answer it, but if you choose the latter, you’ll actually have to pick up your phone or use a Bluetooth headset.", "The rest of the notifications just serve as previews, and you can’t take any action from the watch itself.", "I found battery life on the Toq to be decent, though not significantly better than some of the other smartwatches out there.", "I was able to go about four days before needing to recharge the Toq. My colleague Lauren Goode got about the same result with the Samsung Galaxy Gear.", "The watch can be recharged wirelessly — another technology Qualcomm is touting, and, admittedly it looks pretty cool.", "It comes with a little stand where you can place the watch to juice up, though the accessory itself needs to be plugged into an outlet.", "While there are some bright spots to the Qualcomm Toq, at this point, it’s much more of a demonstration of some of the technology that could power future smartwatches, rather than a viable product, so for the time being, save your money."]}

It sports a gorgeous Mirasol display (more on that in a second), its face is the thinnest of any smartwatch I've used, and it's plenty comfortable to wear.", "Qualcomm also snuck the watch's battery into the band's clasp, which helped to keep that face slim and trim.", "The Toq's band is a permanent part of the watch, so there's no swapping with another one, like some of the other smartwatches let you do.", "The band is made of a textured and flexible plastic, and it feels much higher-end than the bands on some of the other early smartwatches.", "You do actually have to cut the Toq's band when setting it up, though, to fit to your wrist. It can be resized again to a smaller size, but, once you cut it, it can never be sized bigger again.", "So you'd better not gain any weight around your wrist if you don't want your investment to go down the toilet.", "This might also give you some trouble if you plan on selling the Toq or passing it on to a friend.", "Of all the early smartwatches, the Qualcomm Toq's screen is my favorite. The Mirasol display on this puppy is colorful, sharp (223 pixels per inch), and looks outstanding under direct sunlight.", "Even if the Toq is far from a must-have consumer product, it serves as a great showcase for Mirasol display tech in future smartwatches.", "I hope the makers of tomorrow's batch of watches are paying attention, and striking deals with Qualcomm to use the tech again.", "One of the keys here is that the Toq's screen is always on, always ready to be looked at. And if you choose a clock face with a weather, stock, or calendar widget, then you have some key info that's never more than a glance away.", "One thing the Mirasol display doesn't have is a wide range of colors. This isn't a nuanced palette like you'd find on a high-quality tablet, smartphone, or laptop display.", "It's more like black, white, and a couple varations each of blue, orange, yellow, red, green, and purple.", "There may or may not actually be more color variation than that, but that's the general effect that I see.", "What the Toq's Mirasol display lacks in color variation, though, it makes up for in outdoor readability.", "It picks up reflections, but they never come off as distracting glare. It's also readable in moderate indoor lighting.", "If it gets too dark, you can double-tap its band just above the screen to fire up its backlight. And unlike the Pebble smartwatch, the Toq's display is a touch screen, so no need to fiddle with physical buttons for anything.", "Like nearly every other smartwatch so far, the Toq is a smartphone accessory, not a smartphone replacement.", "You'll need to pair it (via Bluetooth) with an Android phone running Android 4.0 Ice Cream Sandwich or higher.", "It isn't compatible with iPhones, Blackberries, or Windows Phones.", "Smartwatches like the Samsung Galaxy Gear try, with varying degrees of success, to cram in long lists of features and functions.", "The Toq, however, has a much smaller feature set. Qualcomm describes the watch as a glanceable second screen for your smartphone, and I think that's a pretty accurate description.", "It's primarily a notification terminal for your wrist.", "Fortunately the Toq handles its main job pretty well. It supports full Android notifications, so there aren't any apps that will be left out of the party.", "You can also customize which apps it shows notifications from, so your wrist doesn't get spammed with Candy Crush alerts.", "Like other smartwatches, of course, it vibrates your wrist to let you know when those notifications come in.", "If you only get one new email, the Toq's notification center will show you the full message, no matter how long it is (the actual alert will be abbreviated, but the notification applet will show the full message).", "But if you have more than one new email come in, the Toq will cram short summaries of all of them onto one card, leaving longer emails cut off.", "I find this to be an annoying limit. If I'm buying an expensive product just to get notifications on my wrist, I want to be able to read full emails – no matter how many and how long.", "That notification center lives in the Toq's applet screen. From the watch's main clock screen (which you can choose from among fourteen options), tap the watch's band just below its face, and you'll enter the applet center.", "There you'll see icons for your recent phone and SMS history, calendar events, music controls, weather, stocks, and recent notifications.", "There's also a watch status icon and an applet for the Toq's settings. You can swipe to the right to back out of any applet, and you tap on the band below the screen again to return to the main clock screen.", "The Toq doesn't have a microphone or speaker, so you can't do things like make phone calls or use Google Now voice control on your wrist.", "If you use a Bluetooth headset, though, you can use the Toq to initiate a call without pulling out your phone.", "There's also no camera, though it's debatable whether that's really an essential smartwatch feature.", "The Toq's feature set is similar to rivals like the Pebble and Sony SmartWatch 2, but with one big omission: there aren't yet any compatible fitness-tracking apps.", "The wrist is a great place to show glanceable pedometer info from a run or walk, so I'm not sure why Qualcomm didn't bother partnering with someone for that.", "It could easily be added with a future software update, but so far no dice.", "The Toq's Mirasol display uses very little power, which helps give the watch outstanding battery life.", "In my use, after six full days off the charger, the Toq still had about 25 percent battery remaining.", "Granted, this was mostly with light use, so it could drain faster if you use the backlight frequently or read tons of notifications.", "All in all, though, we're looking at insane uptimes, the best I've seen on a smartwatch.", "It's a little ironic, then, that the Toq is the easiest to charge of all the current smartwatches. It ships with a wireless charging station, and it seems to be just about the ideal way to go for smartwatches.", "Open the folding dock, press a button to flip up a stand, and rest the watch on the sensors in front of it.", "No plugs, no cords (apart from the one that connects to the dock), just drop your watch on the station and go.", "The dock also has sections for docking Qualcomm's optional wireless earbuds, which will launch some time in 2014.", "So is the Qualcomm Toq worth buying? Well, I can see both sides here. On one hand, I think its screen, design, and battery life are the best of all the early smartwatches.", "Its bundled wireless charger is a piece of cake to use, and the watch has an overall high-end aesthetic.", "On the other hand ... well, the Toq doesn't really do a whole lot. It handles notifications well, but if you're trying to read multiple emails at once, you'd better hope they're all really short.", "You can check stocks, the weather, and calendar events, but you can forget about fitness tracking, phone calls, or voice control.", "Oh, and did we mention that its US$350 price tag makes it the most expensive smartwatch around?", "So as a consumer product right now, the Toq is a mixed bag. It has a nice simple focus, but we wouldn't blame you for wanting more functionality for your money.", "As a showcase device, though, I think Qualcomm hit the nail right on the head. I would love to see the company's Mirasol screens, design sensibilities, and wireless charging in the next wave of smartwatches.", "If smartwatch OEMs use the Toq as a starting point, add some new killer features and more fully-baked software, and get the price down closer to $200-250, then they could be onto something.", "The Qualcomm Toq is recommended if you're looking for a simple, glanceable second display on your wrist – and you don't mind paying a premium for it.", "It's highly recommended, though, for smartwatch-makers who are seeking display, design, and charging inspiration for their future products.", "The Toq is available now from the product page and Amazon links below."]}

There could even be a situation in which a claim construction is modified in HTC's favor, but past infringements are still identified.", "A narrower claim construction would still be helpful with a view to workarounds.", "The fifth question the Commission asked the parties to comment on represents an opportunity for HTC to avoid an import ban altogether because it could result in a successful patent exhaustion defense:", "\"5. Whether the Federal Circuit's decision in Lifescan Scotland, Ltd. v. Shasta Techs, LLC, 734 F.3d 1361", "(Fed. Cir. 2013), or any other relevant court decisions, affects HTC's defense of patent exhaustion based on the transfer of rights under the Nokia-Qualcomm agreement.\"", "In that case, the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit recently reversed a decision by the United States District Court for the Northern District of California in a medical device patent case and found that the defendant had a meritorious patent exhaustion defense.", "The fact that the Commission considers this decision (at least potentially) relevant to the Nokia-HTC case is good news for HTC, though Nokia will certainly seek to distinguish that other case from its own, and the devil is in the details (of license agreements and technical implementations) when a patent exhaustion defense is analyzed.", "In May 2013, the ALJ had summarily tossed HTC's (and Google's) patent exhaustion defense. Both parties petitioned for a review: HTC wanted to prevail on its defense, and Nokia wanted an even better outcome with a view to the wider implications of this highly strategic issue.", "The Commission decided at the time that it would take a look at patent exhaustion only after the initial determination, but not at the summary judgment stage.", "In another jurisdiction, the UK, Nokia just defeated a patent exhaustion defense by HTC relating to the Nokia-Qualcomm agreement and won an injunction.", "But patent exhaustion is jurisdiction-specific and an outcome in one country does not necessarily guarantee the same result in another venue.", "The patent exhaustion part of this case is not only an opportunity for HTC to solve the whole problem based on a single defense but it's also going to be the most closely-watched issue as far as third parties are concerned.", "Various other Qualcomm customers may also have to work out license agreements with Nokia in the near term due to (mostly) expiration or (in some cases) the absence of existing agreements.", "Despite its claims that it can, if necessary, work around Nokia's patents, HTC has mobilized various supporters who told the ITC that an import ban against HTC's Android devices would not be in the public interest (or that there should at least be a \"grace period\" for HTC to change its products).", "HTC also tried (and still hopes) to benefit from the Microsoft-Nokia deal and brought a motion in September to stay this ITC investigation pending the closing of the transaction, arguing that Nokia had established a domestic industry for the asserted patents based on the sale of its own products but meanwhile agreed to sell the division that makes those domestic industry products to Microsoft.", "Judge Thomas Pender gave that transparent attempt to stall the case short shrift. The ITC does not appear to be too interested in it at this stage, but HTC will probably re-raise this issue at the enforcement stage should an import ban issue and be enforced after the closing of the Microsoft-Nokia deal.", "And I believe Nokia will then still be able to establish a domestic industry, but the ITC apparently wants to cross the bridge if and when it gets there, not now.", "Last week the United States Department of Justice as well as the European Commission cleared the Microsoft-Nokia deal unconditionally without a need for an in-depth review.", "In a speech in which the EU's top antitrust enforcer, European Commission Vice President Joaquín Almunia, also expressed doubts about the adequacy of Samsung's antitrust settlement proposal regarding standard-essential patents (SEPs), it was stated clearly that the scope of a merger review is limited to the newly-combined entity and not to fears over what the seller (in this case, the remaining Nokia entity) might do after the deal.", "Mr. Almunia threatened antitrust action against Nokia should it distort competition by taking advantage of its future status as a non-practicing entity in connection with mobile devices.", "However, I don't think that warning means anything in practical terms. Nokia monetizes SEPs and non-SEPs.", "For SEPs, the European Commission should now prove in the Samsung and Motorola Mobility cases that it's still serious about defending the market.", "Whatever rules the EU establishes will then apply to everyone, including Nokia. For non-SEPs, it will be incredibly difficult to come up with a credible theory of antitrust violations.", "Nokia is, in principle, free to charge as much for its non-SEPs as it wants -- those who don't like the terms are free to work around them.", "That does not mean to say that there can never be an antitrust abuse theory with respect to non-SEPs, but it's far harder to develop one than in a SEP context.", "In the weeks ahead, while Nokia and HTC will be working on their responses to the ITC's questions on review, three German Nokia v. HTC decisions are scheduled to come down.", "A decision scheduled for last Friday was postponed to December 20, and Nokia appeared to be on the winning track with regard to its patent-in-suit, a USB-related patent, at a recent trial.", "In October a different panel of judges of the same court -- the Munich I Regional Court -- also held a trial over two other Nokia v. HTC cases, which I did not attend, so I don't know what the outcome will be (the first hearings didn't look great for Nokia, but the hurdles it faced then weren't necessarily insurmountable in the further process).", "One ruling was scheduled for today but postponed to December 30, 2013. Another one was scheduled for January 9, 2014.", "There are also some Nokia v. HTC trials coming up soon in another German court, the Dusseldorf Regional Court.", "If you'd like to be updated on the smartphone patent disputes and other intellectual property matters I cover, please subscribe to my RSS feed (in the right-hand column) and/or follow me on Twitter @FOSSpatents and Google+."]}

The company noted AECN issues generated the most complaints last year, as well.", "In response, automotive OEMs last year began demanding that electronics components last 18 years with zero failures.", "This is partly due to the fact that consumers are less likely to buy their next car from the same company if there are repeated failures, a problem made worse by the fact that the number of chips and electronic components in cars is rising rapidly.", "Audi reports about 7,000 semiconductor devices in its high-end models, and it turns out about 4,000 cars every day.", "A failure in the range of one part per million equals 24 defective cars per day. For BMW, which uses about half as many electronic components but manufactures 10,000 cars every day, that equates to 54 defective cars.", "And that’s just for starters, because the amount of electronic content in cars is rising.", "“Electronics will account for 35% of the cost of a car soon,” said Michael Schuldenfrei, corporate technology fellow at Optimal Plus.", "“And with autonomous driving coming, by 2030 PWC thinks it will be 50% of the cost of the car. If you think about where the cars are today and where they’re going to be tomorrow, this is a problem.”", "It gets worse, too, because real-world data doesn’t exist for many of the components that will be used in vehicles.", "“In 1995, the automotive market was using semiconductors at mature nodes,” Schuldenfrei said. “Those semiconductor devices were going into radios or electric windows, which were relatively simple systems.", "Now, a car needs to have the absolute latest and greatest technology to deliver all of the features that ADAS sensors require.", "There’s no longer the comfort zone for the automotive industry to know they’re using five-year-old technology, where the failure modes and problems are known.", "They’re now right at the bleeding edge, and no one knows how stable those technologies really are or what the problems are going to be.”", "Other experts agree. “Normally it takes five to six years before you know if there is a problem,” said Jim McLeish, senior quality/reliability consultant manager at Dfr Solutions.", "“With 5nm to 7nm technology, there is no experience. We don’t know what the variation will be.”", "Bringing this problem under control will require an in-depth understanding at both the system and the circuit level, but right now there is not enough data to be able to draw good conclusions about where problems may erupt and why.", "“What you actually do with the components is that you use them in the beginning to establish confidence that the device will work in the useful lifetime,” said Gert Jørgensen, senior vice president of sales and marketing for Delta’s ASIC Division.", "“Then, of course, when they get older, they are aging and they’re wearing out. This is the lifetime of components—all components.", "In cars we want a higher reliability because it could mean a lot if that device is not working.”", "One of the places where failures are showing up in the automotive world is the standard plastic or ceramic packaging that were largely chosen on the basis of cost, according to numerous sources.", "This is starting to change, particularly as the automotive industry begins utilizing design tools that have been part of advanced semiconductor design for years.", "But it also indicates that gaps remain in the expertise of chip companies, which have never worked in the automotive space, and automotive suppliers and OEMs, which have no experience with some of the issues in advanced-node chip design and manufacturing.", "Both sides are struggling to close those gaps, and in some cases the solutions aren’t easy to digest.", "“What’s happening now is that we’re starting to see things like integrated passive devices being tested in the context of packaging,” said Joey Tun, principal market development manager at National Instruments.", "“That’s a lot different than in the past, where it was just the processor or the memory. Integrated passives typically were tested before they were put into a package.", "So things like inductors, capacitors and resistors were fabricated on a wafer and tested at the wafer level.", "But you can’t measure them accurately on the wafer with high throughput and high volume very easily.”", "With automotive and industrial applications, this includes such things as bias temperature instability and impedance.", "Passives are normally tested individually, but in safety-critical applications or those under harsh conditions they need to be tested in proximity to others to prevent electromechanical coupling.", "This is well within the capabilities of testing equipment today, but it’s not quick or cheap.", "The use of 10/7nm chips in automotive applications is making test more challenging, as well.", "“Test times are getting longer,” said Adrian Kwan, business development manager at Advantest. “The tests are getting bigger.", "There are a lot more transistors in a given area. That requires higher test coverage, and a lot of testers are in the beginning phase of bringing technology up to an acceptable level.”", "It also requires more testing in general to deal with more complexity, according to Ira Leventhal, new concept product initiative vice president at Advantest.", "“This has gotten so complex that things like wafer sort and final test are no longer sufficient. Companies doing advanced chips are relying on system-level test, so now you have to add system-level test insertion as well as deep learning related to hardware and software.", "And you need sufficient built-in self-test because you can’t predict everything. And with hardware and software, you need functional test to make sure you develop to spec.”", "Despite all of this, some level of failure is inevitable—no matter how stringent the requirements by OEMs and Tier 1 suppliers.", "Electronics wear out for a variety of reasons. It could be due to a design flaw from a last-minute change, but it also can be caused by a dust particle trapped in a thin film or a gas flow problem when a chip is being etched.", "And there is plenty of research into what happens when a stray alpha particle hits a 7nm transistor.", "“We can rely on stats all day long for manufacturing, but if something is different it can be within the control or spec,” said Julie Ply, quality engineering manager at Brewer Science.", "“It’s like looking for a needle in a haystack. the first step is getting the data. The next step is understanding what the data means.", "Then you have to bring that back to the process. Is it within the allowable limits of the process or outside the limits?”", "Moreover, it’s not always clear what is a killer defect and what isn’t. Some latent defects may never cause failures, while others that are less obvious can develop into more serious issues under various environmental conditions or excessive vibration, as shown in Fig.", "Fig. 2: Potential defect versus killer defect. Source: KLA", "While efforts are underway to prevent and identify these effects, there also are efforts to be able deal with problems when they do arise.", "So in addition to parts being made more reliable, they also have to be easier to replace.", "“When you get to the time in their life when electronic control units begin wearing out, that’s going to be problematic,” said Jay Rathert, senior director of strategic collaborations at KLA.", "“Plus, you have the weight with all of the cable harnesses. But if you can get rid of that and network the actuators to these domain controllers, if they wear out you can swap them out like a laptop.", "Adding to the complexity, different technologies have different parameters that can accelerate aging.", "“One acceleration factor is temperature,” said Delta’s Jørgensen. “Another exploration factor is voltage.", "If a device is assigned to work 12 volts—that is a car battery normally—and it then worked at 24, it is harder for the device to work at 24.", "You also have different parameters like humidity, voltage, temperature, mechanical shock, which are acceleration factors.", "And by that, you then simulate lifetime. Now you have the problem—how much do you accelerate its life?", "What you want to simulate is, of course, around 20 years lifetime in a car. And you want to do it fast, so you get a result normally after three months.", "You can calculate if you want to see one failure in 20 years. If if you want to see one failure within one month, then a lot of components are used.", "If you want to see one failure in 20 years, you can add let’s say more components and then you get more operational hours.", "If you want to simulate that one device has a failure in 20 years, you take maybe 1,000 devices and run them for one hour.", "That is 1,000 operational hours. That’s why you take out more components and make lifetime testing, so that it happens faster, because what you actually want is to demonstrate how many failures you have in number of operational hours.", "That is called FIT. One failure in 109 hour is defined as one FIT.”", "Jørgensen noted that different automotive levels have different failure in time quality measures. “A consumer level will probably have a 100 FIT quality level, while safety-critical maybe will have 0.1 FIT.", "You have to simulate lifetime depending on the classification of the device. There are also electronic devices in a car that are not safety-critical, like the electronics to control battery charging.", "Next you simulate that your device lives up to these different quality levels. To calculate what effect the different acceleration factors gives, you use the Arrhenius equation.”", "In the end, no one is quite sure how well this will all work. There are an enormous number of variables in a car, and there are many variables in designing chips at advanced nodes, from process variation to minute defects.", "The key is to understand and quantify those variables, and then to use all of the knowledge accumulated on both sides to be able to predict flaws and find killer defects.", "“Safety-critical applications will require additional testing as we better understand the defect mechanisms,” said Anil Bhalla, senior manager at Astronics.", "“The industry is assuming this will work based on early trials. More trials on a broader scale will support the gradual roll-out of this new technology.", "The economics of autonomous driving is motivating the entire semiconductor ecosystem to evolve during this transition.”", "At this point, it appears there is still a long way to go.", "For anticipating failure and more precisely to understand failure mechanisms in semiconductor devices for highly reliable applications, large scale instruments can also be used.", "For instance, in situ or in operando characterisations (for temperature or mechanical cycling) can give info on multiphysics phenomena happening simultaneously.", "The qualification of components demands more and more tests, these large-scale facilities can accelerate this process considerably…anyway, the reliability challenge is also an opportunity !", "It is good to finally see the semiconductor industry become more aware and more responsive to the increasing challenges in using consumer electronics in automotive applications.", "While the highest visibility programs typically have the resources to identify and resolve reliability issues upfront, the remaining 90% of ECUs struggle with lack of information and lack of support.", "For those engineers, we believe best practice is to use industry-standard degradation algorithms (Black’s equation, etc.)", "in combination with SAE J3168 compliant workflows to provide the necessary predictions for wearout and aging of state-of-the-art devices.", "More details can be found in our paper, “Alternate Approach to Prediction of IC Failures Using Silicon Based Degradation Mechanisms” at https://www.dfrsolutions.com/hubfs/Alternate%20Approach%20to%20Prediction%20of%20IC%20Failures%20Using%20Silicon%20Based%20Degradation%20Mechanisms%20.pdf", "Aging and wearout of advanced-technology CMOS logic and memory devices have plagued the aerospace industry for many years, and as CMOS technology continues to progress, those issues are becoming apparent to automotive and other high-performance-high-reliability industries.", "The SAE Avionics Process Management Committee has just released SAE ARP6338A to revise and update standard processes to address aging and wearout of CMOS devices; and that document also is available to other industries.", "Aging/wearout is a technically complex issue, requiring up-to-date knowledge and tools; and the aging/wearout module of the Sherlock software (developed by DfR Solutions) is directly applicable to this issue.", "May I get some reports/study indicating failure of car ECUs due to extreme temperature variations?

(YSI, Yellow Spring, OH, USA) (Fig.", "1B). Several metrics can be computed over these differences, such as %20/20-ISO boundaries, absolute relative difference, and mean absolute relative difference (MARD)", "[10]. Among these quantities, MARD is the most common metric currently used in the literature to assess CGM accuracy [11], and the one on which we will focus hereafter.", "In 2004, Medtronic (Medtronic Minimed, Northridge, CA, USA) introduced and successfully commercialized the first real-time CGM system for personal use: the Medtronic Real-Time Guardian.", "This system provided patients with a glucose concentration value every 5 minutes, lasted 3 days, and it was able to sound an alarm when the glucose concentration level became either too high or too low, helping users to improve glucose control.", "The Medtronic Real-Time Guardian's MARD was estimated to be 15%. Dexcom Inc. (San Diego, CA, USA) commercialized the Dexcom SEVEN Plus, which had longer lifetime, lasting up to 7 consecutive days.", "The accuracy of the Dexcon SEVEN Plus was 16.7% [12], slightly worst of that of the Medtronic Real-Time Guardian, but significantly better than that of its predecessor.", "The same year, the Abbott Freestyle Navigator (Abbott Diabetes Care, Alameda, CA, USA) was marketed, featuring a glucose sensor that could be worn up to 5 days and achieving an MARD of 12.8% [13].", "Compared to SMBG, whose MARD falls between 5% and 10%, the low accuracy (i.e., elevated MARD) of these “first generation” CGM systems represented one of the major barrier for the early adoption of these devices by both users, who felt unsafe in adopting CGM, and many leading diabetologists, whose reluctance to integrate CGM sensors in the daily diabetes management greatly limited the spreading of this technology.", "In the last decade, CGM manufacturers invested many efforts to overcome the problems of lack of accuracy of their first generation devices.", "The first new generation product was the Medtronic Enlite CGM system.

This CGM system is the first that required no fingerstick testing during wear.", "In addition, it extended the wear time up to 14 days. Unlike Dexcom or Medtronic CGM devices, the Freestyle Libre does not sound any alarms if BG falls out of the safe glycemic range and it requires patient to wave the receiver over the transmitter in order to get BG information, and to do so at least one time every 8 hours in order not to lose data.", "For this reason, the Freestyle Libre is labelled as a flash glucose monitoring (FGM) device, i.e., a device that measures BG at continuous time but displays the measured values only when scanning the sensor with the receiver.", "The Freestyle Libre has been the first glucose monitoring device that required no calibrations, with the additional advantage of performing similarly in terms of both accuracy and BG control compared to CGM devices that require two or more calibrations per day, e.g., the G4 Platinum and the Freestyle Navigator II [19].", "Following this technological trend, Dexcom launched in 2017 the G6 [20], a CGM system that can be used without in vivo calibrations, for 10 consecutive days, ensuring the same accuracy of the G5 Mobile.", "In the same year, Medtronic introduced the Guardian Sensor 3, whose accuracy was quantified as 10.6% and 9.1% MARD", "[21], when inserted in the abdomen and in the arm, respectively.

Why? I don’t actually need to. In fact, glancing at my wrist right now, I see that I climbed 36 flights of stairs today and barely cracked 11,000 steps.", "So, I’m comfortable letting that goal go.

The jagged peaks of the Dolomites jutting up from the earth, the crystal-clear lakes filling the valleys, and the lush green hillsides are overwhelming.", "It should be easy, ascending and descending the never-ending switchbacks, to erase memories of the uninspiring first-generation Audi Q3.", "Introduced in 2011 for other markets, the Q3 made its way to the United States for the 2015 model year to establish Audi's presence in the booming luxury-subcompact market.", "But it was underpinned by a prehistoric platform, its interior could have been dated by radiocarbon, and its styling was as bland as Kansas Thai food.", "The second-generation Q3 starts with a clean sheet. Crack open the Audi Q8, split the Q7's shell, and pull apart the Q5, and you'll eventually work your way down to the 2019 Q3, which replaces the soft, dumpling-like look of its predecessor with a version of the octagonal grille and taut body lines that make up Audi's current upright, aggressive design language.", "Each of the two trim levels features a unique fascia. The base model's nose is subdued, while the S line's larger faux air intakes and chiseled splitter present a far less benign face.", "Full-LED lights at all four corners are standard equipment. If you like the contrasting black wheel arches and rocker sills, as we do, you're out of luck.", "On U.S.-market vehicles, those pieces will be matched to the body color.", "The more important changes are the structural and mechanical ones. The Volkswagen Group's versatile MQB architecture replaces the dated PQ35 platform, and the Q3 grows in every dimension, approaching Q5 territory.", "At 176.5 inches overall, it is 3.7 inches longer than the outgoing Q3 and just 7.1 inches shy of the Q5.", "Much of that growth—three inches—occurs between the wheel centers, stretching the wheelbase to 105.5 inches.", "Width pushes out by an inch, and height increases by the same margin.", "A turbocharged 2.0-liter inline-four offers two output levels, straddling the previous 200-hp four's.", "Both versions of the engine provide more torque earlier in the rev range than the old mill. A 184-hp variant motivates base models, producing 236 lb-ft of torque.", "We sampled only the higher-output version, good for 228 horsepower and 258 lb-ft, mated to a seven-speed dual-clutch automatic transmission.", "There's a moment of lag at initial tip-in, but once rolling, the Q3 is sufficiently quick for a small SUV.", "Here in the States, an eight-speed automatic, which we did not sample, will be the only transmission offered.", "All-wheel drive is standard on every model, and there will be no front-drive version. The Quattro hardware carries over from the outgoing Q3, although minor software tweaks improve efficiency, allowing the system to decouple the rear axle via an electronically controlled clutch pack and operate as a front-driver in certain situations.", "To cut costs, Audi will offer only the regular suspension in the U.S., forgoing the Sport and adaptive-damper packages available overseas.", "Over northern Italy's buttery-smooth roads, the busy ride of the last Q3 is absent, due in part to the longer wheelbase.", "Just the harshest impacts, such as thwacking an exposed manhole cover, reverberate through the cabin.", "We drove only Q3s equipped with 20-inch wheels wrapped in large 255-millimeter summer rubber and expect the smaller 18- and 19-inch wheel offerings to return even smoother rides.", "Although the steering effort is feather light and feedback is muffled, inputs through the steering wheel are translated with urgency, the Q3 changing direction gracefully and with minimal body roll.", "The brakes are much better, too. Gone is the old softness; in its place is a firm, progressive pedal that allows easy modulation.", "The Q3's interior is well sorted and has the most modern feel in the segment. Leather is standard, and the seating position is vastly improved, with an airy greenhouse and a panoramic sunroof.", "Synthetic suede divides the dash horizontally (it's also available on the armrests). A 10.3-inch digital gauge cluster is standard, and Audi’s 12.2-inch Virtual Cockpit configurable instrument panel is optional.", "An 8.8-inch dash-mounted infotainment display is also included, and a 10.1-inch screen is available. This is the first use of the brand's haptic touchscreen in a single-display application, as opposed to the two-screen approach that's used in larger Audis.", "The system responds rapidly and renders the backup camera and available bird's-eye view", "in high resolution. The presence of analog HVAC controls in the new Q3 is a welcome change over Audi's ostensibly more advanced two-touchscreen setup.", "Both control systems are angled toward the driver by 10 degrees.", "That longer wheelbase is a boon for interior real estate. The rear seats offer an adjustable recline function and 5.9 inches of fore and aft movement, providing ample space for adults of all sizes.", "The cargo hold grows two cubes over the previous generation's, to 19 cubic feet. Of course, all manner of electronic-driver-assistance systems are available, including standard automated emergency braking.", "Audi hasn't announced pricing yet, but figure about $37,000 when it hits dealerships late next summer or early fall.", "It comes with enough standard equipment to credibly call itself an entry-luxury crossover, and it is a significant improvement over the ute it replaces.", "Vehicle type: front-engine, all-wheel-drive, 5-passenger, 4-door hatchback", "turbocharged and intercooled DOHC 16-valve 2.0-liter inline-4, 184 or 228 hp, 236 or 258 lb-ft"]}

The entry-level Sport trim loses a few of the sharper angles around the front vents, while the top-end Vorsprung model comes with contrasting trim highlights and 20-inch 5-spoke star design alloy wheels.", "But regardless of the model, the Q3 is a good-looking SUV, mixing enough flair to pull an admiring glance or two - but without overdoing things so as to look ostentatious.", "Audi has given the Q3's cabin a solid makeover, significantly modernising the car's look over its predecessor.", "The trim and switchgear of the older car has been refreshed with sharper compact designs and digital readouts to make better use of dashboard space, while the metal-effect trims look smarter and more refined.", "One thing that hasn't changed is Audi's level of build quality, with pretty much every part of the Q3's inside feeling solid, including the rotary air conditioning dials.", "The one exception is a chunk of plastic below the aforementioned dials where a volume knob sits but nothing else; it looks a bit like an oversight by Audi's designers.", "Copious use of soft-touch materials make the cabin a nice place to sit, though you'll want the S Line spec to get the trim in a mix of leather and cloth to get the premium Audi feel.", "While people with more cash to burn can opt for the sport seats and interior to be slathered in Alcantara and leather.", "It does look good when it is, so it's money well spent.", "Speaking of dried out cow skin, the leather-covered steering wheel of the fully-kitted out S Line model we had to test feels very nice.", "Audi hasn't festooned it with buttons either, which means you're left feeling like a driver rather than someone operating a small plane.", "There's also a decent amount of space in the back seats and boot thanks to the new Q3 being a little larger than its predecessors (some 97mm longer and 18mm wider - which doesn't sound like a lot but it does have real-world impact).", "That means there's plenty of space for two adults to sit comfortably in the back, though fitting in a fifth person would be a squeeze.", "As for the boot, there's 530 litres of luggage room; push the rear seats forward and that becomes 675-litres; lay them flat and there's 1,525-litres of total space.", "That trumps rival SUVs like the Volvo XC40 ad BMW X1.", "While Audi offers a good handful of options for the Q3's exterior design, there are frankly a bewildering amount of options for the Q3's interior.", "These range from the aforementioned leather trims and heated seats to ambient lighting packs, privacy glass and panoramic glass sunroof.", "But go for the S Line and you'll be well covered with a smattering of included ones without breaking the bank.", "Where you will want to splash the cash is with the car's tech, and there's a lot to spend your money on.", "Like every refreshed Audi over 2018 and 2019, the Q3 gets the car maker's Virtual Cockpit, which as standard comes with a 10.25-inch digital instrument cluster for the driver, plus a separate 10.1-inch touchscreen display for the infotainment unit.", "Both screens are sharp and clear, but an extra £250 gets you a larger 12.3-inch instrument cluster that can display more data and provides a 3D navigation map.", "It might seem like a fair bit to shell out for an extra bit of information, but it adds to the whole Audi experience and is very pleasant to glance at while navigating around.", "The infotainment screen is also a tech tour de force, with sharp graphics and subtle haptic feedback that makes navigating the menus when on the move - as a passenger, anyway - feel more intuitive.", "At times there can be a few too many menus to tap through; on a twisty, bumpy road the ability to accurately tap the third menu option in a row can be a bit challenging.", "But for essential functions like aircon, there a rotary dials and simply switches, which are appreciated - especially when top-line models in the line-up, like the flagship Q8, lack such physical controls in place of a haptic-feedback second infotainment display.", "Voice control is also on offer and works pretty well; think Siri levels of accuracy as opposed to Google Assistant.", "As expected with any new Audi, Apple CarPlay and Android Auto are integrated into the system, which is a neat touch - but far from essential given Audi's MMI system has more than enough functions for most people to get their teeth into.", "When it comes to entertainment, the Vorsprung Q3 sports a Bang & Olufsen 3D sound system; it's a £995 option for the Sport and S Line models.", "With 15 speakers, a 16-channel amplifier and kicking out 680 watts of audio power, the speakers deliver the very clean and crisp sound that B&O is known for.", "It's incredible - if you can plump for the pricier model or relevant speaker pack to have it added. With the speaker pack comes an extended ambient lighting pack, which offers coloured and contoured lighting through the car.", "It looks rather nice and again conveys that premium Audi feel.", "You'll have figured out by now that the Q3 is flush with options. And the lengthy list continues when it comes to the suite of safety and driver assistant tech the car can offer.", "As standard there's cruise control, lane change monitoring, rear parking sensors, and Audi's Pre-Sense collision-detection tech, all of which makes the task of day-to-day driving a bit less risky.", "But things get more interesting when options are added in. Go for the Vorsprung model and you'll get adaptive cruise control, a 360-degree camera for aiding challenging maneouvers, and an emergency assist feature that can detect when a driver is drifting out of a lane and, if cruise control is active, can safely stop the car if the driver doesn't respond to visual, acoustic and haptic warnings.", "Camera-based traffic sign recognition picks out important signs like speed limits and traffic warning and displays them on the instrument cluster and is a rather swish feature, while cross-traffic assistance warns the driver of traffic zipping behind them when they're reversing, applying the brakes if a collision is imminent.", "Probably the most interesting bit of kit is the parking assistant feature, which makes use of the sensor suite on the Q3, calculates the ideal parking path for slotting the car into a bay or when parallel parking, and then autonomously takes care of the steering while the driver controls the accelerator and brake.", "It's a long-way from self-driving but is a neat example of how some autonomous tech can be fitted into today's cars.", "Of course, for the lesser Q3 trims, these safety features come as £300-to-£800 extras. It also means there's the potential to have a lot of beeps and pop-up warnings nagging you about how you're driving; for keen drivers and petrolheads, such systems might be not be as desirable as they are to folks who want the latest in German car tech.", "Speaking of driving, that's arguably where the Q3 disappoints a little.", "There are a three petrol and two diesel engines options for the UK, with these ranging from the the 1.5-litre turbocharged 35 TFSI, which kicks out 148bhp, to the top-end 45 TFSI motor, which delivers 230bph.", "There's no electric or hybrid option, but the latter could pop up as 2019 chugs along.", "Depending on the engine, there are options for front-wheel drive or Audi's Quattro four-wheel drive system, and either a six-speed manual or the S tronic automatic gearbox.", "We got our hands on a fully-kitted out S Line model with the 45 TFSI engine. With a 0-62mph time of 6.3 seconds our Q3 was pretty nippy on paper, and when it got going it proved to be so on the road.", "But the S Tronic transmission saldy got in the way. At times it felt a bit slow on choosing the right gear and changing up too quickly when we wanted it to hold onto a lower gear for a little longer when tackling a mountain road.", "The steering suffered from a similar lack of dynamics. It is nice and precise with Audi's progressive steering becoming sharper as the steering angle increases - helpful when tackling twisty corners - but it is devoid of feel and feedback and still feels a bit light.", "The Q3 does win some points back when it comes to how stable it feels when tackling hills. With the sports suspension and Quattro setup of our S Line, there was little body roll when the car was driven around corners in enthusiastic fashion.", "When pushed with the gearbox being controlled by the paddles and not the car, we could really feel the Q3's stability and grip come into its own.", "While the Q3 looks aggressive and sporty, it really feels most suited for navigating A roads, pootling around scenic towns or cruising along dual carriageways.", "Sure there's some fun to be had in the corners and on B-roads, but it never really comes across as a car for driving enthusiasts.", "Which is fine, really, as it fits the bill for its target audience and looks great in doing so.", "The Q3 might not be a drivers' car, per se, but it does provide access to some of the best technology in the car world with the attention to detail and premium feel Audi has built its name on.", "It's such (often pricey) additions that make the Q3 feel special and well worthy of your attention."]}

new, many of our customers have difficulty accurately forecasting their product requirements and estimating the timing of their new product introductions, which ultimately affects their demand for our products.", "Historically, because of this limited visibility, actual results have been different from our forecasts of customer demand.", "Some of these differences have been material, leading to excess inventory or product shortages and revenue and margin forecasts above those we were actually able to achieve.", "These differences may occur in the future, and the adverse impact of these differences between forecasts and actual results could grow if we are successful in selling more products to some customers.", "In addition, the rapid pace of innovation in our industry could render significant portions of our inventory obsolete.", "inventory levels could result in unexpected expenses or increases in our reserves that could adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition.", "Conversely, if we were to underestimate customer demand or if sufficient manufacturing capacity were unavailable, we could forego revenue opportunities, potentially lose market

scarce engineering resources in pursuit of a single customer opportunity.", "We may not win the competitive selection process and may never generate any revenue despite incurring significant design and development expenditures.", "These risks are exacerbated by the fact that some of our customers’ products likely will have short life cycles.", "Failure to obtain a design win could prevent us from offering an entire generation of a product, even though this has not occurred to date.", "This could cause us to lose revenue and require us to write off obsolete inventory, and could weaken our position in future competitive selection processes.", "After securing a design win, we may experience delays in generating revenue from our products as a result of the lengthy development cycle typically required.", "Our customers generally take a considerable amount of time to evaluate our products. The typical time from early engagement by our sales force to actual product introduction runs from nine to twelve months for the consumer market, to as much as 36 months or more for the cable operator and telecommunications infrastructure markets, and beyond 36 months in the wired and wireless infrastructure markets.", "The delays inherent in these lengthy sales cycles increase the risk that a customer will decide to cancel, curtail, reduce or delay its product plans, causing us to lose anticipated sales.", "In addition, any delay or cancellation of a customer’s plans could materially and adversely affect our financial results, as we may have incurred significant expense and generated no revenue.", "Finally, our customers’ failure to successfully market and sell their products could reduce demand for our products and materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.", "If we were unable to generate revenue after incurring substantial expenses to develop any of our products, our business would suffer.", "Our operating results are subject to substantial quarterly and annual fluctuations and may fluctuate significantly due to a number of factors that could adversely affect our business and our stock price.", "Our revenue and operating results have fluctuated in the past and are likely to fluctuate in the future.", "These fluctuations may occur on a quarterly and on an annual basis and are due to a number of factors, many of which are beyond our control.", "• | changes in end-user demand for the products manufactured and sold by our customers; |", "• | the receipt, reduction or cancellation of significant orders by customers; |", "• | fluctuations in the levels of component inventories held by our customers; |", "• | market acceptance of our products and our customers’ products; |", "• | our ability to develop, introduce and market new products and technologies on a timely basis; |", "• | the timing and extent of product development costs; |", "• | new product announcements and introductions by us or our competitors; |", "• | incurrence of research and development and related new product expenditures; |", "• | seasonality or cyclical fluctuations in our markets; |", "• | significant warranty claims, including those not covered by our suppliers; |", "• | loss of key personnel or the shortage of available skilled workers; |", "• | impairment of long-lived assets, including masks and production equipment; and |", "• | the effects of competitive pricing pressures, including decreases in average selling prices of our products.", "These factors are difficult to forecast, and these, as well as other factors, could materially adversely affect our quarterly or annual operating results.", "We typically are required to incur substantial development costs in advance of a prospective sale with no certainty that we will ever recover these costs.", "A substantial amount of time may pass between a design win and the generation of revenue related to the expenses previously incurred, which can potentially cause our operating results to fluctuate significantly from period to period.", "In addition, a significant amount of our operating expenses are relatively fixed in nature due to our significant sales, research and development costs.", "Any failure to adjust spending quickly enough to compensate for a revenue shortfall could magnify its adverse impact on our results of operations.", "We are subject to the cyclical nature of the semiconductor industry.", "The semiconductor industry is highly cyclical and is characterized by constant and rapid technological change, rapid product obsolescence and price erosion, evolving standards, short product life cycles and wide fluctuations in product supply and demand.", "Any future downturns may result in diminished product demand, production overcapacity, high inventory levels and accelerated erosion of average selling prices.", "Furthermore, any upturn in the semiconductor industry could result in increased competition for access to third-party foundry and assembly capacity.", "We are dependent on the availability of this capacity to manufacture and assemble our all of our products.", "None of our third-party foundry or assembly contractors has provided assurances that adequate capacity will be available to us in the future.", "A significant downturn or upturn could have a material adverse effect on our business and operating results.", "The use of open source software in our products, processes and technology may expose us to additional risks and harm our intellectual property.", "Our products, processes and technology sometimes utilize and incorporate software that is subject to an open source license.", "Open source software is typically freely accessible, usable and modifiable.

The S&P 500 fell just over 10% over the course of 8 trading days, reaching a closing low of 2,582 on February 8th.", "Since then, we had one of the best 5-day stock market runs in years, at +5.8%. It was bigger than the rally after the election (3.8%) or the quick recovery after the Brexit vote (4.4%).", "This is not the first time equities quickly rebounded after a sell off but the catalyst for the dramatic move was less clear this time around.", "In the recent past, investors could point to some major event that stirred the markets. It was widely contended that the threat of rising interest rates were wearing on investors as well as large institutional investors winding down volatility trades all at once.", "Investors had become accustomed to consistent returns with little fanfare. Last year, U.S. stock markets experienced the least volatile year on record, hitting new highs seemingly every day.", "Then came the tax reform bill to end 2017 to boost the S&P 500 in January for a return of 5.6%.

Also in September, Intel completed its acquisition of assets from Via Telecom which should result in Intel bringing to market CDMA technology with its chipsets in the future.", "The LTE chipset supplier base continued to diversify in 2015. Companies such as Spreadtrum joined the LTE baseband fray with market leaders Qualcomm, MediaTek, and Samsung.", "With OEMs now having more options to fill their modem needs, market share concentration has reduced. In the low-end and mid-range market segments, a few OEMs which have been historically dependent on Qualcomm for their SoCs, such as HTC have introduced models using MediaTek platforms.", "In China, Xiaomi has turned to Leadcore to supply at least some of its Chinese smartphones such as the Redmi 2A. Xiaomi has reportedly also chosen Leadcore as a partner to develop its own custom smartphone SoC in the future.", "Other OEMs such as Samsung and Huawei (via its HiSilicon subsidiary) have internally produced smartphone ICs with which they have so far traditionally supported only some of their higher-end flagship devices.", "On the device level, LTE phones continue to move down the price curve as devices are available for well less than $100 from OEMs such as Microsoft, Samsung, LG, HTC, and others.", "Semiconductor supplier price competition for these low cost phones is likely to be the fiercest, as OEMs need to squeeze every cent from their bill of materials in these phones.", "IHS expects this market segment with an ASP less than $150 will represent about one third of the smartphone market globally in 2016, representing a significant volume opportunity to the most successful suppliers.", "A wide variation of digital baseband requirements creates a sizable moat for new entrants in the LTE baseband segment who face daunting challenges to overcome, including well-established market leaders with bleeding edge technology and IP.", "Qualcomm is the market leader in terms of revenue from LTE baseband and unit shipments. It’s now had several generations of commercially available LTE modem and has both integrated and discrete design options with products targeted across all smartphone tiers from entry-level to high-end.", "Conversely, new entrants have typically introduced products that aren’t on the bleeding edge and aimed at entry level devices or geared toward specific regions.", "For instance Spreadtrum’s first category 4 LTE SoC started shipping in April last year, and other companies’ offerings are also currently confined Cat4 LTE solutions, capable of 150Mbps on the downlink.", "In comparison, the market leader is now offering Cat16/13 LTE solutions which offer up to 1 Gbps in the downlink, featuring higher orders of carrier aggregation.", "Importantly, speed on the uplink is also improved from 50 Mbps in Cat4 devices to 150Mbps in the uplink with Cat13.", "As more high-end phones offer 4K video recording and advanced camera capabilities, any increase in uplink speed (or lack of) will become more noticeable to end-users, especially as mobile networks advance and user generated content is increasingly posted to social networks or cloud services.", "Network operators across the globe continue to engage in the development of Category 6 (Cat6) and above LTE Advanced (LTE-A) networks.", "According to the Global Mobile Suppliers Organization (GSA), as of January 2016 there were over 116 commercial LTE advanced networks, over 80 of which were capable of supporting at least Cat6 LTE.", "As this technology becomes more widespread, a larger number of OEMs are adopting it in their handsets even in the mid-range market segment.", "Suppliers that are able to offer competitive offerings with Cat6, Cat9, and higher capabilities will be well positioned for future smartphone design wins in the mid-range and high-end market segments.", "As mobile networks advance and Wi-Fi has become ubiquitous in most developed markets, users now expect seamless data connectivity to meet their rigorous demands.", "Moving forward as technologies like voice-over-LTE (VoLTE) are increasingly adopted and Wi-Fi calling becomes more pervasive; the level at which modems can offer seamless interoperability between LTE and Wi-Fi is becoming another key differentiator between current market leaders and new entrants.", "Suppliers that can offer the smoothest most consistent handoff between Wi-Fi and LTE will be best positioned to address the technologies coexistence.", "Low power consumption is another characteristic which successful modem portfolios must offer, regardless of target market segment.", "One way of achieving superior power consumption is by moving modems to smaller semiconductor technology nodes.", "Currently, leading suppliers are offering 14/16nm applications processors with modems following suit in 2016.", "Some baseband suppliers also offer power management solutions for the RF front-end (the functional area between the transceiver and the antenna), providing further relief for mounting battery life demands.", "Integrated solutions offer benefits to OEMs and suppliers alike", "The overall design trend in the smartphone market is a shift from discrete or “thin” modems to integrated modem-application processors (Mod+APs).", "While certain OEMs such as Apple and Samsung have used thin-modems extensively in their flagship phones, those designs are increasingly the exception rather than the rule.", "Suppliers will typically favor selling Mod+APs as they offer better revenue opportunities and provide better profit margin than thin-modems.", "Selling a Mod+AP as opposed to a thin modem will typically lead to greater opportunities for sales of other components such as WLAN ICs, audio codecs, RF components, and power management ICs, as attach rates of these supporting ICs tend to be much higher with integrated solutions.", "Some OEMs may elect to utilize Mod+AP, benefiting from reduced design resource requirements and potentially faster development cycles, as well as reduced BOM cost of some functions such as WLAN/Bluetooth connectivity.", "Modem suppliers have been integrating the WLAN baseband functionality into the main SoC of a smartphone and pairing that with a companion IC which addresses the WLAN RF functionality.", "MediaTek, Qualcomm, and Spreadtrum are all using this approach, with varying degrees of success. The WLAN companion IC approach is particularly attractive to entry level and mid-range smartphone designs from a BOM perspective.", "However, in many premium focused smartphones OEMs are choosing to stay with discrete WLAN/Bluetooth solutions such as those from Broadcom.", "The incorporation of WLAN into main smartphone SoCs has helped to soften Broadcom’s dominance of the overall WLAN IC market in recent years.", "As vertically integrated OEMs such as Huawei and Samsung continue to develop their own modem solutions third party suppliers may find revenue from these OEMs harder to come by.", "For instance, at the end of its fiscal year in 2013 Qualcomm cited Samsung as a greater than 10% customer, due in large part to their extensive use of Qualcomm’s solutions for its handsets.", "However, over the past year Samsung increasingly relied upon its own Shannon modems in many smartphone models.", "In November Samsung announced the Exynos 8890 which should be the first internally developed integrated modem to become widely used in Samsung’s smartphones.", "As this follows the greater trend toward the use of integrated modems in the smartphone market, it could signal even less reliance on Qualcomm in the future, though network interoperability may keep the company from being completely shut out.", "It’s important to note however, that Samsung will often have design teams compete internally using different approaches or components and may choose a third-party IC in one design cycle while opting for Exynos in the next.", "Therefore, the last design loss is not necessarily a harbinger of decline for Qualcomm as they have as good of chance or better with the next design.", "Huawei, through its Hisilicon subsidiary, is also leaning on internally developed baseband products. In 2015 the company used its own integrated modem in the Kirin 930 which was found in high-end phones such as the P8.", "Last fall the company announced the Kirin 950 which represents further progress for its internally developed modem line.", "The Kirin 950 is the company’s third generation Mod+AP which boasts improved power consumption and performance relative to the Kirin 930.", "The 16nm SoC uses ARMs big.
