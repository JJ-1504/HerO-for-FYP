Utility solar also saw slight annual contraction, due to the impacts of Section 201 tariff uncertainty earlier in the year and shifting project timelines based on the tariff schedule.", "Overall, in 2018, solar PV has accounted for 29% of new electricity generating capacity additions – a lower share compared to 2017 due to a surge in new natural-gas plants in early 2018.", "After experiencing volume contraction last year, the residential solar market regained its footing in 2018 with steadily increasing installation volumes.", "The fourth quarter of 2018 was the largest quarter for the residential segment in two years. Five quarters of modest growth now suggest the market is adopting a more sustainable growth profile with a mix of local and regional installers operating alongside national installers.", "With 2018 in the books, a few key themes have emerged about the state of the residential solar market.", "Installation growth and market penetration levels suggest major states have moved past early adopters.", "Among the highest-penetration markets in the nation, residential growth rates were mixed in 2018. The one exception to this was Nevada, which experienced 3x growth once net metering was reinstated in 2017 after being revoked in 2016, which caused the market to contract by 61% from 2016 to 2017.This political turmoil led to abnormally high installations in 2018 based on pent-up demand.", "Outside the stabilizing large markets, growth in low-penetration emerging markets, such as Texas and Florida, continues to add to the geographic diversity of the residential market outside of California and the Northeast.", "Legacy markets are no longer the primary engines of growth. Though California is forecasted to be the largest market for the foreseeable future due to the sheer size of the state, the regional growth landscape began to shift and diversify in 2018.", "Of the top 10 markets in 2017, six markets experienced annual contraction in 2018 while two experienced double-digit percentage growth.", "Meanwhile, a handful of states are leapfrogging developed markets. Both Texas and Florida saw installations that surpassed legacy markets Maryland and Massachusetts last year, signaling new state-level leadership on residential solar development.", "In 2018, we saw a pivot away from legacy, incentive-driven markets and the emergence of low-penetration markets with limited third-party ownership options, good PV resources, and low electricity rates – a trend we expect to continue.", "Residential PV continues to be constrained by high costs of customer acquisition. Outside of overhead and margin, customer-acquisition costs remain the highest expense for installers of all sizes averaging 20% of the total system pricing.", "This reaffirms our view that at existing prices, sales and marketing is a vital part of continued residential market development.", "High customer-acquisition costs are directly related to high overall cost of installation, which also suggests a virtuous cycle of reduced costs.", "One target area for the industry to reduce costs is through streamlining the permitting and inspection processes, as permitting delays lead to customer attrition and other expenses.", "SEIA and the Solar Foundation, along with numerous companies, are working together to address these issues.", "New construction and roof replacement markets also represent an opportunity to address both customer-acquisition and permitting costs.", "However, at existing price levels, the high cost of customer-acquisition will slow growth in the near-term.", "Incentives and net metering remain important market enablers but show diminishing rates of return. While utility attempts to roll back net metering have been an issue in years past, this was not the case in 2018.", "No substantial revisions were made to residential NEM values in 2018 other than in Connecticut. In prior years, impending changes to NEM, other state-level incentives, or rate structures have created demand pull-in.", "Despite anticipated changes to incentives and NEM in 2019-2020, the major Northeast markets collectively saw no growth in installation volumes.", "This suggests that while changes to NEM policy and other incentives have greatly impacted growth in years past, 2018 marks a year of market maturation.", "While strong NEM policy remains an essential foundation for rooftop solar adoption, future growth across legacy markets will require technology and business-model innovation to tap into new customer demographics.", "Meanwhile, California’s new home solar mandate may signal the next phase of solar market adoption. The California Energy Commission’s decision in early 2018 to require solar PV on all new homes beginning in 2020 significantly insulates our long-term forecasts by adding an additional gigawatt of residential demand from 2020-2024E. While it remains to be seen whether other states will follow suit, some municipalities have created solar mandates for new buildings.", "Meanwhile, major national installers are spending considerable resources building relationships with housing developers to comply with California’s mandate while also aiming to capitalize on one-off housing developments outside of state mandates.", "With several newly announced entrants into the space, new home solar, whether mandated or voluntary, could provide an opportunity to bridge the cost of customer acquisition gap that has constrained growth.", "Unlike the case of residential PV, a handful of state-specific regulatory cliffs and policy reforms took effect in 2018, which led to a decline in non-residential build-out in the major markets of California and Massachusetts.", "Despite California’s market falling 17% year-over-year, the decline was not as severe as previously anticipated, as the extent of California’s pipeline of projects grandfathered in under solar-friendly time-of-use rates has been higher than previously assumed.", "However, Massachusetts witnessed 64% year-over-year decline in capacity installed as the industry awaited the start of the Solar Massachusetts Renewable Target (SMART) program.", "Combined, these two states saw a year-over-year decrease of more than 450 MW of installed non-residential PV capacity.", "New York bucked the national trend, experiencing record installations in 2018. This was the result of a waning pipeline of grandfathered remote net-metering projects becoming interconnected, despite being constructed in 2017.", "Meanwhile, community solar continues to support non-residential PV. Minnesota and Massachusetts contributed to well over 500 MW of community solar being installed this year.", "And while we won’t begin to see projects from New Jersey’s new community solar program until late 2019 at the earliest, the state is making significant strides in establishing the program, which technically kicks off in Q1 2019.", "Utility PV continues to hold the largest share of annual installations in the U.S. solar market with a total of 6.2 GWdc in 2018, accounting for 58% of total U.S. annual capacity additions.", "Lower-than-expected installation volumes in Q4 are primarily attributed to Section 201 module tariffs set in January 2018 and implemented in February 2018, which caused project sponsors to reassess a handful of project timelines and push out target commercial operation dates (CODs) from 2018 into 2019.", "In addition to tariff-related delays, interconnection delays for PURPA projects in the Carolinas contributed to lower-than-expected Q4 deployments.", "U.S. utility solar procurement has grown considerably with a number of utilities, such as Hawaiian Electric Company and Entergy Mississippi, announcing plans to add more utility PV to their generation portfolios due to the pure economic competitiveness of solar.", "In 2018, 13.2 GWdc of utility solar PPAs were signed, driving the contracted pipeline to 28.3 GWdc – the highest point in the history of U.S. solar.", "Most of these PPAs will be fulfilled with products imported after significant declines in the Section 201 tariffs.", "Voluntary procurement remains the largest driver of new PPAs signed and is expected to drive 51% of 2019 capacity additions.", "While commercial and industrial (C&I) off takers only accounted for 153 MW of actual capacity additions in 2018, C&I procurement drove 21% of all new PPAs signed last year.", "Meanwhile, new renewable portfolio standards are poised to drive additional utility PV.", "Many utility PV projects suffered disruption, delay and even cancelation due to the uncertainty leading up to the imposition of the Section 201 tariffs.", "The impacts can be seen in the volume of installations in 2018, which were down 7% year-over-year for utility-scale PV.", "However, since the tariffs were announced, the industry has pushed out timelines to account for the tariff stepdown schedule and has benefited from faster-than-expected declines in global module pricing.", "These price declines are mostly due to changes in China’s feed-in tariff policy that has resulted in a supply glut.", "While the Section 201 tariffs are still imposing a significant opportunity cost on the U.S. solar industry, new project procurement is moving forward thanks to strong industry fundamentals.", "Cell and module tariffs dropped from 30% to 25% in February 2019. Tariffs will drop to 20% in February 2020 and 15% in February 2021 before their scheduled expiration in February 2022.", "The International Trade Commission (ITC) will conduct a mid-term review of the tariffs starting in January 2020, at which point the President will have the opportunity to continue, modify, or terminate the tariffs.", "The ITC will begin data collection for that review this summer.", "Residential installation growth exceeded expectations for 2018, largely thanks to strong showings in California, Nevada and Florida.", "Still, as major state markets continue to grow past early-adopter consumers, higher costs of customer acquisition will challenge the industry to innovate.", "Long-term growth prospects benefit from (among other factors): geographic diversification outside of legacy state markets, California’s new home solar mandate, new incentive programs such as Illinois’ Adjustable Block Program, and technological/business model innovation to improve product offerings into solar-plus-storage.", "In 2018, the non-residential sector benefited from a large pipeline of projects grandfathered in under more favorable compensation policies in California and Massachusetts.", "California experienced commercial solar build-out in 2018, stemming from developers rushing to install projects to meet a (since-lifted) deadline to be grandfathered in under solar-friendly time-of-use rates.", "Meanwhile, New York saw its largest year ever for commercial installations as the remaining pipeline of remote net-metering projects came online.", "However, the delayed opening of the SMART program in Massachusetts resulted in that state seeing 325 MW less capacity installed in 2018 than in the record-breaking 2017.", "Additionally, the build-out of Xcel Energy’s robust community solar pipeline in Minnesota still accounts for a significant share of non-residential growth, with nearly 300 MWdc added in 2018.", "In total, Minnesota accounted for over 80% of the community solar build-out in 2018, while Massachusetts accounted for much of the remainder.", "Though the community solar market didn’t quite outpace 2017 capacity, last year marked the second consecutive year of over 500 MW of community solar installed.", "Utility PV continues to hold the largest share of annual installations in the U.S. solar market. In Q4 2018, 3.0 GWdc of utility PV capacity came online boosting the annual total to 6.2 GWdc in 2018.", "These additions represented 72% of total Q4 capacity and 58% of total U.S. capacity additions for the year.", "Lower-than-expected installation volumes in Q4 can be primarily attributed to two factors. The module tariffs set in January 2018 caused a handful of projects to reassess project timelines and push out target completed operation dates (CODs) from 2018 into 2019.", "Additionally, a handful of PURPA projects in the Carolinas have faced interconnection delays or have been outright canceled as utilities push back against standard rate agreements.", "U.S. utility solar market procurement has grown considerably, largely set for years when tariffs have decreased.", "Many utilities like Tennessee Valley Authority, Georgia Power and Northern Indiana Public Service Co., have announced plans to add more utility PV to their generation portfolios.", "With 13.2 GWdc of utility solar PPAs signed in 2018, the contracted pipeline peaked in Q3 2018 at 25.3 GWdc, the highest in the history of U.S. solar, and declined slightly in Q4 as project completion outpaced new PPAs signed.", "We employ a bottom-up modeling methodology to track and report national average PV system pricing for the major market segments.", "This methodology is based on tracked wholesale pricing of major solar components and data collected from interviews with major installers.", "Note: Detailed information about national system prices by market segment and component is available in the full report.", "In Q4 2018, system pricing fell in all market segments. Quarter-over-quarter, system pricing fell by 1.3%, 1.1%, 3.3% and 3.9% in the residential, non-residential, utility fixed-tilt and utility single-axis tracking markets, respectively.", "Prices across market segments are now all at historic lows despite tariffs on modules, inverters, aluminum and steel: $2.98/Wdc, $1.51/Wdc, $0.93/Wdc and $1.04/Wdc for residential, non-residential, utility fixed-tilt and utility single-axis tracking systems, respectively.", "Year-over-year system pricing fell by 4%, 8.5%, 15.1% and 14.4% in the residential, non-residential, utility fixed-tilt and utility single-axis tracking markets, respectively.", "Price declines continue to be led by declining hardware costs, with much of the reduction coming in module pricing.", "Cuts to demand in China last June created global module over-supply conditions that led to lower module prices, somewhat mitigating the impacts of module tariffs in the U.S.", "The tariffs still, however, impose an opportunity cost on the U.S. industry, which cannot fully take advantage of pricing available to the rest of the world.", "After modest decline in 2018, the national solar PV market will resume growth in 2019-2020, primarily driven by continued growth in the residential segment and a rebound in the utility PV sector.", "For utility PV, the downside to our 2018 forecasts benefits 2019 – the 2019 forecast has been increased from 7.2 GWdc to 7.8 GWdc as projects have pushed out target completion dates, and 2.1 GWdc of capacity is already under construction.", "The forecasts for 2020 and 2021 have increased to 10 and 10.4 GWdc, respectively. Of the projects announced in 2019, 68% have 2020 or 2021 target CODs, significantly boosting confidence in the near-term forecast.", "And we expect to see at least half of 2023 capacity additions leverage a 22% or higher ITC. Finally, growth will continue into 2024, driven by current utility IRPs for solar capacity along with the economic fundamentals of utility solar projects.", "After examining the risks of advanced procurement, many project developers now seem more open to anchoring projects in 2019 to claim the 30% ITC and bringing them online in 2021 or later.", "Still, several developers have suggested they will assess each project on a case-by-case basis.", "Commercial and industrial procurement is expected to remain a strong driver of utility solar over the next several years as the number of companies pledging to meet 100% renewables or zero-carbon targets increases.", "Renewable portfolio standards (RPSs) are also poised to see a resurgence as a driver of utility PV. Many of the newly elected governors are in states that have joined the U.S. Climate Alliance or campaigned on a pledge to join the Alliance and commit to the Paris Agreement in lieu of federal participation.", "Six of the governors have proposed increases to RPS targets, while three (Colorado, Nevada, and Illinois) have proposed 100% RPS mandates.", "This is in addition to California’s 100% RPS, Hawaii’s 100% RPS, and New York’s 50% RPS. If all states where elected governors campaigned on RPS increases were to achieve 50% RPS compliance by 2030, it could drive up to 37.0 GWdc of additional solar.", "Wood Mackenzie’s utility PV five-year forecast has increased 2.3 GWdc since our last report as more projects are announced, utilities include more solar in long-term resource planning, and development is driven increasingly by C&I offtakers.", "For residential PV, after seeing 7% growth in 2018, we expect flat to tempered growth in 2019, primarily due to major market maturation resulting in limited long-term growth opportunities in major Northeast markets.", "Meanwhile, the approval of a super off-peak rate in Southern California Edison territory – the second-largest utility in the nation for solar PV – takes effect in 2019, which severely limits the economic attractiveness of solar-only products.", "That said, growth resumes in 2020-2021 as the ITC step-down is expected to pull in demand in both legacy and emerging markets before declining in 2022.", "Growth resumes in 2023 and continues into 2024 based on economic fundamentals as the market adjusts to the post-ITC reality.", "In the long-term, residential capacity growth will be driven by California’s new home solar mandate – with upside potential from other states adopting similar mandates – a robust incentive program in Illinois, emerging markets like Texas and Florida becoming the new engines of retrofit growth, and the proliferation of solar-plus-storage.", "Meanwhile, the non-residential PV market is on track for another down year as the segment acclimates to a reduced incentive environment across major state markets in 2019.", "However, this will be incrementally offset starting in 2020 as the next wave of states with robust community solar mandates – New York, Maryland, Illinois and New Jersey – begin to see the realization of those pipelines.", "Increasing solar-plus-storage viability will also begin to have an impact on non-residential demand.", "By 2023, roughly 30% of non-residential PV will come from community solar, and ~20% will come from solar-plus-storage projects.", "By 2020, 28 states in the U.S. are expected to have 100+ MWdc annual solar markets, with 25 of those states being home to more than 1 GWdc of operating solar PV.", "This compares to only two states with 100+ MWdc annual solar markets in 2010.", "Forecast details by state (43 states plus Washington, D.C.) and market segment through 2024 are available in the full report.", "U.S. solar market insightÂ® is a quarterly publication of Wood Mackenzie Power & Renewables, Inc. d/b/a Greentech Media and the Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA)Â®.", "Each quarter, we collect granular data on the U.S. solar market from nearly 200 utilities, state agencies, installers and manufacturers.", "This data provides the backbone of this U.S. solar market insightÂ® report, in which we identify and analyze trends in U.S. solar demand, manufacturing and pricing by state and market segment.", "We also use this analysis to look forward and forecast demand over the next five years.

Released June 18, 2019", "In Q1 2019, the U.S. solar market installed 2.7 gigawatts direct current (GWdc) of solar photovoltaic (PV) capacity, a 10% increase year-over-year and the strongest Q1 in the industry’s history.", "After a year in which the residential sector grew 8%, the rebound continued, with the sector experiencing a third consecutive quarter with more than 600 MWdc added.", "Conversely, non-residential PV suffered both quarterly and annual declines due to policy transitions and interconnection issues in key markets.", "The quarter was buoyed by 1.6 GW of utility-scale installations, with new project procurement growing the contracted pipeline to nearly 28 GW.", "Across all market segments, solar PV accounted for 51% of all new electricity generating capacity additions in Q1 2019.", "Further, solar surpassed the 2 million installation milestone in Q1 2019, after reaching the first million just three years ago in 2016.", "After growing 8 percent in 2018, the residential solar market grew 5% on a year-over-year basis and is effectively tied for the second-largest quarter since Q4 2016.", "Since bottoming out in Q3 2017, quarterly growth in five of the last six quarters suggests that the market is adopting a more sustainable growth profile, with a mix of local and regional installers operating alongside national installers.", "However, state markets with higher penetration levels and increasing customer-acquisition costs continue to struggle with flat or declining installations on a quarterly basis.", "The continued emergence of new markets has helped to sustain robust installation volumes nationally.", "Unlike the residential market, a handful of state-specific regulatory cliffs and policy reforms that took effect in 2018 continued to impact non-residential installations in Q1 2019.", "Major policy reforms in the core non-residential markets of California and Massachusetts are still hampering development.", "In the case of California, installations were flat on both a year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter basis, which suggests that installation declines stemming from the transition to new time-of-use rates may be abating.", "Massachusetts is still being negatively impacted by the transition to its new incentive program, which has slowed most non-residential development.", "As the state transitions to the new SMART program, utility interconnection approvals for qualified projects are taking much longer than anticipated, leaving most projects waiting months, if not years, to interconnect and begin earning SMART tariff revenue.", "This has resulted in market declines on both a year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter basis.", "Utility PV maintained the largest share of installations in the U.S. solar market this quarter – 1.6 GWdc of utility PV capacity came online in Q1 2019, representing 61% of quarterly capacity additions.", "With 4.7 GWdc of projects under construction, 2019 is on track to be a strong year for utility PV, with 46% growth over 2018 expected.", "After a record 15.0 GWdc of U.S. utility solar was procured in 2018, new project announcements have slowed slightly in 2019 but levels still remain healthy.", "As of May 2019, 3.8 GW have been procured, pushing the contracted pipeline to 27.7 GW. The growth is primarily due to a 1.5 GWdc announcement from Florida Power & Light and 1.1 GWdc announced by Duke Energy in the Carolinas.", "Florida Power & Light’s development of its own solar projects makes up the bulk of Florida’s five-year forecast, with additional announcements from Duke Florida, Teco Energy and Jacksonville Electric expected to add to the pipeline in that state.", "Voluntary procurement of utility PV based on its economic competitiveness continues to be the primary driver of projects announced in 2019.", "While many states, utilities and cities have announced or proposed 50% or 100% renewable energy or zero-carbon standards, the announcements have not yet resulted in an uptick in RPS-driven procurement.", "Corporate procurement of utility solar drove 22% of projects announced in 2018 and continues apace in 2019, with 14% of projects announced having a corporate offtaker.", "(Wood Mackenzie classifies large offsite projects with C&I offtakers as utility-scale rather than distributed due to the size and structure of the deals.)", "As the number of corporations pledging to use 100% renewable power continues to grow, corporate procurement is expected to remain a strong driver of utility PV.", "Despite steady installations in Q1 2019, the residential market is still highly reliant on legacy state markets, such as California and the Northeast, which have seen only modest to flat growth over the past several quarters.", "As these major state markets continue to grow past early-adopter consumers, higher costs of customer acquisition will challenge the industry to innovate product offerings and diversify geographically.", "Indeed, 29% of residential capacity in Q1 2019 came from markets outside the top 10 (by cumulative capacity), the highest share for emerging markets in industry history.", "From 2019-2021, residential growth will range from 5%-20% due to both emerging markets with strong resource fundamentals like Florida and Texas, and markets where recent policy developments have increased our near-term forecasts.", "Maryland’s recent renewable portfolio standard increase, the removal of South Carolina’s net metering cap, and new incentive programs such as Illinois’ Adjustable Block Program will provide significant upside and growth to our residential forecasts over the next few years.", "Meanwhile, California’s new home solar mandate will also help to offset market penetration challenges beginning in 2020.", "In the long term, the ITC step-down is expected to pull in demand in both legacy and emerging markets before declining in 2022.", "Growth resumes in 2023 and continues into 2024 based on economic fundamentals as the market adjusts to post-ITC market conditions.", "That said, long-term growth in a post-ITC world will be contingent on geographic diversification outside of legacy state markets and technological/business-model innovation to improve product offerings in solar-plus-storage.", "Non-residential installation totals in Q1 2019 were the weakest since Q1 2017 as all three major state markets (California, Massachusetts and Minnesota) saw declining volumes due to state-level policy reforms and interconnection delays that continue to limit development opportunities.", "Overall, the non-residential PV market is on track for another down year as the segment acclimates to a reduced incentive environment across major state markets.", "However, this will be incrementally offset starting in 2020 as the next wave of states with robust community solar mandates – New York, Maryland, Illinois and New Jersey – experience growth.", "Furthermore, recent policy developments in New York and Maryland will ultimately provide for growth in our long-term outlook.", "Significant revisions to the Value of Distributed Energy Resources (VDER) docket in New York have bolstered our long-term forecasts for both commercial and community solar, while an RPS increase in Maryland will boost the sagging SREC market to the benefit of the entire non-residential segment.", "Increasing solar-plus-storage viability will also begin to have an impact on non-residential demand as policymakers and business leaders increasingly consider energy storage in their decisions.", "New York’s recent development of the Bridge Incentive increases our long-term solar-plus-storage forecasts with further potential upside.", "By 2023, roughly 30% of total non-residential PV will come from community solar, and ~20% will come from solar-plus-storage projects.", "The U.S. utility solar forecast for 2019-2024 has grown by 5.1 GWdc since last quarter. The largest contributor is an increase to Florida’s five-year outlook from 6.0 GWdc to 9.0 GWdc due to new solar procurement by Florida Power & Light (FPL), Duke Energy Florida, and other Florida utilities (most of which is utility self-build).", "This positions Florida to be the top state for utility PV over the next six years.", "Since last quarter, the 2019 forecast has grown by 1.2 GW, due largely to late project announcements in Texas that raised the state’s forecast by 720 MWdc.", "While the forecast for 2020 saw little change to overall expected capacity additions, over 10.0 GWdc of utility PV are still expected to come online that year.", "From 2021-2023, our utility PV forecast has increased by 2.8 GWdc. While the bulk of this increase is found in Florida, there are a growing number of utilities such as Xcel Energy, Idaho Power and PacifiCorp, among others, announcing additional solar procurement, expedited coal plant retirement, or plans to achieve 50% to 100% renewable or carbon-free energy targets, all of which have boosted the midterm forecast.", "During this time, utility PV also becomes increasingly competitive with wind. As the wind-focused federal Production Tax Credit steps down, solar begins to fall below the cost of wind on a levelized cost of energy (LCOE) basis in many traditional wind states such as Illinois, Iowa, Kansas, Michigan and the Dakotas by the mid-2020s.", "(Wood Mackenzie’s LCOE calculations for solar take the ITC incentive into account.) This is likely not only to drive more solar procurement in wind-dominant regions of Midcontinent Independent System Operator and Southwest Power Pool, but also to make solar the preferred renewable technology for corporate offtakers.", "Oklahoma Gas & Electric’s recent RFP for solar-plus-storage is the first example of what is likely to be a trend in solar procurement in the Prairies and Midwest.", "Our 2024 forecast has also increased by 1.1 GWdc. Many utilities such as Dominion, Tennessee Valley Authority and FPL have outlined solar procurement plans for 2024 and beyond.", "Despite the ITC having fully stepped down to 10% by that time, utility PV will remain economically competitive with new-build wind and natural gas in many places.", "We employ a bottom-up modeling methodology to track and report national average PV system pricing for the major market segments.", "This methodology is based on tracked wholesale pricing of major solar components and data collected from interviews with major installers.", "In Q1 2019, system pricing fell in all market segments. System pricing fell by 3.0%, 2.7%, 0.1% and 0.1% in the residential, non-residential, utility fixed-tilt and utility single-axis tracking markets, respectively.", "Prices across market segments are now all at historic lows despite tariffs on modules, inverters, aluminum and steel: $2.89/Wdc, $1.47/Wdc, $0.93/Wdc and $1.04/Wdc for residential, non-residential, utility fixed-tilt and utility single-axis tracking systems, respectively.", "Year-over-year system pricing fell by 6.8%, 9.8%, 12.6% and 12.9% in the residential, non-residential, utility fixed-tilt and utility single-axis tracking markets, respectively.", "U.S. solar market insightÂ® is a quarterly publication of Wood Mackenzie Power & Renewables, Inc. d/b/a Greentech Media and the Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA)Â®.", "Each quarter, we collect granular data on the U.S. solar market from nearly 200 utilities, state agencies, installers and manufacturers.", "This data provides the backbone of this U.S. solar market insightÂ® report, in which we identify and analyze trends in U.S. solar demand, manufacturing and pricing by state and market segment.", "We also use this analysis to look forward and forecast demand over the next five years. All forecasts are from Wood Mackenzie, Limited; SEIA does not predict future pricing, bid terms, costs, deployment or supply.", "Our coverage in these reports includes 43 individual states and Washington, D.C. However, the national totals reported include all 50 states, Washington, D.C. and Puerto Rico.", "The U.S. solar market insightÂ® is offered in two versions – the Executive Summary and the Full Report.", "The Executive Summary is free, and the Full Report is available individually each quarter or as part of an annual subscription.", "Detailed data and forecasts by state are available in the Full Report. To find out more, click here.", "Note on U.S. solar market insight report title: WM P&R and SEIA have changed the naming convention for the U.S. solar market insight report series.", "Starting with the report released in June 2016 onward, the report title will reference the quarter in which the report is released, as opposed to the most recent quarter in which installation figures are tracked.", "The exception will be our year in review publication, which covers the preceding year’s installation volumes despite being released during the first quarter of the current year."]}

According to Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA), the market added over 1.7 GW of capacity to reach a nationwide installation of 60 GW as of Q3 2018.", "Wind energy continues its strong growth in the United States as well. In 2018, the wind industry had added over 1.6 GW of capacity for the year at the end of Q3.", "In total, the United States now hosts close to 90 GW of wind energy.", "As prices continue to fall, potential solar projects are now possible across the country, according to Lazard.", "Policy initiatives, though, vary greatly depending on the geographic location of these projects.", "“A lot of energy-market decisions happen at the state level,” said Jennifer Helfrich, manager of state policy at Ceres.", "“The federal level has the power to push for larger initiatives such as the Obama-era Clean Power Plan.", "However… the state policy opportunity is much larger.”", "Colorado Begins an Ambitious Effort to Introduce New Power Sources", "“The midterms were good news in some ways and didn’t change the game that much in other places,” Helfrich said.", "“Colorado is a good example. Governor Polis is one of five governors who ran on a 100-percent-renewable energy platform.", "This is the first time in the history of our nation that governors have used that in their campaigning.”", "Of the newly inaugurated governors, Polis may have the most ambitious goal for his state. Polis has called for 100 percent of Colorado’s energy to come from renewable resources by 2040.", "According to the Energy Information Agency, around 20 percent of the state’s electricity generation came from renewable energy resources in 2016.", "In terms of current policy, Colorado has local rebates for solar power and tax exemptions for renewable energy.", "According to Ceres, transportation is one area Polis will focus on in the year ahead. The Colorado Department of Transportation predicts that, by 2020, Colorado’s transportation sector will account for 33 percent of the state’s greenhouse gas emissions.", "Currently, Colorado has a Low-Emission Vehicle Standard that reduces greenhouse gas emissions and smog-forming pollutants from passenger vehicles.", "As a next step, Colorado is looking into adopting a Zero Emissions Vehicle (ZEV) program which would require approximately 7 percent of new vehicle sales in the state be electric vehicles by 2025.", "Helfrich said one of Polis’s first acts as governor was an executive order mandating that Colorado’s Air Quality Control Commission move forward on the consideration of the ZEV program by this May.", "This would allow Colorado to take the lead on capturing the economic-development potential of electric vehicles.", "This objective would include a wide range of benefits. First, cost savings would accrue for businesses and consumers on fuel and maintenance.", "Second, the development of the electric vehicle supply chain would accelerate, bringing jobs in manufacturing.", "Third, the installation and management of charging infrastructure would catalyze development.", "This is a change Ceres staff say will help the state reduce emissions. It is also a move that many of Ceres’s corporate partners are saying will lead to economic opportunity for the business community.", "While Polis has said the 100-percent-renewable goal by 2040 is “aspirational,” there have been some key recent moves that could make it a reality.", "Most prominently, Xcel Energy, the state’s major utility, became the first utility to announce a plan to become carbon-neutral by 2050.", "Helfrich said this Colorado move is “unique.” This is not just because Xcel Energy’s plan would help the state recalibrate its energy portfolio towards more renewable energy.", "Xcel Energy’s Colorado Energy Plan would also lead to the early retirement of two coal plants. This would result in paying off the loss of those plants early.", "This was made possible by the fact that Xcel Energy had received record low bids on renewable energy and energy storage projects, Helfrich said.", "These clean energy resources were so affordable that it was cheaper for the utility to build in more clean energy from scratch than to continue operating the two coal plants it now plans to retire.", "The cost-effectiveness of these renewable energy and energy storage projects shows how the economics of clean energy are shifting across the country.", "New Mexico Has Scarce Solar Incentives but Plentiful Solar Opportunities", "According to National Renewable Energy Laboratory, New Mexico ranks second in solar statewide annual average irradiance in the United States.", "This suggests that New Mexico would be a prime market for market expansion.", "“Governor Lujan Grisham feels strongly that we can’t currently rely on the federal government,” said Nora Sackett, a spokeswoman for the governor.", "“States should lead the charge in fighting climate change and implementing clean energy policy – and as such, it’s an important part of her platform.”", "Policy-wise, there’s a lot of work to be done. While New Mexico offers a property-tax exemption for solar energy and net metering, there is little being done to use that solar irradiance.", "Work needs to be done to incentivize developers to bring additional solar projects to the state.", "During her campaign, Michelle Lujan Grisham said New Mexico should become a leader in clean energy. Currently, the state has about 777 MW of solar energy installed, according to SEIA.", "Sackett said Lujan Grisham will have a few clean energy-policy priorities. She has said she hopes to raise New Mexico’s Renewable Portfolio Standard to 50 percent by 2030 and 80 percent by 2040.", "In addition, the administration has said it hopes to invest in transmission infrastructure and explore interstate energy markets.", "The governor also wants to have the state export to high-demand markets like Arizona and California.", "During Lujan Grisham’s State of the State Address, she also committed to a methane-mitigation rule. She also said the state will join the U.S. Climate Alliance to show New Mexico’s commitment to climate and energy goals.", "“Governor Lujan Grisham is committed to making New Mexico a leader in clean energy across the board,” Sackett said.", "“This includes investing in clean energy infrastructure like wind and solar, raising the Renewable Portfolio Standard, growing the green jobs workforce in New Mexico with specific education and training programs, and implementing methane mitigation.”", "Kansas Has a Small Renewable Energy Base but an Interesting Political Dynamic", "When Governor Laura Kelly took office in early January, she inherited a state with perhaps one of the most interesting energy mixes in the country.", "According to the Kansas Corporation Commission (KCC), which oversees utility regulation in the state, half of the state’s electricity was powered by coal resources in 2017.", "The second highest power source is wind energy, which makes up nearly one-third of all the state’s electricity generation.", "The Energy Information Administration noted that Kansas is leading the charge in wind energy, ranking among the top five states for wind production in 2017.", "When it comes to state policy for both solar and wind, Kansas has been offering renewable developers and consumers very little.", "While Kansas offers a form of net metering and renewable energy tax exemption, there is very little in terms of incentives or rebates.", "While wind energy is plentiful due to the natural environment of this Great Plains state, Kansas only had a mere 27 MW of solar installed as of Q3 2018.", "With a divided government, Kansas is unlikely to push forward massive renewable energy legislation. However, having a Democratic governor is likely to result in her appointing two commissioners whose perspective she supports to the Kansas Corporation Commission.", "During a debate in the run-up to the election, Kelly said she would nominating commissioners who “keep the consumer in mind” as well as paying attention to the companies that they are responsible for regulating.", "Helfrich said this change could pay dividends a bit further down the road. “The biggest thing [moving forward] for the KCC is for energy efficiency.”", "Kelly can appoint “commissioners who want to see energy efficiency.”", "In the past, these commissioners have rejected plans from utilities that would account for these efficiency changes.", "Now, Helfrich said she believes that Kelly can select commissioners over the next few years who can change that trajectory over the long term.", "Despite her previous votes for increasing renewable energy, Kelly’s campaign website avoided the topic of increasing clean energy sources altogether.", "While Ceres has not engaged in Kansas as much as it has in other target states, Helfrich said that she is aware Kelly believes climate change is happening and knows that it is a big issue.", "Kelly has expressed support for wind power in the past.", "States Can Transform Renewable Energy Markets If Their Leaders Take Initiative", "The last major energy law was passed in the United States Congress in 2007. Since then, while efforts have been made by the Obama and Trump administrations through executive actions or unrelated bills, states have had to adjust to shifting federal policy priorities.", "Thus far, for states like California, Massachusetts and New York, the ability to influence clean energy through policy has allowed for major expansions of renewable energy resources.", "With the continued decline of installation costs for solar and wind, it now appears possible that state markets that did not have heavy policy levers previously can take advantage of these cost declines.", "“Upgrading and expanding transmission infrastructure is a key area where progress will help meet consumer demand for low-cost clean energy and provide new economic-investment opportunities in rural America,” Darin said when he described AWEA’s hopes for what the new governors will focus on in terms of wind energy policy.", "As always, the devil is in the implementation. Yet in two years’ time, the list of states with successful clean energy markets may surprise you.", "Summing up the opportunity for governors across the country, Helfrich said that clean energy policy change is imperative.", "“Changing the rules so that companies can do this is huge. They know that the state rules are relevant and they want to make those investments.”", "Explaining the role of Ceres and other advocates, Helfrich said: “Our role is to help [companies] identify the policy barriers and where they can shift them… to show decision-makers that this is about economics.”", "To comment on this article, please post in our LinkedIn group, contact us on Twitter, or use our contact form."]}

Most notably, FirstEnergy's report is noticeably shorter and less comprehensive than the other utilities' reports.", "That said, topics in the reports range from a status report on grid architecture (i.e., field automation, substation automation, operational communications infrastructure, sensing and measurement, operational analytics, and standardized access to customer energy usage data) to an assessment of distribution system planning practices and ability to integrate new technologies.", "In addition to the actions mentioned above, a few other states have continued their existing distribution system planning investigations in 2019, including Hawaii, Michigan, and Minnesota.", "One of the core outputs of distribution system planning is recognizing opportunities for new advanced technologies and services to meet system needs — which we explore next.", "4. Non-Wires Alternatives to Traditional Utility Investments", "Non-wires alternatives (NWAs) to traditional investments in transmission and distribution equipment are increasingly being looked to as viable options in several key states.", "The next steps to making NWAs a widespread reality are to (1) identify the areas where NWAs can meet a need at a lower cost than a traditional utility investment, and (2) develop a framework to implement and/or procure the NWA solution.", "Several states have made significant progress so far in 2019.", "In January 2019, Con Edison in New York outlined its plan to continue implementation of its Brooklyn Queens Demand Management (BQDM) program through 2021.", "The utility plans to continue procurement of additional load reduction above the original 41 MW of non-traditional customer-side electricity demand reduction solutions (projecting 44.5 MW by 2021) and 11 MW of non-traditional utility-side solutions (projecting 18 MW by 2021).", "For a deep dive on the BQDM program and its success so far, see AEE’s case study here.", "In June 2018, Central Maine Power and Emera Maine filed recommendations that would eliminate their existing incentive to favor transmission and distribution (T&D) investments over NWAs.", "Specifically, they called for: 1) a revenue decoupling mechanism, 2) a ratemaking approach to treat NWA investments in a similar manner to T&D investments, and 3) an approval process for NWA proposals.", "As a follow-on to those recommendations, the utilities were ordered to submit supplemental filings in March outlining how they consider and implement NWAs are part of their T&D investment planning processes.", "In May, the California Public Utilities Commission issued a ruling modifying the distribution investment deferral framework process, an annual process (first implemented in 2018) to identify, review, and select opportunities for third party-owned DERs to defer or avoid traditional capital investments.", "As part of the ruling, the CPUC streamlined the planning process to reduce the time associated with stakeholder participation.", "The Commission ordered utilities to file their grid needs assessment – identifying the technical and operational planning needs they need to meet five-year load growth forecasts – and a distribution deferral opportunity report – identifying utilities’ planned investments and opportunities for third party-owned DERs to avoid or defer those investments by August.", "5. Wildfire Liability Challenging California Utilities", "In January, the largest investor-owned utility in California — Pacific Gas & Electric (PG&E) — filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy because of accrued liabilities resulting from the devastating wildfires of 2018.", "As part of the bankruptcy process, PG&E sought and received approval for $5.5 billion in financing to support operations and ongoing safety initiatives during the bankruptcy process.", "There are still a lot of unanswered questions that will need to be sorted out through the courts. One of the most important questions for the advanced energy industry will be whether PG&E is granted the ability to renegotiate a portion of their existing $34.5 billion in renewable energy contracts to help pay down their debts.", "A decision that could encumber California’s efforts to meet its clean energy and greenhouse gas reduction goals.", "Outside of the bankruptcy process, the wildfires kick started wide ranging investigations into wildfire prevention and cost recovery plans, as well as PG&E’s safety culture.", "At the start of the year, the California Public Utilities Commission opened an investigation to determine if PG&E, as currently constituted, is able to provide safe electric and gas service and to review alternatives to PG&E's current management and operational structures.", "As a result of that investigation, the Commission established a Commission Advisory Panel of experts to advise the Commission on corporate governance issues to ensure that utilities are prioritizing safety moving forward.", "More pointedly, the Commission in late June introduced four proposals (which the Commission is currently seeking comments on) to improve PG&E’s safety culture.", "The four proposed pathways include: (1) separating PG&E into separate gas and electric utilities or selling the gas assets; (2) establishing periodic review of PG&E’s Certificate of Convenience and Necessity (CPCN) to operate as a monopoly in California; (3) modifying or eliminating PG&E's holding company structure; and (4) linking PG&E’s rate of return or return on equity to safety performance metrics.", "If adopted, any one of these pathways would have wide-ranging implications.", "Also in June, the CPUC adopted a set of criteria and a methodology for conducting a financial “stress test” for future wildfire cost recovery.", "The methodology is intended to inform determinations of the maximum amount an electric corporation can pay without affecting their ability to raise money in capital markets, which could ultimately harm ratepayers or affect their ability to provide safe and adequate service.", "As renewable energy has become more competitive on price, customers are increasingly looking for ways to not only power their operations with 100% renewable energy, but also dampen price volatility and reduce energy costs.", "There are several avenues for customers to increase their access to renewable energy ranging from direct access programs to renewable energy tariffs to community solar programs.", "(For a discussion of best practices and steps that states and utilities can take to meet large customer demand for renewable energy, see the Advanced Energy Buyers Group’s recent report here.)", "In January, Xcel Energy in Minnesota filed for approval to expand their Renewable*Connect Pilot Program (a renewable energy tariff aimed at businesses that want access to renewable energy) into a full-fledged program.", "Xcel stated that the pilot sold out in one year and there are more than 400 customers on a waiting list.", "In March, the California Public Utilities Commission opened a rulemaking to implement SB 237, reopening of the state’s direct access (DA) program.", "The DA program, which has been limited to about 11% of peak load since 2010, allows retail nonresidential customers to purchase electricity service directly from competitive providers.", "In June, the Commission issued a Phase 1 order to expand the DA cap by 4 TWh or an additional 2% to 3% of peak load allocated proportionally to the investor-owned utilities' service territories.", "Phase 2, which is expected to begin before the end of the year, will be focused on the second requirement of SB 237, issuing recommendations to the Legislature on a full expansion of the DA cap to nonresidential customers by June 1, 2020.", "In May, Dominion Energy In Virginia filed an application for a 100% renewable energy tariff that would allow customers with under 5 MW of peak demand to receive 100% of their energy and capacity from a portfolio of renewable resources owned or procured by Dominion for a premium over standard service.", "In March, Florida Power & Light (FP&L) proposed a solar subscription program — SolarTogether. The program would give customers of all rate classes the option to subscribe to blocks of solar capacity (with no long-term commitment) from dedicated 74.5 MW solar power plants.", "FPL stated it has already pre-registered 200 customers, totaling 1,000 MW, for the program, mostly from commercial and industrial customers.", "Community choice aggregation (CCA) or municipal aggregation has been around for a few decades but it has risen in popularity the past couple of years, driven in large part by communities wishing to take control over how their energy is generated.", "The concept of CCA is fairly simple.

A local company, EVstudio, designed the special helical piers for the arrays.", "This partnership was key to the success of the project in that the E-470 Authority did not incur any capital costs.", "In its first year of operation, the system produced over 1 million kWh of electricity, saving the E-470 Authority approximately $20,000 in energy costs.10 Twenty-one of the sites provided 100 percent of the electrical needs for two toll plazas, the primary maintenance facility, and 18 toll ramps; and the rooftop installation on the headquarters building provided 13 percent of the building's energy needs.11 In 2013, it was estimated that the system delivered 47 percent of E-470's overall power needs.12 Over 20 years, the E-470 Authority estimates a savings of over $1 million in electricity costs and avoidance of almost 17,000 metric tons of CO2 emissions.13 The E-470 Authority also installed two solar-powered road surveillance cameras where no electrical infrastructure existed, saving $150,000 in avoided electrical infrastructure costs.", "This project also contributes to Xcel Energy's government-mandated goal to acquire 30 percent of its electricity through renewable sources by 2020.", "The installation and continued maintenance of the solar project created 89 construction and electrical jobs in the local community.14", "In 2013, the E-470 Authority won International Bridge, Tunnel and Turnpike Association's Toll Excellence Award for social responsibility for its solar project.", "In April 2014, retail electricity costs had risen to 11.5 cents per kilowatt-hour, while the E-470 Authority continued to pay the PPA rate of 6.13 cents per kilowatt-hour.", "The increase in the state's RPS in 2010, along with the other financial incentives mentioned previously that Adamas Energy Investments was qualified to receive, helped the E-470 Authority secure favorable electricity rates.", "Buy-in from the E-470 Authority leadership for the project initially took some time, but after the financial analysis indicated that a PPA arrangement could deliver substantial benefits, the biggest challenges became the negotiation of the solar PPA and real estate lease agreements with Adamas Energy Investments, and the Solar Reservation Agreements with Xcel Energy.15", "In 2011, ODOT began to construct the nation's first and largest solar highway. Within one year, the Baldock Solar Station was up and running, including a 1.75-megawatt solar array with 7,000 solar panels.", "The station is along I-5 northbound, about 14 miles south of Portland and near Wilsonville, OR. It set a precedent for using sustainable energy in highway right-of-way, and continues to be an example of using renewable energy to power highways.", "Ideas from the Baldock Solar Station have since been used to implement other projects around the US and the world.", "The project is fully Oregon-based, using an Oregon-based solar company, Oregon management and consulting, and Oregon construction, analysis, and other materials.", "While the solar station's construction was slightly delayed due to funding issues, it now generates a massive amount of power for the surrounding community, and is a successful example of using a renewable resource in highway right-of-way.", "| Project Objectives | Location | Sizing | Array Type |", "| Provide discounted electricity to ODOT, make use of right-of-way, support renewable energy | Located in a field owned by ODOT, adjacent to a rest area | 1,750kW capacity (enough to power 287 homes) |", "The idea for the Baldock Solar Station was first in 2008, due to the successful implementation of solar panels along the Autobahn highway in Germany.", "At the time, no similar projects in the US had been attempted. Soon afterwards, a partnership with the Portland General Electric was formed, and Baldock was chosen as a site that would be quick to develop for solar panel use.", "Additionally, the project was expedited due to Oregon's Business Energy Tax Credit Program set to expire, which provided a 50 percent tax credit for eligible project costs.", "From 2010 to 2011, the project's progress began to slow as the state dealt with a budget crisis, but picked back up again at the end of 2011 and was completed in 2012.", "The construction of the solar station took five and one-half months.", "The Baldock Solar Station was built and is operated by Portland General Electric (PGE), but is situated on land owned by ODOT.", "The energy produced from the station provides 12 percent of ODOT's electricity need in the PGE Service Area.", "The project will also help Oregon reach its renewable energy standard of providing 25 percent of its power from renewable energy by 2025.", "The project cost about $10 million to complete, including funding from private financing, tax credits, and public investment.", "The solar array produces approximately 1.97 million kilowatt-hours of clean and renewable energy, which is helping ODOT to reach is renewable energy goals.", "Baldock will continue to provide a significant amount of ODOT's electricity needs in the PGE service area for 25 years with minimal upkeep costs.", "Additionally, the solar station eliminates about 43 metric tons of CO2 emissions that would otherwise be in the atmosphere.", "The entire highway transportation system in Oregon requires about 50 million kilowatt-hours of energy per year to run the lights, ramp metering, signals, etc.", "The Baldock Solar Station produces almost 2 million kilowatt-hours a year of energy. ODOT has about 19,000 lane miles of right-of-way, and installing solar panels on only 120 miles of this space would produce enough energy to meet the state's transportation energy requirements.", "By partnering with PGE, ODOT set themselves up for success. While working with private developers has its advantages, by working directly with PGE, ODOT or a partner developer did not have to negotiate with PGE over interconnection, or net metering.", "Since PGE is the electric utility and the system owner, they added a level of certainty to the project that contributed to its success.", "Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians Solar Farm - North Carolina", "Leech Lake Band of Ojibwe Community Solar Garden - Minnesota", "Lookout Solar Park Project on the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation - South Dakota", "Moapa Southern Paiute Solar Project - Clark County, Nevada", "Navajo Nation Kayenta Solar Program (Phase I & II) - Monument Valley, Arizona", "Sokaogon Chippewa Community (SCC) Solar Project - Nashville, Wisconsin", "Southern Ute Indian Tribe Oxford Solar Project - Ignacio, Colorado", "The Honeysuckle Solar Project - St. Joseph County, Indiana", "The Huslia Tribal Council Biomass Project - Huslia, Alaska", "Veterans' Glass City Skyway Solar Array - Toledo, Ohio", "1 Solar Energy Industries Association, https://www.seia.org/initiatives/whats-megawatt", "2 Pettey, Donald.

Relative to 2011 levels, the U.S. Energy Information Administration, or EIA, projects that natural gas consumption will grow 12.2 percent by 2030, even as low prices, debate about exports, and future carbon constraints create an uncertain trajectory for future natural gas development.", "EIA also predicts that 50.2 percent of new electricity consumption will come from natural gas and 46.6 percent from renewables by 2030.", "However, this prediction may be overly conservative. A Deutsche Bank analysis predicts that total coal-based electricity generation will fall from 45 percent in 2010 to 20 percent by 2030 and that natural gas will largely replace coal as the majority share of total electricity generation.", "Deutsche Bank also forecasts a 0.7 percent compound annual growth rate for electricity demand. This is consistent with the past 20-year rate of energy use, despite increased population and urbanization, due to anticipated improvements in efficiency over the next 20 years.", "As new and existing power plants turn from fossil fuels, energy efficiency will become a greater part of the U.S. energy portfolio.", "At the same time, wind and solar energy—which generated only 3 percent of U.S. electricity in 2010—are projected to experience significant growth and provide 17 percent of electricity by 2030.", "Base load hydropower and geothermal energy are predicted to maintain their current levels of 7 percent of power generation.", "Altogether, Deutsche Bank predicts that renewable electricity will account for one-quarter of all U.S. electricity generation by 2030.", "These findings may show only a slice of clean energy’s investment potential for three reasons.

As part of that obligation, the EPA is currently in the process of setting pollution standards for both the transportation sector and power plants.", "Both of these types of standards provide opportunities for technological innovation. In particular, the companies that make pollution-reducing and energy-efficient technology will be able to increase supply and energy-efficiency capacity to meet the increased demand for efficiency created by these pollution-limiting regulations.", "EPA carbon-pollution standards will require states to meet the federal emissions standards through either submitting their own implementation plans to the EPA or complying with a federal plan imposed on the state.", "Therefore, states have an incentive to create a plan that fits their unique energy portfolio.

And this week, the company announced it will be fast-tracking the retirement of its two remaining coal-burning power plants, which are in Minnesota, by 2030.", "So make no mistake: This is industry-shaking news. Here’s our explainer, first published December 5.", "Greater ambition is in Xcel’s political and economic interests", "Xcel has been a leader on clean energy for a while. According to the company, it has reduced its carbon emissions by 35 percent since 2005.", "Earlier in 2018, it announced plans to, by 2030, reduce carbon emissions 60 percent (from 2005 levels), increase the level of renewable energy in its fleet to 55 percent, and shut down 50 percent of its coal capacity — in the state of Colorado.", "Those goals were enough to win the company Utility Dive’s Utility of the Year Award for 2018.", "But the new goals go much farther. And they cover Xcel’s entire eight-state territory.", "So what pushed the company’s ambition so much higher?", "First, renewables are getting really cheap. In its recent solicitations, Xcel has gotten more bids for renewables, with more variety, for much cheaper.", "Wind and solar plants paired with storage are bidding in cheaper than the ongoing operating costs of existing coal plants.", "Renewables are even giving natural gas a run for its money.", "Second, Xcel’s customers — particularly cities — are demanding it. “When your customers are asking for this over and over,” Fowke said when announcing the news, “you really do listen.", "Boulder, the city of Denver, Breckenridge ... Pueblo, they’re considered or they have already decided that they want to pursue 100 percent renewable.”", "Remember that, because it’s important in an age of no federal climate policy: Cities can move utilities, and utilities can move the energy industry.", "Third, the political landscape is shifting. Democrats took the governor’s mansion in Colorado, Michigan, New Mexico, and Wisconsin.", "In Colorado and New Mexico, they now have a “trifecta” — governor and both legislative houses. Running for governor in Colorado, Jared Polis supported a new renewable energy standard of 100 percent by 2040; with Democratic majorities in the state legislature, he might get it passed.", "Renewables are on the rise in the West, popular with politicians, cities, corporations, and ordinary ratepayers.", "It is to Xcel’s benefit to get ahead of the curve and give the people what they want.", "Fourth, Xcel would very much like to build more stuff.", "It is a vertically integrated monopoly. The areas in which it operates have not been “restructured,” i.e., generation has not been split off from transmission and distribution.", "Regulated monopoly utilities, as I’ve explained in previous stories, do not make money on the power they sell or the fuel they buy.", "They make money by drawing a rate of return on investments in power infrastructure. These “rate-based” investments are the utility’s bread and butter.", "In a broad sense, the shift to renewables is good for such utilities. When they shift from existing fossil fuel plants to new renewable energy, they shift from fuel (coal and natural gas) costs, which they make no money on, to investments in new renewable energy power plants, new batteries to store power and electric car chargers to help electrify the vehicle fleet, and tons of new transmission lines, much of which they can rate-base.", "These goals (perhaps combined with a new, more stringent RPS in Colorado) will help Xcel get permission from regulators to depreciate lots of uneconomic old fossil-fuel assets (which activists have been hassling it about anyway) and build, build, build a bunch of new stuff.", "In short, Xcel stands to profit handsomely, and benefit politically, by giving its customers the clean energy they want.", "(Many ratepayer advocates worry that utilities like Duke are taking advantage of this dynamic, using clean energy as an excuse to build stuff that local, distributed energy could handle better — but that’s a different post.)", "A more interesting question is how this might affect Xcel’s monopoly status. On one hand, riding a political wave as a climate champion allows it to stay ahead of grumbling or desire for restructuring.", "On the other hand, Xcel suddenly needing so much clean energy might help grease the skids for regionalization, i.e., the creation of a restructured Western wholesale power market run by a regional transmission operator (RTO).", "If all of the West is heading toward decarbonization together, the region’s utilities will need to pool their resources.", "In fact, they might need to pool their resources rapidly, because the federal tax credits for wind and solar power are set to expire soon.", "Buying a lot of capacity before then could save a lot of money.", "Fifth — and this may be somewhat peripheral, but it’s interesting — on the very same day Xcel made its announcement, the Boulder City Council voted to move forward with creating a municipal utility and breaking off from Xcel.", "Xcel very much opposes that move. By ramping up its clean energy goals, it may not keep Boulder, but it could dissuade other similar-minded cities from following Boulder out the door.", "Anyway, the decision to go carbon-free by 2050 is not a selfless act on Xcel’s part — it sees which way the wind is blowing and is focused on providing returns for shareholders.", "And the announcement leaves many, many details unspecified, including plans to shut down fossil fuel plants and transition plans for affected communities.", "Nonetheless, it shows that incentives are beginning to align in a hopeful way. It is the smart move, politically and economically, for Xcel to set a course for zero carbon.", "That would have been unthinkable 10 or even five years ago.", "A few other aspects of this story are worth highlighting.", "Xcel explicitly did not promise 100 percent renewable electricity. It promised 100 percent carbon-free electricity.", "In this, it echoed California’s recent bill SB 100, which committed the state to 100 percent carbon-free energy by 2045.", "The difference is that carbon-free includes not only renewables but also advanced nuclear power plants and fossil fuel power plants with carbon capture and sequestration, either of which Xcel may end up needing to get to 100.", "The company believes that its 2030 goal can be achieved affordably with renewable energy and other technologies currently available.", "However, achieving the long-term vision of zero-carbon electricity requires technologies that are not cost effective or commercially available today.", "That is why Xcel Energy is committed to ongoing work to develop advanced technologies while putting the necessary policies in place to achieve this transition.", "Both sides of this message are incredibly important and poorly understood by the general public.", "First, we have a really good idea of how to get to 80 percent. Climate researcher Christopher Clack and his team showed in 2016 that the entire US could get to 80 percent using existing commercial technologies.", "We know we can get to 80, but 80 is a long, long way off almost everywhere. There is, in other words, no reason to wait.", "And second, we’re not yet sure how to get that last 20 percent, so we need to keep researching new techniques and technologies in the meantime.", "Xcel is going to work with state regulators to try to do some ratepayer-supported R&D. That seems like a really good idea.", "Targeting zero carbon before we know exactly how to achieve it is the kind of aspirational courage that will very much be needed if the US ever gets anything like a Green New Deal.", "A final side note here: Xcel runs two nuclear plants in Minnesota, which provide almost 30 percent of Xcel power in the Upper Midwest.", "Their licenses will be up around 2030. It’s very likely that to stay on track for its carbon targets, Xcel will need to keep those plants running for longer than that.", "Math like this is what has driven a substantial recent shift in opinion among greens about the wisdom of keeping existing nuclear plants open.", "Somewhat by coincidence, the same day Xcel made its announcement, A.P. Moller-Maersk, the world’s largest shipping container company, announced that it will target carbon neutrality by 2050, though, it said, “carbon neutral vessels must be commercially viable by 2030, and an acceleration in new innovations and adaption of new technology is required.”", "This came on the heels, last month, of Google’s announcement that it would strive to run all its operations on 100 percent clean energy, at all times, around the clock.", "There are now hundreds of companies (Ikea, Apple, BMW, Coca-Cola, Facebook, etc.), more than 90 US cities (Minneapolis, Denver, St. Louis, Atlanta, Salt Lake City, etc.), and two US states (Hawaii and California) committed to reaching 100 percent clean electricity.", "This is how the real target — zero net carbon — will arrive in the US: not in a blinding flash or a big federal bill (at least not at first), but like a virus or a meme, catching hold and spreading through contact.", "Researchers have found that both rooftop solar panels and electric vehicles are contagious. People are more likely to buy them when they see other people buying them.", "Human beings are social creatures, not autonomous utility maximizers. We don’t reason through our purchases and our lifestyles; we generally adopt what’s around us and do what people like us do.", "The very same is true of urban policy makers, corporate officers, utility executives, and state regulators.", "You can show them all the charts and graphs you want — until they see others like them doing these things, they won’t feel confident.", "Now more and more people are doing it, and more and more people are seeing other people doing it.

Many had hoped that the disastrous project was finally done for in November 2015, when the Obama administration vetoed the pipeline—acknowledging its pervasive threats to climate, ecosystems, drinking water sources, and public health.", "But immediately after taking office, President Donald Trump brought the zombie project back to life, along with the legal battles against it.", "By the time President Biden took office in 2021, ready to fulfill his campaign promise to revoke the cross-border permit, the dirty energy pipeline had become one of the foremost climate controversies of our time.", "Here’s everything you need to know about the historic KXL fight–and why the pipeline’s cancellation has had no impact on current oil prices.", "The Keystone XL pipeline extension, proposed by TC Energy (then TransCanada) in 2008, was initially designed to transport the planet’s dirtiest fossil fuel, tar sands oil, to market—and fast.", "As an expansion of the company’s existing Keystone Pipeline System, which has been operating since 2010 (and continues to send Canadian tar sands crude oil from Alberta to various processing hubs in the middle of the United States), the pipeline promised to dramatically increase capacity to process the 168 billion barrels of crude oil locked up under Canada’s boreal forest.", "It was expected to transport 830,000 barrels of Alberta tar sands oil per day to refineries on the Gulf Coast of Texas.", "From the refineries, the oil would be sent chiefly overseas—not to gasoline pumps in the United States.", "Some three million miles of oil and gas pipelines already run through our country, but KXL wasn’t your average pipeline, and tar sands oil isn’t your average crude.", "It's derived from a sludgy, sticky deposit found beneath the wilds of northern Alberta’s boreal forest.", "These sands contain bitumen, a gooey type of petroleum that can be converted into fuel. It’s no small feat extracting oil from tar sands, and doing so comes with steep environmental and economic costs.", "Nevertheless, in the mid-2000s, with gas prices on the rise, oil companies ramped up production and sought additional ways to move their product from Canada’s remote tar sands fields to midwestern and Gulf Coast refineries.", "The proposed Keystone XL extension actually comprised two segments. The first, a southern leg, had already been completed and now runs between Cushing, Oklahoma, and Port Arthur, Texas.", "Opponents of this project—now called the Gulf Coast Pipeline—say that TC Energy took advantage of legal loopholes to push the pipeline through, obtaining authorization under a U.S. Army Corps of Engineers nationwide permit and dodging the more rigorous vetting process for individual permits, which requires public input.", "The second segment was the hotly contested 1,209-mile northern leg—a shortcut of sorts—that would have run from Hardisty, Alberta, through Montana and South Dakota to Steele City, Nebraska.", "In 2015, the U.S. State Department, under President Barack Obama, declined to grant the northern leg of the Keystone XL project the permit required to construct, maintain, and operate the pipeline across the U.S.–Canada border—a permit that President Trump later granted and President Biden once again revoked.", "Dirty energy lobbyists claimed developing tar sands would protect our national energy security and bring U.S. fuel prices down.", "But environmental reviews by both the Obama and Trump administrations concluded that the Keystone XL pipeline would not have lowered gasoline prices.", "NRDC and its partners also found the majority of Keystone XL oil would have been sent to markets overseas—aided by a 2015 reversal of a ban on crude oil exports.", "This lines up with an industry trend: Oil and gas companies are exporting 8.4 million barrels of crude oil and refined fuels every single day.", "That’s up nearly threefold from a decade ago, and an amount equal to 42 percent of our consumption. And these exports are more than 10 times the capacity of the proposed Keystone XL pipeline.", "Tar sands oil is thicker, more acidic, and more corrosive than lighter conventional crude, and this ups the likelihood that a pipeline carrying it will leak.", "Indeed, one study found that between 2007 and 2010, pipelines moving tar sands oil in Midwestern states spilled three times more per mile than the U.S. national average for pipelines carrying conventional crude.", "Since it first went into operation in 2010, TC Energy’s original Keystone Pipeline System has leaked more than a dozen times; one incident in North Dakota sent a 60-foot, 21,000-gallon geyser of tar sands oil spewing into the air.", "Less than two years before the project was finally pulled, the Keystone tar sands pipeline was temporarily shut down after a spill in North Dakota of reportedly more than 378,000 gallons in late October 2019.", "And the risk that Keystone XL would have spilled was heightened because of the extended time the pipe segments were left sitting outside in stockpiles.", "“A study published in early 2020, co-authored by TC Energy’s own scientists, found that the anti-corrosion coating on the project’s pipes was damaged from being stored outside and exposed to the elements for the last decade,” notes NRDC senior attorney Jaclyn Prange, who spent years working on KXL litigation.", "Complicating matters, leaks can be difficult to detect. And when tar sands oil does spill, it’s more difficult to clean up than conventional crude because it immediately sinks to the bottom of the waterway.", "People and wildlife coming into contact with tar sands oil are exposed to toxic chemicals, and rivers and wetland environments are at particular risk from a spill.", "(For evidence, note the 2010 tar sands oil spill in Kalamazoo River, Michigan, a disaster that cost Enbridge more than a billion dollars in cleanup fees and took six years to settle in court.)", "Keystone XL would have crossed agriculturally important and environmentally sensitive areas, including hundreds of rivers, streams, aquifers, and water bodies.", "One was Nebraska’s Ogallala Aquifer, which provides drinking water for millions as well as 30 percent of America’s irrigation water.", "A spill would have been devastating to the farms, ranches, and communities that depend on these crucial ecosystems.", "Even worse, building Keystone XL would have meant enduring those risks just to send the fuel to our overseas rivals—and the profits to Big Oil.", "All facets of the tar sands industry pose a threat to the environment. Its mines are a blight on Canada’s boreal, where mining operations dig up and flatten forests to access the oil below, destroying wildlife habitat and one of the world’s largest carbon sinks.", "The mining depletes and pollutes freshwater resources, creates massive ponds of toxic waste, and threatens the health and livelihood of the First Nations people who live near them.", "Refining the sticky black gunk produces piles of petroleum coke, a hazardous, coal-like by-product. What’s more, the whole process of getting the oil out and making it usable creates three to four times the carbon pollution of conventional crude extraction and processing.", "“This isn’t your grandfather’s typical oil,” says Anthony Swift, director of NRDC’s Canada project. “It’s nasty stuff.”", "A fully realized Keystone XL would have led to more mining of that “nasty stuff” by accelerating the pace at which it’s produced and transported.", "(Indeed, Keystone XL was viewed as an essential ingredient in the oil industry’s plans to triple tar sands production by 2030.)", "It would also have led to greater greenhouse gas emissions—which, the latest scientific reports makes clear, we simply can’t afford if we’re to avoid the most catastrophic climate impacts.", "The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) initially stated that, on a wells-to-wheels basis, tar sands oil emits 17 percent more carbon than other types of crude, but several years later, the State Department revised this number upward, stating that the emissions could be “5 percent to 20 percent higher than previously indicated.”", "That means burdening the planet with an extra 178.3 million metric tons of greenhouse gas emissions annually, the same impact as 38.5 million passenger vehicles or 45.8 coal-fired power plants.", "Finally, massive fossil fuel infrastructure investments like KXL undermine efforts to minimize global warming and prioritize clean energy like wind and solar.", "Leading climate scientist and former NASA researcher James Hansen has warned that fully exploiting Canada’s tar sands reserves by moving forward with these projects would mean “game over” for our climate.", "In short, tar sands oil represents no small threat to our environment, and our best stance against it, as the rallying cry goes, is to “keep it in the ground.”", "Opposition to Keystone XL centered on the devastating environmental consequences of the project. The pipeline faced more than a decade of sustained protests from environmental activists and organizations; Indigenous communities; religious leaders; and the farmers, ranchers, and business owners along its proposed route.", "One such protest, a historic act of civil disobedience outside the White House in August 2011, resulted in the arrest of more than 1,200 demonstrators.", "“This is not a pipeline to America,” said the late civil rights activist Julian Bond, among the many arrested.", "“It’s a pipeline through America, and it threatens to be a disaster for us if it leaks poisons on the way.”", "Leading scientists and economists came out in opposition to the project, in addition to unions and world leaders such as the Dalai Lama, Archbishop Desmond Tutu, and former president Jimmy Carter (together, these and other Nobel laureates have written letters against the project).", "In 2014, more than two million comments urging a rejection of the pipeline were submitted to the U.S. Department of State during a 30-day public comment period.", "But the groundswell of public protest was up against a formidable opponent–hundreds of millions spent on lobbying by the fossil fuel industry.", "In the two years leading up to the November 2014 midterm elections, the fossil fuel industry spent more than $721 million to court allies in Congress.", "When industry-friendly politicians took charge of both congressional houses in January 2015, their first order of business was to pass a bill to speed up approval of Keystone XL.", "(That effort failed.) Later, fossil fuel companies funnelled millions into Trump’s 2017 inauguration ceremony, days after which he brought the Keystone XL project back from the dead, and ramped up federal lobbying efforts in the first months of his administration.", "“So what if there’s no pipeline? Big Oil will find a way.”", "One of the central arguments made by pipeline pushers was that tar sands expansion will move forward with or without Keystone XL.", "This has proved to be untrue. Dealing in tar sands oil is an expensive endeavor. It’s costly both to produce and to ship, particularly by rail, which would be an alternative to Keystone XL.", "Indeed, moving crude by rail to the Gulf costs substantially more than moving it by pipe. For companies considering whether to invest in a long-lived tar sands project (which could last for 50 years), access to cheap pipeline capacity plays a major role in the decision to move forward or not.", "Without Keystone XL, the tar sands industry has been forced to cancel projects rather than shift to rail, subsequently leaving more of the earth’s dirtiest fuel in the ground where it belongs.", "The industry also falsely claimed that the pipeline would be a big source of jobs.", "When TC Energy said the pipeline would create nearly 119,000 jobs, a State Department report instead concluded the project would require fewer than 2,000 two-year construction jobs and that the number of full-time, permanent jobs would hover around 35 after construction.", "When the Obama administration refused to grant the cross-border permit necessary to build TC Energy’s Keystone XL oil pipeline in November 2015, it struck a blow against polluting powers and acknowledged the consensus on this misguided project from a wide swath of communities, experts, and organizations.", "The decision echoed a seven-year State Department review process with EPA input that concluded the pipeline would fail to serve national interests.", "Upon entering office, President Trump—with his pro-polluter cabinet of fossil fuel advocates, billionaires, and bankers—quickly demonstrated that his priorities differed.", "On his fourth day in office, Trump signed an executive order to allow Keystone XL to move forward. On March 28, 2017, his State Department illegally approved a cross-border permit for the pipeline, reversing the Obama administration’s prior determination that KXL would not serve the national interest.", "When that failed—thanks to a lawsuit brought by NRDC and other groups—Trump reissued the cross-border permit himself.", "“We would score a victory, and it would have huge ramifications for holding off construction at critical times,” says NRDC attorney Cecilia Segal, who has worked on KXL litigation since 2017.", "“But then the Trump administration would do something to undercut us outside of court.” The administration also attempted to issue other permits for the project, all based on flawed environmental analyses, eventually prompting more lawsuits, including two from NRDC and its allies.", "Opposition outside the courts was swift and strong as well. Farmers, ranchers, tribes, and conservation groups helped keep the project stalled for Trump’s full four years in office, despite his best efforts to expedite its approval.", "President Biden and the end of the Keystone XL pipeline", "Even as Trump and TC Energy tried to revive the pipeline, polls showed that a majority of Americans opposed it.", "The market case had also deteriorated. Low oil prices and increasing public concern over the climate led Shell, Exxon, Equinor (then Statoil), and Total to either sell their tar sands assets or whittle them down.", "Meanwhile, major new tar sands projects stopped moving forward, despite investments from the government of Alberta, Canada.", "For example, in 2020, Teck Resources withdrew its 10-year application to build the largest tar sands mine in history, citing growing concern surrounding climate change in global markets.", "On the campaign trail, Biden vowed to cancel the Keystone XL cross-border permit should he win the presidency—and on his first day in office, he made good on that promise.", "The revoked permit became the final nail in the pipeline’s coffin. By that point, Keystone XL faced an unfriendly administration, numerous legal challenges, declining oil prices, worsening climate impacts, and a growing movement of climate organizers—along the pipeline’s route and around the world—unwilling to look the other way.", "In June 2021, TC Energy announced that it was abandoning its plans for building the pipeline for good—putting an end to a fossil fuel project that had loomed over waterways, communities, and the climate for more than a decade.", "“Keystone XL was a terrible idea from the start,” Swift said. “It’s time to accelerate our transition to the clean energy sources that will power a prosperous future.”", "While the tar sands industry was once seen as an unbeatable opponent in a David-and-Goliath fight, the victory against Keystone XL shows that the tables have begun to turn–and that more power now lies with the advocates for climate justice than ever before.", "“The era of building fossil fuel pipelines without scrutiny of their potential impact on climate change and on local communities is over,” Swift says.", "This story was originally published on April 7, 2017, and has been updated with new information and links.", "This NRDC.org story is available for online republication by news media outlets or nonprofits under these conditions: The writer(s) must be credited with a byline; you must note prominently that the story was originally published by NRDC.org and link to the original; the story cannot be edited (beyond simple things such as grammar); you can’t resell the story in any form or grant republishing rights to other outlets; you can’t republish our material wholesale or automatically—you need to select stories individually; you can’t republish the photos or graphics on our site without specific permission; you should drop us a note to let us know when you’ve used one of our stories.", "The Desire to Stop Canadian Tar Sands Transcends Borders"]}

King and Sherco 3 coal-fired power plants (which, in combination with the company’s earlier proposals to retire the other Sherco coal units in 2023 and 2026, will mark the end of Xcel Energy’s coal burning in Minnesota).", "- Solar and Wind.

Xcel Energy proposes to request an extension of the Monticello nuclear power plant’s operating license and run it for at least an additional 10 years (to 2040 from the date of its current license expiration in 2030).", "Regulators must consider whether the plant can continue to operate safely for that long and what investments are needed to replace aging equipment compared to investing in other low-cost, carbon-free alternatives such as solar, wind, and battery storage.", "- Renewables and reliability. Xcel Energy discusses a potential post-2030 need for “firm dispatchable resources” but does not specify what those resources will be in this round of planning.", "As a result, it’s vital that the current resource plan properly consider the attributes of renewable energy, battery storage, and transmission expansion in providing future reliability needs—both to inform the company’s future resource plans and to avoid premature assumptions that another gas-fired power plant will be needed.", "- Equity for communities and workers. We and other stakeholders are examining how Xcel Energy’s plan should do more to ensure sharing of clean energy benefits to low- and moderate-income customers and to provide meaningful options to displaced workers at power plant locations.", "The plan should also include additional opportunities for growth in smaller-scale solar resources installed on rooftops or located in communities.", "For more information on these important points, please see the helpful scorecard on Xcel Energy’s IRP developed by environmental and community energy advocates.", "Stakeholders, residents, and business owners have an opportunity to make their voices heard on Xcel Energy’s resource plan during this month’s public meetings.", "And anyone can weigh in Minnesota’s clean energy future by submitting a public comment through January 8th (see this notice for more details on how to submit).", "Join us in supporting Xcel Energy’s goal of 100 percent carbon-free electricity and phasing out coal plants with clean energy technologies like wind, solar, and energy efficiency.", "And join us in urging regulators to ensure that Xcel Energy pursues the least risky and most cost-effective resources to achieve its long-term goals."]}

(State law specifically exempted Diablo Canyon from these new requirements.", "Because no permanent disposal site for nuclear waste is now available in the United States, these facilities temporarily store their nuclear waste on site, either in water or in “dry case” cement casings.)", "Potential Risks Associated With Nuclear Power Generation", "Nuclear power plants present potential safety and security risks generally not associated with other types of energy-generating facilities.", "Unlike other types of power plants, each nuclear power plant contains large quantities of radioactive material which, if released—through natural disaster, human error, or malicious intent—may cause widespread public harm.", "As a result, these plants are subject to extensive federal and state regulatory requirements pertaining to their safe operation, security, mitigation of their potential environmental impacts, and the establishment of emergency response procedures in the event of any mishap at a nuclear facility.", "This measure immediately prohibits the generation of nuclear power in the state until such time as the CEC finds, and the Legislature affirms, that the federal government has identified and approved a demonstrated technology for:", "The measure would result in the immediate shut down of Diablo Canyon. The plant would remain shut down until such time as the conditions outlined above were met.", "When the Conditions Might Be Met. As noted earlier, this measure halts the operation of nuclear power plants in California until such time as the CEC determines, and the Legislature affirms, that certain conditions have been met.", "Thus, the fiscal effects of this proposed initiative would depend in part upon when a federally approved technology exists for the construction and operation of nuclear fuel rod reprocessing plants and for the permanent disposal of high-level nuclear waste.", "It is our understanding that it is unlikely the conditions allowing the resumption of nuclear power generation in the state would be met for at least many years.", "Replacement Power. According to energy planners, some traditional natural gas plants (inside and outside the state) likely have sufficient capacity to replace the electricity currently provided by Diablo Canyon at least in the near term.", "However, upgrades to the transmission and distribution system could be needed in order to support replacement power.", "Economic Impacts Could Affect State and Local Revenues and Costs", "This measure could have significant effects on the California economy which, in turn, could impact both state and local government revenues and costs.", "Increased Costs for Electricity. This measure could result in an increase in electricity rates due to an overall reduction in the state’s supply of electricity.", "The long-term impact of the measure on electricity rates would depend on the costs for replacement power and the extent to which upgrades to the transmission and distribution system are needed to support replacement power.", "The increases in electricity rates under these circumstances could affect state and local government revenues and costs.", "First, they could negatively impact the California economy which, in turn, could translate into a loss of revenues to the state and local government.", "Tax revenues received by governments are affected by business profits, personal income, and taxable sales—all of which, in turn, are affected by what individuals and businesses pay for electricity.", "Increases in electricity rates due to the measure would also directly increase state and local government costs since they are large consumers of electricity.", "State Could Be Held Liable to Compensate Utilities for Investment Losses. Under current state law, IOUs are generally allowed to recover costs associated with their capital investments through the ratemaking process.", "If this measure were enacted and resulted in the shutdown of Diablo Canyon, it is possible that ratepayers might have to compensate PG&E for some portion of its investment loss, which would increase electricity rates.", "It is also possible that either a federal or state court could find that the measure’s required shutdown amounts to a “taking” of private property and as such would require “just compensation for any uncompensated capital costs,” which could total more than $2 billion.", "However, the state’s potential liability in this area is uncertain.", "Reduced State and Local Financial Exposure From Potential Nuclear Emergencies", "Under this measure, state and local governments could avoid potential future costs and loss of revenues that they might otherwise incur in the event of a major release of radioactivity into the surrounding environment from the nuclear power plant.", "Major releases of radioactivity into the environment from nuclear power plants have rarely occurred. In part, this is likely due to the regulatory requirements affecting their security and safe operation as well as building standards designed to help plants withstand major natural disasters.", "In the event that such a release of radioactivity did occur, experts in this field indicate that it could result in major direct governmental costs for emergency response and lost governmental revenues due to widespread economic disruption.", "The immediate shutdown of Diablo Canyon under the measure could therefore reduce some of the exposure of the state and nearby local governments to the substantial costs and lost revenues that could otherwise result from a major release of radiation.", "However, this measure may not alleviate all of the financial exposure to the state and local governments because the current lack of permanent storage options for nuclear waste means that all nuclear waste will remain stored on site at the plant even if its operations were shut down until the federal government approves an alternative storage site.", "These potential avoidable impacts could collectively amount to billions of dollars. The financial exposure of state and local governments to such costs would, however, be offset to some extent by federally mandated liability insurance requirements on the nuclear industry as well as potential federal financial assistance in the event of a major emergency.", "These state and local fiscal impacts, however, could still be major.", "We estimate that this measure could have the following major fiscal effects:"]}

study brought new insights about meal planning practices and their relationship with dietary quality and weight status.", "Meal planning was associated with better adherence to nutritional guidelines and higher food variety.", "Furthermore, planning meals was associated with lower odds of being overweight and obese in women and of being obese in men.", "In our study, despite significant differences regarding sociodemographic, economic and lifestyle characteristics due to the large sample size, meal planners and non-meal planners exhibited very similar profiles.", "In particular, no significant difference in meal planning was observed in relation with the presence of children in the household.", "This result appears in contrast with previous qualitative studies suggesting that the presence of children increases the feeling of time scarcity [17, 23–26, 60] and therefore the need of developing time-saving strategies, such as meal planning.", "However, fatigue and time scarcity can also decrease the likelihood for following meal plans [26].", "To our knowledge, this study is the first to describe meal planning practices in a general population sample.", "Overall, more than one out two participants revealed to plan their meals at least occasionally. Generally, individuals planned their meals several times a week, for a few days period including weekdays and weekend, and get inspiration mostly from their personal recipe repertoire or ingredients available during grocery shopping.", "A previous survey evaluating Canadians’ attitudes and habits with regard to home food preparation highlighted that about 40% of the participants decide what they will prepare for dinner during the day, 27% the day before and 33% at least two days before [29].", "However, the latter did not explore the modalities of meal planning.", "Based on a large sample of general population, our data support the notion that planning meal is indeed associated with a better adherence to nutritional guidelines and an increased food variety (overall, fruits and vegetables).", "However, it should be noted that only small differences were observed with energy, macronutrient and food group intakes specifically.", "Although meal planning has been previously suggested as a potential tool to improve dietary quality [28, 29], to our knowledge, no study in the literature has investigated this related association.", "Previous authors highlighted that individuals deciding in advance what to prepare for dinner were more likely to cook homemade dishes [29].", "Since more frequent food preparation has been linked with a better diet quality [12–14], this could potentially explain the healthier diet observed in meal planners.", "A few hypotheses can be made on how meal planning could encourage home food preparation. First, meal planning might address the issue of not knowing what to prepare for dinner, that has been previously described as a barrier for home meal preparation [29].", "Second, by planning meals individuals may think about recipes that can be prepared in a limited period of time and, therefore reduce the feeling of time scarcity, that may limit home meal preparation", "[6, 12, 16] and increase the recourse to food choice coping strategies such as eating out, delivery meals or ready prepared food", "[17, 23–25]. In addition, planning meals may reduce the risk of missing ingredients for home meal preparation which could also lead to the consumption of food prepared away from home.", "Finally, deciding what foods will be eaten in the next few days could also enable individuals to cook more diversified recipes and to anticipate grocery shopping for the specific ingredients needed, thus potentially explaining the increased food variety observed in meal planners.", "However, reverse causality cannot be excluded since individuals interested in having a healthy diet might be more likely to plan their meals.", "In line with this idea, meal-planners in our sample were more likely to have higher educational level, to have higher income, to be physically active and to have a lower BMI, characteristics that have been related with a better attitude towards healthy eating [61].", "Our results showed that women who planned meals were less likely to be overweight or obese, while in men, there was an association with obesity only.", "Since meal planners have a diet of higher quality, it potentially prevents overweight in these individuals [52].", "However, we cannot exclude reverse causality. People attaching more importance to food and weight management might be more likely to plan their meals.", "In line with this hypothesis, two studies in the literature highlighted that meal planning is more frequently used by successful weight loss maintainers compared to those who did not maintain weight losses [36, 37].", "In terms of public health, our results bring supportive insights that promoting meal planning might encourage the preparation of healthier and more varied home meals.", "Previous studies showed that parents would be interested in learning how to plan meals [28, 60], however, other findings suggested that meal planning is also perceived as complex and time consuming [62].", "Specific tools might assist people in managing meal planning but to be adopted and sustainable over time, it is important to identify consumers’ needs.", "The present data highlighted that there are various ways of planning meals. As an example, we observed that the ingredients available during grocery shopping are likely to influence meal planning while existing tools rather propose menus to plan grocery shopping.", "A major strength of this study was its large sample size allowing an evaluation of meal planning practices at a population level.", "The wide range of socio-economic and lifestyle variables collected through the web-based platform enables the control of potential effects of confounding factors.", "In addition, the web-based tool used to assess 24-h dietary records has shown a good validity in prior studies [63, 64].", "However, because of the influence of seasonality on food variety, the FFQ was used to evaluate dietary variety since it allows usual intake estimates over a relatively long period of time [65].", "This study was also subject to several limitations. First, the cross-sectional design of this study prevented any inference of causality.", "Moreover, since participants were volunteers in a nutrition focused cohort, they may have higher health consciousness and interest in nutritional issues.", "The fact that we selected only participants who completed both dietary assessment tools might have exacerbated this characteristic in our sample.", "Therefore, caution is needed when generalizing our results. However, sensitivity analyses including individuals with at least one of the dietary assessments (24-h dietary records or FFQ) revealed similar trends.", "Besides, the fact that participants had relatively high knowledge in nutrition could potentially account for the few differences observed in energy and food group intakes, since they may be able to cook healthful meals without planning meals.", "It is also important to consider that food variety score was based on FFQ data, which has been recorded at different time frames (16 months after the inclusion in the cohort).", "Thus, for participants included since a long time in the cohort study, the estimation may not represent their current dietary repertoire.", "In addition, data were self-reported, thus potentially leading to misreporting due, for example, to desirability bias.", "Nonetheless, previous validation studies performed on a subsample of the NutriNet-Santé study have supported the good validity of self-reported anthropometric and dietary data [63, 64, 66].", "Finally, given that meal planning may be influenced by numerous parameters such as cooking practices and food availability in the surrounding, it is possible that some factors mediating the associations observed in the present paper were not taken into account in the analyses.", "The potential impact of cooking practices was however considered by adding cooking frequency as a confounder.", "Future research should be conducted to address the issue of how food availability could potentially influence the relationship observed between meal planning and diet quality.", "Our results highlighted that individuals planning their meals were more likely to have a better dietary quality, including a higher adherence with nutritional guidelines as well as an increased food variety.", "Additionally, meal planning was associated with lower odds of being obese in men and women and overweight in women only.", "Although interventional or prospective research should be conducted in order to infer causality, these data suggest the potential interest of promoting meal planning to improve dietary quality and prevent overweight.", "Such a tool could partly address the issue of time scarcity reported by consumers for meal preparation and, might therefore encourage home cooking.", "Given the potential benefits of meal planning identified in this study, it would be interesting that future research evaluate the appropriation and the impact of applications designed to help individuals planning their meals.", "We thank all scientists, dieticians, technicians, and assistants who help carry out the NutriNet-Santé study.", "We especially thank Younes Esseddik, Yasmina Chelghoum, Mohand Ait Oufella, Paul Flanzy and Thi Hong Van Duong, computer scientists; Veronique Gourlet, Charlie Menard, Fabien Szabo, Nathalie Arnault, Laurent Bourhis and Stephen Besseau, statisticians; and the dieticians.", "We are grateful to volunteers from the NutriNet-Santé study.", "The NutriNet-Santé Study is supported by the French Ministry of Health (DGS), the French Institute for Public Health Surveillance (InVS), the French National Institute for Health and Medical Research (INSERM), the French National Institute for Agricultural Research (INRA), the Medical Research Foundation (FRM), the National Conservatory for Arts and Crafts (CNAM), the National Institute for Prevention and Health Education (INPES) and the University of Paris 13.", "This study is supported by the National Institute for Prevention and Health Education (INPES).", "In France, there is a very strict regulation concerning the protection of personal data and privacy making difficult the availability of data (even non-nominal data).", "PD: conducted the literature review, drafted the manuscript and performed analyses; CM, VA, GI, BA, EKG, SH and SP: were involved in the interpretation of results and critically reviewed the manuscript; and SH and SP: were responsible for the development of the design and the protocol of the study.", "All authors read and approved the final manuscript.", "The authors declare that they have no competing interests.", "This study is conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki, and all procedures were approved by the Institutional Review Board of the French Institute for Health and Medical Research (IRB Inserm n°0000388FWA00005831) and the Commission Nationale de l’Informatique et des Libertés (CNIL n°908450 and n°909216).", "All participants provided informed consent with an electronic signature.

Energy, nutrient and food group intakes were estimated using the NutriNet-Santé composition table including more than 2000 foods [42].", "Dietary underreporting was identified on the basis of the method proposed by Black [43]. We hypothesize that meal planning encourages food preparation and therefore considered food groups that can be used in food preparation (e.g. eggs).", "In addition, we considered food groups that have nutritional interest (e.g. fruits). Thus, the following food groups were included in the study: fruits, vegetables, fish (including seafood and processed seafood), meat (including cooked ham, offal), eggs, milk, cheese, added fats (including oil, butter, margarine, vinaigrette), sugary products (e.g. cake, biscuits, sugars, honey, jam, chocolate) and starchy foods (including potato, legumes, pasta, rice, other cereals) with a specific focus on legumes and whole grain starchy foods (including whole grain pasta, rice, other cereals).", "Adherence to nutritional guidelines was assessed using the PNNS Guideline Score (PNNS-GS). The 15-point PNNS-GS is a validated a priori score reflecting the adherence to the official French nutritional guidelines which has been extensively described elsewhere [44].", "Details on computation of this score are in Additional file 1. Briefly, it includes 13 components: eight refer to food-serving recommendations (fruit and vegetables; starchy foods; whole grain products; dairy products; meat, eggs and fish; fish and seafood; vegetable fat; water vs. soda), four refer to moderation in consumption (added fat; salt; sweets; alcohol) and one component pertains to physical activity [44, 45].", "Points are deducted for overconsumption of salt (>12 g/day), added sugars (>17.5% of energy intake), or when energy intake exceeds the needed energy level by more than 5%.", "Each component cut-off was that of the threshold defined by the PNNS public health objectives when available [45] otherwise they were established according to the French Recommended Dietary Allowances [46].", "For the present analysis, we consider the mPNNS-GS, a modified version of the PNNS-GS, which takes into account only the dietary components, therefore excluding the physical activity component.", "Food variety has been defined as the number of different food items reported to be eaten over a given reference period [47].", "Considering that seasonality is likely to influence food variety and that a period of 10 to 15 days has been recommended to accurately assess food variety [48], the food variety was evaluated using a Food Frequency Questionnaire (FFQ).", "Sixteen months after baseline, participants were invited to complete a self-administrated 240-items FFQ to assess their usual dietary intake over the past year [49].", "Participants were asked to report their consumption frequency on the basis of how many times they ate the standard portion size proposed (typical household measurements such as spoon or standard unit such as a yogurt).", "The frequency of consumption referred to usual consumption over the past year on an increasing scale including yearly, monthly, weekly or daily units, as suitable, and participants were asked to provide only one answer.", "The food variety score corresponded to the number of FFQ items reported to be consumed at least once during the last year [47].", "The maximum score was therefore 240. Fruit and vegetable variety scores were also computed based on the number of different fruits and vegetables reported by the participants.", "Height and weight were assessed by using an anthropometric questionnaire, which was self-administered online, at baseline and each year thereafter [50, 51].", "For each participant, the closest available data to the meal planning questionnaire were used for the analysis.", "Data were not collected for pregnant women. BMI (in kg/m2) was calculated as the ratio of weight to squared height.", "Participants were classified as underweight or normal weight (BMI < 25), overweight (25 ≤ BMI < 30) and obesity (BMI ≥ 30) according to WHO references values [52].", "The analysis focused on participants who had completed the meal planning questionnaire, had declared being involved in meal preparation in their household, and who had completed at least three 24-h dietary records since they were included in the study, as well as the FFQ.", "Chi-square tests and Student’s t tests were used to compare characteristics of included vs. excluded participants, as well as meal planners vs. non-meal planners.", "Meal planners’ practices were also described.

First, meal planning might address the issue of not knowing what to prepare for dinner, that has been previously described as a barrier for home meal preparation [29].", "Second, by planning meals individuals may think about recipes that can be prepared in a limited period of time and, therefore reduce the feeling of time scarcity, that may limit home meal preparation", "[6, 12, 16] and increase the recourse to food choice coping strategies such as eating out, delivery meals or ready prepared food", "[17, 23–25]. In addition, planning meals may reduce the risk of missing ingredients for home meal preparation which could also lead to the consumption of food prepared away from home.", "Finally, deciding what foods will be eaten in the next few days could also enable individuals to cook more diversified recipes and to anticipate grocery shopping for the specific ingredients needed, thus potentially explaining the increased food variety observed in meal planners.", "However, reverse causality cannot be excluded since individuals interested in having a healthy diet might be more likely to plan their meals.", "In line with this idea, meal-planners in our sample were more likely to have higher educational level, to have higher income, to be physically active and to have a lower BMI, characteristics that have been related with a better attitude towards healthy eating [61].", "Our results showed that women who planned meals were less likely to be overweight or obese, while in men, there was an association with obesity only.", "Since meal planners have a diet of higher quality, it potentially prevents overweight in these individuals [52].", "However, we cannot exclude reverse causality. People attaching more importance to food and weight management might be more likely to plan their meals.", "In line with this hypothesis, two studies in the literature highlighted that meal planning is more frequently used by successful weight loss maintainers compared to those who did not maintain weight losses [36, 37].", "In terms of public health, our results bring supportive insights that promoting meal planning might encourage the preparation of healthier and more varied home meals.", "Previous studies showed that parents would be interested in learning how to plan meals [28, 60], however, other findings suggested that meal planning is also perceived as complex and time consuming [62].", "Specific tools might assist people in managing meal planning but to be adopted and sustainable over time, it is important to identify consumers’ needs.", "The present data highlighted that there are various ways of planning meals. As an example, we observed that the ingredients available during grocery shopping are likely to influence meal planning while existing tools rather propose menus to plan grocery shopping.", "A major strength of this study was its large sample size allowing an evaluation of meal planning practices at a population level.", "The wide range of socio-economic and lifestyle variables collected through the web-based platform enables the control of potential effects of confounding factors.", "In addition, the web-based tool used to assess 24-h dietary records has shown a good validity in prior studies [63, 64].", "However, because of the influence of seasonality on food variety, the FFQ was used to evaluate dietary variety since it allows usual intake estimates over a relatively long period of time [65].", "This study was also subject to several limitations. First, the cross-sectional design of this study prevented any inference of causality.", "Moreover, since participants were volunteers in a nutrition focused cohort, they may have higher health consciousness and interest in nutritional issues.", "The fact that we selected only participants who completed both dietary assessment tools might have exacerbated this characteristic in our sample.", "Therefore, caution is needed when generalizing our results. However, sensitivity analyses including individuals with at least one of the dietary assessments (24-h dietary records or FFQ) revealed similar trends.", "Besides, the fact that participants had relatively high knowledge in nutrition could potentially account for the few differences observed in energy and food group intakes, since they may be able to cook healthful meals without planning meals.", "It is also important to consider that food variety score was based on FFQ data, which has been recorded at different time frames (16 months after the inclusion in the cohort).", "Thus, for participants included since a long time in the cohort study, the estimation may not represent their current dietary repertoire.", "In addition, data were self-reported, thus potentially leading to misreporting due, for example, to desirability bias.", "Nonetheless, previous validation studies performed on a subsample of the NutriNet-Santé study have supported the good validity of self-reported anthropometric and dietary data [63, 64, 66].", "Finally, given that meal planning may be influenced by numerous parameters such as cooking practices and food availability in the surrounding, it is possible that some factors mediating the associations observed in the present paper were not taken into account in the analyses.", "The potential impact of cooking practices was however considered by adding cooking frequency as a confounder.", "Future research should be conducted to address the issue of how food availability could potentially influence the relationship observed between meal planning and diet quality.", "Our results highlighted that individuals planning their meals were more likely to have a better dietary quality, including a higher adherence with nutritional guidelines as well as an increased food variety.", "Additionally, meal planning was associated with lower odds of being obese in men and women and overweight in women only.", "Although interventional or prospective research should be conducted in order to infer causality, these data suggest the potential interest of promoting meal planning to improve dietary quality and prevent overweight.", "Such a tool could partly address the issue of time scarcity reported by consumers for meal preparation and, might therefore encourage home cooking.", "Given the potential benefits of meal planning identified in this study, it would be interesting that future research evaluate the appropriation and the impact of applications designed to help individuals planning their meals.", "Modified Programme National Nutrition Santé-Guideline Score", "Smith LP, Ng SW, Popkin BM.

Whilst in attendance on that body he was elected", "by the Norfolk district a member of the Convention which assembled in", "Richmond, October 5th, 1829, to revise the first Constitution of Virginia.", "In that illustrious body Mr. Tazewell made the opening speech", "in support of a resolution which he offered, and which marked out the", "course of the campaign which he believed to be best adapted to attain", "the general end in view. He engaged with conspicuous ability in the", "important discussions of the convention. His speech on the tenure of", "the judicial office is claimed to have been one of the most able efforts in", "that body of intellectual giants. Mr. Tazewell was also, in 1829,", "tendered the mission to Great Britain, but declined the honor. He", "continued in the Senate until 1833, serving as Chairman of the Committee", "on Foreign Relations, and as President pro tem. of the body during", "a portion of the twenty-second Congress.

That body had passed resolutions instructing the Senators", "from Virginia to vote for the resolutions to expunge from the journal of", "the Senate the resolutions censuring General Jackson. These instructions", "Governor Tazewell declined to approve. He was succeeded in the office of", "Governor by Lieutenant-Governor Wyndham Robertson. Mr. Tazewell", "was never afterwards in public service. Though so effective with", "juries as an advocate, his style of address is said to have been singularly", "simple and free from artifice. His arguments were conversational and", "his gestures not more striking than those of animated converse. His", "postures were negligent. His voice was pleasant and of ample compass.", "He was never vociferous. His logic was consummate, and in putting", "his arguments before a jury he exhibited great adroitness. He acquainted", "himself with the calling or prejudices of every juryman—and", "When the passions were to be assailed he indulged in a style of fervid", "appeal, which was the more effective as it was rare. Of the person of", "Mr. Tazewell, his friend and eulogist, Hugh Blair Grigsby, LL.D.,", "says: \"As soon as the visitor fixed his eyes on Mr. Tazewell, all else", "was forgotten. He was, without exception, in middle life, the most imposing,", "and in old age, the most venerable person I ever beheld. His", "height exceeded six feet. * * * His head and chest were on a large", "scale, and his vast blue eye, which always seemed to gaze afar, was aptly", "handsome. In middle life he was very thin, though lithe and strong,\"", "but in his latter days he was large of stature, with massive features,", "and hair of silvery whiteness, which fell in ringlets about his neck.", "He died at Norfolk, May 6, 1860.

Splunk makes software for searching, monitoring, and analyzing machine-generated big data for large enterprise customers and markets the product as a “Data-to-Everything Platform.”", "In the company’s fiscal year 2020 third quarter, it signed 440 new enterprise customers including Airbus, Anaplan, Carnival Cruise Lines, Crowdstrike, Lloyds Banking Group, Takeda Pharmaceuticals, University of Bristol, the U.S. Census Bureau and Xcel Energy.[ii]", "Splunk’s financials reflect their Enterprise SaaS business model. The split of revenues between SaaS and professional services is 60% to 40% and the average Annual Recurring Revenue is $78,670.[iii]", "In the private company universe, some notable Enterprise SaaS companies are cybersecurity company Kenna Security, AI-driven recruiting software provider Mya Systems, and mobile customer experience software company Swrve.", "Building an Enterprise SaaS company is a unique challenge. You need to build a product that is robust enough to handle all the unique requirements of the enterprise.", "Then you need to be able to sell-in large corporations and convince them of your value. After you close the deal, you need to provide the high touch service levels that such customers expect.", "Upfront payments help with cash flow, but Enterprise SaaS companies typically do not reach scale until about $50 million in ARR.", "As a result, these businesses require a lot more capital to succeed. However, if they succeed, they are able to capture benefits in the form of lower working capital requirements and greater customer retention, leading to high growth rates and high valuations.", "[i] We can include expansion rate in the formula either in the numerator as “1+ expansion rate” or in the denominator as net of churn.", "[ii] Splunk Investor Relations website, Splunk Inc.

(the \"Company,\" or \"Evergy\"), equating to approximately $760 million in current market value, today released a letter to Evergy's Board outlining steps which should result in high-certainty, line-of-sight equity value creation of up to $5 billion, with opportunities for significant additional value creation over time.", "According to the letter, Elliott sees a clear opportunity to achieve this significant increase in shareholder value while providing tangible benefits to all of Evergy's key stakeholders, including customers, employees and the broader communities its utilities serve.", "The letter asserts that a renewed focus on improving core utility operations and investing in Evergy's critical system infrastructure can rectify its prolonged underperformance, discounted valuation and associated increased cost of capital.", "In the letter, Elliott stated that increased system investment would not only provide meaningfully more value to shareholders than the current strategy to repurchase shares, but would also provide clearly superior benefits to Evergy's other stakeholders, help facilitate the Company's deployment of renewables and reduce its carbon footprint.", "Elliott urged Evergy to immediately explore both of the following alternative paths:", "Standalone Path: Implement High-Performance Plan with Enhanced Oversight – Develop and implement a high-performance plan with the direct input of certain new highly-credentialed Board- and management-level leadership, to increase critical infrastructure investment and optimize operating costs, leading to annual rate-base growth of up to 10% with no expected overall rate impact on customer bills.", "Combination Path: Pursue Strategic Premium Merger Transaction – Explore a strategic combination via a premium stock-for-stock merger, following which Evergy's new partner would oversee the implementation of a high-performance plan, leading to value creation in which Evergy's current shareholders would be able to participate by receiving stock in the combined entity.", "Elliott believes either path, if executed properly, should result in high-certainty, line-of-sight equity value creation of up to $5 billion, with opportunities for significant additional value creation over time.", "Elliott noted that it sought to engage the Evergy Board on a private basis in October 2019. However, in response to Elliott's outreach, the Board chose not to engage with Elliott on the merits of its suggestions but instead opted to make defensive changes to the Company's governance.", "Based on this abrupt change, Elliott determined that it would be in the best interest of all stakeholders to make public its views and facilitate a broader discussion of the best path forward for Evergy.", "The Board of Directors Evergy, Inc. 1200 Main Street Kansas City, Missouri 64105", "We are writing to you on behalf of Elliott Associates, L.P., Elliott International, L.P. and affiliates (together \"Elliott\" or \"we\").", "We have followed certain of Evergy's utility companies dating back more than 15 years. Elliott currently owns an economic interest equivalent to 11.3 million shares in Evergy, Inc. (the \"Company,\" or \"Evergy\"), approximately $760 million in market value.", "Over the past three months, we have been engaged in a private dialogue principally with Evergy management on ways to maximize value for all of Evergy's key stakeholders.", "We appreciate your time and participation in this private dialogue and, while we currently appear to have differing views on the right path forward, we are hopeful that this discussion can continue.", "We have made such a large investment in Evergy because we believe a clear opportunity exists to create significant shareholder value.", "This would lower the Company's cost of capital and provide tangible benefits to all of Evergy's key stakeholders, including customers, employees, regulators and the broader communities its utilities serve.", "We believe Evergy's valuation does not properly reflect the value of its collection of high-quality regulated utilities in Kansas and Missouri, and that a renewed focus on improving core utility operations and investing in Evergy's critical electric infrastructure can rectify its prolonged underperformance, discounted valuation and associated increased cost of capital.", "We believe that Evergy's stock-price underperformance since the completion of the Great Plains / Westar Merger (the \"Merger\") reflects investors' increasingly skeptical outlook on the Company's long-term plan and its recent strategic decisions.", "Investors are especially skeptical regarding Evergy's current strategy of using capital to repurchase shares at the expense of increased investment in its infrastructure.", "As we lay out below, increased system investment would not only provide meaningfully more value to shareholders than buybacks, but would also provide clearly superior benefits to Evergy's customers, employees, regulators and the broader communities Evergy's utilities serve, in addition to helping to facilitate the Company's deployment of renewables and reducing its carbon footprint.", "This long-term plan and current operating and strategy decisions have led to bottom-quartile (and in some instances bottom-decile) operating-cost performance, system capital investment, rate-base growth, and cost of capital among U.S. mid- and large-cap regulated utilities.", "Fortunately, we believe these strategic, operating-plan and capital-allocation issues can be addressed in the near term, allowing Evergy's utilities to become high-performing electricity providers.", "To put the Company back on a track where it can create sustainable value for all key stakeholders, Evergy should immediately explore both of the following alternative paths:", "Standalone Path: Implement High-Performance Plan with Enhanced Oversight – Develop and implement a high-performance plan with the direct input of certain new highly-credentialed Board- and management-level leadership, to increase critical infrastructure investment and optimize operating costs, leading to annual rate-base growth of up to 10% with no expected overall rate impact on customer bills.", "Combination Path: Pursue Strategic Premium Merger Transaction – Explore a strategic combination via a premium stock-for-stock merger, following which Evergy's new partner would oversee the implementation of a high-performance plan, leading to value creation in which Evergy's current shareholders would be able to participate by receiving stock in the combined entity.", "We believe either path, if executed properly, should result in high-certainty, line-of-sight equity value creation of up to $5 billion, with opportunities for significant additional value creation over time.", "In addition, we believe the business improvements envisioned under either path will leave Evergy better positioned to serve all of its key stakeholders, with stronger corporate governance and a greater commitment to renewable energy.", "The purpose of today's letter is to share our thoughts with investors on the opportunities available at Evergy to create shareholder value and provide tangible benefits to its key stakeholders and constituent communities.", "Given our interactions with management and the Board to date as well as Evergy's persistent share-price underperformance, we believe the time has come for a full public discussion regarding the best path forward for Evergy.", "We have organized our thoughts in the following manner:", "(i) Elliott's Investment in Evergy; (ii) Evergy's Collection of High-Quality Regulated Utilities; (iii) Evergy's Current Plan and Resulting Underperformance; (iv) Opportunity for Value Creation at Evergy; (v) High-Performance Paths Forward for Evergy; and (vi) Next Steps.", "Elliott is a multi-strategy investment firm that was founded in 1977 and has more than $40 billion in assets under management today.", "We have a strong track record of investing in the power, utility and energy sectors and working with companies to create long-term stakeholder value.", "We first approached management and the Board on a private basis in early October 2019 and hoped to work privately to identify the best path forward for Evergy.", "However, in response to our outreach, the Board chose not to engage with us on the merits of our suggestions but instead opted to make defensive changes to the Company's governance.", "Based on this abrupt change to the Company's governance, limiting the ability of shareholders to nominate and elect directors, as well as a lack of progress toward the exploration of any value-maximizing operational and/or strategic alternatives, we determined that it would be in the best interest of all stakeholders to make our views public and facilitate a broader discussion of the best path forward for Evergy.", "Evergy's Collection of High-Quality Regulated Utilities", "Evergy is composed of three coveted regulated utilities in constructive regulatory jurisdictions. With the right stakeholder-focused capital plan and an operating strategy centered around enhanced system investment to bolster safety, reliability, customer service, security and renewables, Evergy can become a highly valued utility with a lower cost of capital.", "This should result in Evergy's rate-base and earnings growth coming at least in-line with other leading regulated electric utilities in nearby states in the Midwest, West, Southwest and Southeast regions of the U.S.", "Notable features that distinguish Evergy from certain other utility companies include:", "High-quality regulated utilities: Evergy is a collection of high-quality, 100% regulated utilities across two states – Kansas and Missouri.", "Regulatory certainty with constructive regulatory backdrop: Evergy's current multi-year regulatory agreements in Kansas and Missouri provide an extended period of regulatory and rate certainty.", "Strong core investment growth opportunities: Evergy has the continued opportunity to increase core system capital spending in areas that will lead to hardening, modernization, enhanced safety, reliability, security and customer service performance metrics, all on a rate-friendly basis to customers.", "Strong investment opportunities around renewables: Evergy's advantageous geographic location in the wind corridor of the U.S. should provide ample capital deployment opportunities across its business – in transmission and distribution to facilitate greater renewables penetration, and in generation to transition Evergy's aging coal fleet to renewable energy.", "Strong financial metrics: Evergy has moderate overall financial leverage with no need to issue equity in the near term.", "However, the Company's use of over $3.5 billion to repurchase shares has already somewhat weakened Evergy's holding company balance sheet and increased leverage by ~1.5x, thereby limiting overall flexibility and ability to maintain a proactive strategic posture.", "No overhangs: Evergy is not exposed to merchant generation, foreign subsidiaries, mega-project construction risk or other unregulated businesses.", "Evergy's Current Plan and Resulting Underperformance", "Despite its positive base business and broader environmental attributes, Evergy has meaningfully underperformed peers, resulting in a notable undervaluation and associated increased cost of capital.", "Since the Merger, Evergy's total shareholder return (\"TSR\") has lagged similarly situated Midwest electric utility peers by 25 percentage points.1", "While Evergy was valued at a slight premium to peers on a P/E basis for several months following the Merger, it is now valued at a significant discount.", "See \"Evergy Underperformance Since Completion of Merger\" charts.", "We believe the key reasons for Evergy's underperformance, discounted valuation and associated increased cost of capital can be clearly explained and grouped into two categories:", "1) Suboptimal Plan and Strategy: Evergy's current capital plan and operating strategy have led to justifiable concerns around the Company's ability to create long-term value on a standalone basis.", "2) Loss of Management and Board Credibility: Operating issues at Great Plains as well as continued operating, accountability and communications issues since the Merger have further eroded investor confidence at Evergy.", "Following the Merger, Evergy implemented a unique strategy premised on using cash flow and excess capital to repurchase shares rather than driving sustainable value creation by making critical long-term system investments.", "Specifically, Evergy's current business plan relies on holding rate base growth to 2-3% for multiple years while relying on share buybacks to manufacture near-term growth in earnings per share.", "The math demonstrating why this strategy is suboptimal for Evergy shareholders is simple: Based on average authorized returns on equity, $1 of equity capital invested in rate base for most utilities can earn significantlymore than double the return of $1 used to buy back stock.", "As a result, $1 invested in rate base is worth approximately $2.40 to shareholders, while $1 in share buybacks merely distributes $1 back to shareholders.2", "See \"Shareholder Value Creation Comparison\" charts.", "Following completion of the Merger, Evergy's decision to use $3.5 billion of capital to buy back stock instead of using that capital to make system investments will cause utility stakeholders to forego meaningful tangible benefits and translates into approximately $4 billion of shareholder value destruction.", "Unsurprisingly, Evergy is an outlier in pursuing this unusual capital-allocation strategy, as other major utilities in the U.S. have sought to invest in critical infrastructure for the benefit of the customers and communities they serve, while minimizing the impact on customer bills by improving efficiency.", "Indeed, there simply is no recent evidence of value creation in the regulated utility industry from maneuvers such as large-scale levered share-repurchase programs.", "Evergy's resulting rate-base growth trajectory is worst-in-class among peers, despite the clear system investment opportunities available to the Company.", "The map below throws the contrast between Evergy and its peers into stark relief:", "See \"Rate Base Growth of Nerby Regulated Utilities\" map.", "Evergy's low rate base growth and its overreliance on share buybacks have created deep concerns among investors over Evergy's long-term growth outlook and its ability to create value after the share buybacks are completed in mid-2020.", "These concerns have been highlighted by the equity-research analyst community:", "\"So these updates put in to question not only the near term earnings profile…but also the L-T growth profile of the company after the financial engineering associated with their share buyback and synergy harvesting from the merger runs its course.\"", "\"Longer term, EVRG has regulatory certainty with 4-5 year rate case stay outs in Missouri/Kansas, but there are concerns around earnings power given very modest rate base growth .\" – Wolfe, 8/8/19", "These research analysts have followed Evergy (and its predecessor companies) for years. Their views are therefore shaped by deep institutional knowledge of Evergy and generally reflect the views of its shareholders.", "This lack of confidence in Evergy's current direction is perhaps best illustrated by the fact that Evergy received two separate downgrades by equity research analysts shortly after management presented its business plan at the EEI conference in mid-November 2019.", "Evergy's performance has been further hampered by consistently subpar execution, representing a continuation of the poor track record of Great Plains prior to the Merger:", "Consistent Under-Earning: During the Evergy senior team's tenure at Great Plains, its utilities failed to consistently earn their authorized ROEs and routinely under-earned by 100-200 basis points.", "This stands in stark contrast to the vast majority of U.S. regulated utilities, including those in Kansas and Missouri, which have been able to earn their authorized returns on equity.", "Earning at authorized levels is critical for a utility's ability to achieve access to plentiful, low-cost capital.", "Failed LBO Attempt of Westar: In 2017, Great Plains, a $5 billion market cap company at the time, attempted to acquire Westar at a 36% premium for $8.6 billion in a highly leveraged 85% cash / 15% stock transaction.", "The transaction was widely criticized by virtually all Great Plains stakeholders, including shareholders, ratepayer advocates and regulators, all of whom expressed grave concerns about the leverage used in the transaction.", "The Kansas Corporation Commission roundly rejected the transaction, noting that the transaction would leave the new entity with \"little financial flexibility and very little margin of error.\"", "Although Great Plains and Westar ultimately consummated a revised, all-stock transaction, Great Plains' aggressive, ill-conceived attempted leveraged buyout of Westar unnecessarily extended the timeline of the transaction and led to heightened regulatory scrutiny.", "While investors were hopeful that Evergy would have a fresh start, the record of subpar execution at Great Plains unfortunately has carried over to the combined Company, as evidenced by issues that have emerged since the Merger:", "Negative Guidance Revision: In February 2019, Evergy reported a meaningful earnings miss and lowered rate-base growth guidance from an already meager 3-4% down to 2-3%.", "This shift in the growth trajectory of the Company only nine months following the completion of the Merger led to widespread investor frustration and further management and Board accountability and credibility issues.", "Regulatory Issues: Continued regulatory issues related to the Sibley coal plant retirement and Jeffrey Energy Center stake acquisition again raised the specter of under-earning, despite regulatory certainty provided by rate stay-outs.", "Additionally, it appears the Sibley issue was self-inflicted and could have been avoided by fully settling the issue as part of the 2018 rate case.", "Inadequate Carbon Reduction Targets: Evergy's intention of operating its coal plants until the end of their useful lives (2040-2050) is uninspired and economically inefficient.", "Evergy lags behind leading peers that have pledged to reduce carbon emissions by 70-80% by 2030 and achieve net zero emissions by 2050.", "Investors have been keenly aware of Evergy's issues, as evidenced by declining ownership in Evergy by large active stock managers:", "See \"Evergy Share Ownership By Selected Large Active Managers\" chart.", "Nor have these issues gone unnoticed by the analysts who follow the Company:", "\"The management track record here is checkered with regard to delivering consistent financial results—more so on the GXP side of the house than the WR side—and the market reaction to the financial update is in part a function of skepticism that the newly merged companies will have to fight to overcome.\"", "\"Entering 2019, we considered EVRG to be a relatively low risk/high visibility play…that narrative changed, however, on the year-end earnings call as management talked down the growth rate through 2021…and laid out lackluster rate base growth of 2-3% through 2023.", "We were most disappointed by the 2021 guidance revision as that was the first target established for the merger of equals, representing the first critical step to building a track record as EVRG.\"", "The unfortunate result of these missed targets, mishandled regulatory issues and other execution missteps has been a profound loss of investor confidence and an unwillingness on the part of the investment community to invest behind this management team and Board.", "Current and prospective shareholders see this fact pattern and cannot help but conclude that Evergy's leadership team places little emphasis on providing shareholders with a strong value-proposition to buy and hold Evergy stock.", "There is a strong case to be made that a combination of changes in direction and oversight are needed to restore investor confidence and remedy the Company's chronic underperformance.", "We believe robust investment in critical system infrastructure forms the foundation of the investor-owned utility model.", "U.S. regulated utilities are granted a monopoly franchise with authorized rates of return in order to access abundant low-cost capital to make critical infrastructure investments.", "The purpose of this model is to benefit customers, create opportunities for employees, and achieve various community objectives, including boosting local economic growth.", "Evergy's current strategy of limiting system investment and instead using excess capital to repurchase shares is both suboptimal and runs counter to the regulatory compact.", "System investment is in fact encouraged by Evergy's regulators. In 2018, the Missouri legislature passed Senate Bill 564 (\"SB 564\") to encourage additional investment in the state's electrical grid.", "Missouri Public Service Commission Chairman Ryan Silvey recently commented in a conference call for the investment community: \"We expect to see some capital invested in the grid, which was the point of the legislation.", "So we're hopeful that it results in a lot of upgrades to the grid. That's something that we are in need of.\"", "Since the passage of SB 564, both of Missouri's other investor-owned utilities, Ameren and Empire District Electric, have announced the largest capital plans in their respective companies' histories.", "Ameren expects to grow Missouri rate base at an 8% CAGR, and Empire District Electric expects to grow rate base at a 12% CAGR.", "Evergy has significant runway to make much-needed investments in critical electric infrastructure across its system, including in the key areas of safety and reliability, grid hardening and modernization, and physical and cybersecurity infrastructure.", "Additionally, because of the strength of the wind resource in Evergy's service territory, Evergy stands to be a leader in de-carbonization system investments that facilitate renewables growth and help transition its coal fleet (which still accounts for 40% of its generation capacity) to renewable resources.", "To frame the opportunity, the U.S. Department of Energy estimates Kansas and Missouri have potential for 785 GW of wind capacity compared to 7 GW installed today.3", "Evergy should reasonably be able to create more than$700 million of high-certainty, line-of-sight, balanced rate headroom, on a standalone basis to support incremental system investment based on:", "1) More than $250 million of non-generation operating & maintenance (\"O&M\") efficiencies;", "2) More than $200 million of generation-related fuel and non-fuel O&M savings from replacing only a small portion (~20%) of remaining inefficient coal generation with renewables; and", "3) Up to $250 million of rate headroom within the 3% annual limitation imposed by SB 564.", "See \"Illustrative Evergy Rate Headroom and Usage\" chart.", "As $1 of rate headroom can be translated into $8-$9 of rate base investment, deploying just $500 million of the above-identified annual rate headroom should result in an additional $4.5 billion of rate base by 2023 compared to Evergy's current plan.", "Because the bulk of the investment program is funded with ongoing fuel and O&M cost savings rather than rate increases, the overall annualized rate impact to customers is expected to be well below the rate of inflation and likely overall rate neutral.4", "Non-Generation O&M Efficiencies: Benchmarking Evergy's non-generation O&M performance against similarly-situated U.S. regulated utilities shows clear evidence that Evergy operates with a bottom-quartile controllable cost structure, with unit costs nearly 50% higher than the median and 80% higher than top-quartile.", "The fact that Evergy is one of the highest-cost utilities in the U.S. is surprising given that the cost of living in its service territory is below the national average.", "Improving Evergy's cost structure from bottom-quartile to not even the median would result in incremental savings of more than $350 million and create more than$250 million in additional headroom above and beyond Evergy's anticipated Merger savings.5 We anticipate that these cost savings would be achieved in the next few years.", "See \"Evergy Unit Non-Generation O&M Comparison\" chart.", "Generation-Related Fuel and Non-Fuel O&M Savings: Transitioning a portion of Evergy's environmentally unfriendly, high-cost coal generation to new renewables generation should yield significant savings in fuel and non-fuel O&M.
