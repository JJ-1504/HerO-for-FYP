Released June 18, 2019", "In Q1 2019, the U.S. solar market installed 2.7 gigawatts direct current (GWdc) of solar photovoltaic (PV) capacity, a 10% increase year-over-year and the strongest Q1 in the industry’s history.", "After a year in which the residential sector grew 8%, the rebound continued, with the sector experiencing a third consecutive quarter with more than 600 MWdc added.", "Conversely, non-residential PV suffered both quarterly and annual declines due to policy transitions and interconnection issues in key markets.", "The quarter was buoyed by 1.6 GW of utility-scale installations, with new project procurement growing the contracted pipeline to nearly 28 GW.", "Across all market segments, solar PV accounted for 51% of all new electricity generating capacity additions in Q1 2019.", "Further, solar surpassed the 2 million installation milestone in Q1 2019, after reaching the first million just three years ago in 2016.", "After growing 8 percent in 2018, the residential solar market grew 5% on a year-over-year basis and is effectively tied for the second-largest quarter since Q4 2016.", "Since bottoming out in Q3 2017, quarterly growth in five of the last six quarters suggests that the market is adopting a more sustainable growth profile, with a mix of local and regional installers operating alongside national installers.", "However, state markets with higher penetration levels and increasing customer-acquisition costs continue to struggle with flat or declining installations on a quarterly basis.", "The continued emergence of new markets has helped to sustain robust installation volumes nationally.", "Unlike the residential market, a handful of state-specific regulatory cliffs and policy reforms that took effect in 2018 continued to impact non-residential installations in Q1 2019.", "Major policy reforms in the core non-residential markets of California and Massachusetts are still hampering development.", "In the case of California, installations were flat on both a year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter basis, which suggests that installation declines stemming from the transition to new time-of-use rates may be abating.", "Massachusetts is still being negatively impacted by the transition to its new incentive program, which has slowed most non-residential development.", "As the state transitions to the new SMART program, utility interconnection approvals for qualified projects are taking much longer than anticipated, leaving most projects waiting months, if not years, to interconnect and begin earning SMART tariff revenue.", "This has resulted in market declines on both a year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter basis.", "Utility PV maintained the largest share of installations in the U.S. solar market this quarter – 1.6 GWdc of utility PV capacity came online in Q1 2019, representing 61% of quarterly capacity additions.", "With 4.7 GWdc of projects under construction, 2019 is on track to be a strong year for utility PV, with 46% growth over 2018 expected.", "After a record 15.0 GWdc of U.S. utility solar was procured in 2018, new project announcements have slowed slightly in 2019 but levels still remain healthy.", "As of May 2019, 3.8 GW have been procured, pushing the contracted pipeline to 27.7 GW. The growth is primarily due to a 1.5 GWdc announcement from Florida Power & Light and 1.1 GWdc announced by Duke Energy in the Carolinas.", "Florida Power & Light’s development of its own solar projects makes up the bulk of Florida’s five-year forecast, with additional announcements from Duke Florida, Teco Energy and Jacksonville Electric expected to add to the pipeline in that state.", "Voluntary procurement of utility PV based on its economic competitiveness continues to be the primary driver of projects announced in 2019.", "While many states, utilities and cities have announced or proposed 50% or 100% renewable energy or zero-carbon standards, the announcements have not yet resulted in an uptick in RPS-driven procurement.", "Corporate procurement of utility solar drove 22% of projects announced in 2018 and continues apace in 2019, with 14% of projects announced having a corporate offtaker.", "(Wood Mackenzie classifies large offsite projects with C&I offtakers as utility-scale rather than distributed due to the size and structure of the deals.)", "As the number of corporations pledging to use 100% renewable power continues to grow, corporate procurement is expected to remain a strong driver of utility PV.", "Despite steady installations in Q1 2019, the residential market is still highly reliant on legacy state markets, such as California and the Northeast, which have seen only modest to flat growth over the past several quarters.", "As these major state markets continue to grow past early-adopter consumers, higher costs of customer acquisition will challenge the industry to innovate product offerings and diversify geographically.", "Indeed, 29% of residential capacity in Q1 2019 came from markets outside the top 10 (by cumulative capacity), the highest share for emerging markets in industry history.", "From 2019-2021, residential growth will range from 5%-20% due to both emerging markets with strong resource fundamentals like Florida and Texas, and markets where recent policy developments have increased our near-term forecasts.", "Maryland’s recent renewable portfolio standard increase, the removal of South Carolina’s net metering cap, and new incentive programs such as Illinois’ Adjustable Block Program will provide significant upside and growth to our residential forecasts over the next few years.", "Meanwhile, California’s new home solar mandate will also help to offset market penetration challenges beginning in 2020.", "In the long term, the ITC step-down is expected to pull in demand in both legacy and emerging markets before declining in 2022.", "Growth resumes in 2023 and continues into 2024 based on economic fundamentals as the market adjusts to post-ITC market conditions.", "That said, long-term growth in a post-ITC world will be contingent on geographic diversification outside of legacy state markets and technological/business-model innovation to improve product offerings in solar-plus-storage.", "Non-residential installation totals in Q1 2019 were the weakest since Q1 2017 as all three major state markets (California, Massachusetts and Minnesota) saw declining volumes due to state-level policy reforms and interconnection delays that continue to limit development opportunities.", "Overall, the non-residential PV market is on track for another down year as the segment acclimates to a reduced incentive environment across major state markets.", "However, this will be incrementally offset starting in 2020 as the next wave of states with robust community solar mandates – New York, Maryland, Illinois and New Jersey – experience growth.", "Furthermore, recent policy developments in New York and Maryland will ultimately provide for growth in our long-term outlook.", "Significant revisions to the Value of Distributed Energy Resources (VDER) docket in New York have bolstered our long-term forecasts for both commercial and community solar, while an RPS increase in Maryland will boost the sagging SREC market to the benefit of the entire non-residential segment.", "Increasing solar-plus-storage viability will also begin to have an impact on non-residential demand as policymakers and business leaders increasingly consider energy storage in their decisions.", "New York’s recent development of the Bridge Incentive increases our long-term solar-plus-storage forecasts with further potential upside.", "By 2023, roughly 30% of total non-residential PV will come from community solar, and ~20% will come from solar-plus-storage projects.", "The U.S. utility solar forecast for 2019-2024 has grown by 5.1 GWdc since last quarter. The largest contributor is an increase to Florida’s five-year outlook from 6.0 GWdc to 9.0 GWdc due to new solar procurement by Florida Power & Light (FPL), Duke Energy Florida, and other Florida utilities (most of which is utility self-build).", "This positions Florida to be the top state for utility PV over the next six years.", "Since last quarter, the 2019 forecast has grown by 1.2 GW, due largely to late project announcements in Texas that raised the state’s forecast by 720 MWdc.", "While the forecast for 2020 saw little change to overall expected capacity additions, over 10.0 GWdc of utility PV are still expected to come online that year.", "From 2021-2023, our utility PV forecast has increased by 2.8 GWdc. While the bulk of this increase is found in Florida, there are a growing number of utilities such as Xcel Energy, Idaho Power and PacifiCorp, among others, announcing additional solar procurement, expedited coal plant retirement, or plans to achieve 50% to 100% renewable or carbon-free energy targets, all of which have boosted the midterm forecast.", "During this time, utility PV also becomes increasingly competitive with wind. As the wind-focused federal Production Tax Credit steps down, solar begins to fall below the cost of wind on a levelized cost of energy (LCOE) basis in many traditional wind states such as Illinois, Iowa, Kansas, Michigan and the Dakotas by the mid-2020s.", "(Wood Mackenzie’s LCOE calculations for solar take the ITC incentive into account.) This is likely not only to drive more solar procurement in wind-dominant regions of Midcontinent Independent System Operator and Southwest Power Pool, but also to make solar the preferred renewable technology for corporate offtakers.", "Oklahoma Gas & Electric’s recent RFP for solar-plus-storage is the first example of what is likely to be a trend in solar procurement in the Prairies and Midwest.", "Our 2024 forecast has also increased by 1.1 GWdc. Many utilities such as Dominion, Tennessee Valley Authority and FPL have outlined solar procurement plans for 2024 and beyond.", "Despite the ITC having fully stepped down to 10% by that time, utility PV will remain economically competitive with new-build wind and natural gas in many places.", "We employ a bottom-up modeling methodology to track and report national average PV system pricing for the major market segments.", "This methodology is based on tracked wholesale pricing of major solar components and data collected from interviews with major installers.", "In Q1 2019, system pricing fell in all market segments. System pricing fell by 3.0%, 2.7%, 0.1% and 0.1% in the residential, non-residential, utility fixed-tilt and utility single-axis tracking markets, respectively.", "Prices across market segments are now all at historic lows despite tariffs on modules, inverters, aluminum and steel: $2.89/Wdc, $1.47/Wdc, $0.93/Wdc and $1.04/Wdc for residential, non-residential, utility fixed-tilt and utility single-axis tracking systems, respectively.", "Year-over-year system pricing fell by 6.8%, 9.8%, 12.6% and 12.9% in the residential, non-residential, utility fixed-tilt and utility single-axis tracking markets, respectively.", "U.S. solar market insightÂ® is a quarterly publication of Wood Mackenzie Power & Renewables, Inc. d/b/a Greentech Media and the Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA)Â®.", "Each quarter, we collect granular data on the U.S. solar market from nearly 200 utilities, state agencies, installers and manufacturers.", "This data provides the backbone of this U.S. solar market insightÂ® report, in which we identify and analyze trends in U.S. solar demand, manufacturing and pricing by state and market segment.", "We also use this analysis to look forward and forecast demand over the next five years. All forecasts are from Wood Mackenzie, Limited; SEIA does not predict future pricing, bid terms, costs, deployment or supply.", "Our coverage in these reports includes 43 individual states and Washington, D.C. However, the national totals reported include all 50 states, Washington, D.C. and Puerto Rico.", "The U.S. solar market insightÂ® is offered in two versions – the Executive Summary and the Full Report.", "The Executive Summary is free, and the Full Report is available individually each quarter or as part of an annual subscription.", "Detailed data and forecasts by state are available in the Full Report. To find out more, click here.", "Note on U.S. solar market insight report title: WM P&R and SEIA have changed the naming convention for the U.S. solar market insight report series.", "Starting with the report released in June 2016 onward, the report title will reference the quarter in which the report is released, as opposed to the most recent quarter in which installation figures are tracked.", "The exception will be our year in review publication, which covers the preceding year’s installation volumes despite being released during the first quarter of the current year."]}

Released March 13, 2019", "In 2018, the U.S. solar market installed 10.6 gigawatts direct current (GWdc) of solar photovoltaic (PV) capacity, a 2% decline from capacity additions in 2017.", "After a year in which the residential sector experienced 15% contraction, 2018 marked a year of rebound as the residential market grew by 7%.", "Conversely, non-residential PV saw a slight annual decline of 8%. Utility solar also saw slight annual contraction, due to the impacts of Section 201 tariff uncertainty earlier in the year and shifting project timelines based on the tariff schedule.", "Overall, in 2018, solar PV has accounted for 29% of new electricity generating capacity additions – a lower share compared to 2017 due to a surge in new natural-gas plants in early 2018.", "After experiencing volume contraction last year, the residential solar market regained its footing in 2018 with steadily increasing installation volumes.", "The fourth quarter of 2018 was the largest quarter for the residential segment in two years. Five quarters of modest growth now suggest the market is adopting a more sustainable growth profile with a mix of local and regional installers operating alongside national installers.", "With 2018 in the books, a few key themes have emerged about the state of the residential solar market.", "Installation growth and market penetration levels suggest major states have moved past early adopters.", "Among the highest-penetration markets in the nation, residential growth rates were mixed in 2018. The one exception to this was Nevada, which experienced 3x growth once net metering was reinstated in 2017 after being revoked in 2016, which caused the market to contract by 61% from 2016 to 2017.This political turmoil led to abnormally high installations in 2018 based on pent-up demand.", "Outside the stabilizing large markets, growth in low-penetration emerging markets, such as Texas and Florida, continues to add to the geographic diversity of the residential market outside of California and the Northeast.", "Legacy markets are no longer the primary engines of growth. Though California is forecasted to be the largest market for the foreseeable future due to the sheer size of the state, the regional growth landscape began to shift and diversify in 2018.", "Of the top 10 markets in 2017, six markets experienced annual contraction in 2018 while two experienced double-digit percentage growth.", "Meanwhile, a handful of states are leapfrogging developed markets. Both Texas and Florida saw installations that surpassed legacy markets Maryland and Massachusetts last year, signaling new state-level leadership on residential solar development.", "In 2018, we saw a pivot away from legacy, incentive-driven markets and the emergence of low-penetration markets with limited third-party ownership options, good PV resources, and low electricity rates – a trend we expect to continue.", "Residential PV continues to be constrained by high costs of customer acquisition. Outside of overhead and margin, customer-acquisition costs remain the highest expense for installers of all sizes averaging 20% of the total system pricing.", "This reaffirms our view that at existing prices, sales and marketing is a vital part of continued residential market development.", "High customer-acquisition costs are directly related to high overall cost of installation, which also suggests a virtuous cycle of reduced costs.", "One target area for the industry to reduce costs is through streamlining the permitting and inspection processes, as permitting delays lead to customer attrition and other expenses.", "SEIA and the Solar Foundation, along with numerous companies, are working together to address these issues.", "New construction and roof replacement markets also represent an opportunity to address both customer-acquisition and permitting costs.", "However, at existing price levels, the high cost of customer-acquisition will slow growth in the near-term.", "Incentives and net metering remain important market enablers but show diminishing rates of return. While utility attempts to roll back net metering have been an issue in years past, this was not the case in 2018.", "No substantial revisions were made to residential NEM values in 2018 other than in Connecticut. In prior years, impending changes to NEM, other state-level incentives, or rate structures have created demand pull-in.", "Despite anticipated changes to incentives and NEM in 2019-2020, the major Northeast markets collectively saw no growth in installation volumes.", "This suggests that while changes to NEM policy and other incentives have greatly impacted growth in years past, 2018 marks a year of market maturation.", "While strong NEM policy remains an essential foundation for rooftop solar adoption, future growth across legacy markets will require technology and business-model innovation to tap into new customer demographics.", "Meanwhile, California’s new home solar mandate may signal the next phase of solar market adoption. The California Energy Commission’s decision in early 2018 to require solar PV on all new homes beginning in 2020 significantly insulates our long-term forecasts by adding an additional gigawatt of residential demand from 2020-2024E. While it remains to be seen whether other states will follow suit, some municipalities have created solar mandates for new buildings.", "Meanwhile, major national installers are spending considerable resources building relationships with housing developers to comply with California’s mandate while also aiming to capitalize on one-off housing developments outside of state mandates.", "With several newly announced entrants into the space, new home solar, whether mandated or voluntary, could provide an opportunity to bridge the cost of customer acquisition gap that has constrained growth.", "Unlike the case of residential PV, a handful of state-specific regulatory cliffs and policy reforms took effect in 2018, which led to a decline in non-residential build-out in the major markets of California and Massachusetts.", "Despite California’s market falling 17% year-over-year, the decline was not as severe as previously anticipated, as the extent of California’s pipeline of projects grandfathered in under solar-friendly time-of-use rates has been higher than previously assumed.", "However, Massachusetts witnessed 64% year-over-year decline in capacity installed as the industry awaited the start of the Solar Massachusetts Renewable Target (SMART) program.", "Combined, these two states saw a year-over-year decrease of more than 450 MW of installed non-residential PV capacity.", "New York bucked the national trend, experiencing record installations in 2018. This was the result of a waning pipeline of grandfathered remote net-metering projects becoming interconnected, despite being constructed in 2017.", "Meanwhile, community solar continues to support non-residential PV. Minnesota and Massachusetts contributed to well over 500 MW of community solar being installed this year.", "And while we won’t begin to see projects from New Jersey’s new community solar program until late 2019 at the earliest, the state is making significant strides in establishing the program, which technically kicks off in Q1 2019.", "Utility PV continues to hold the largest share of annual installations in the U.S. solar market with a total of 6.2 GWdc in 2018, accounting for 58% of total U.S. annual capacity additions.", "Lower-than-expected installation volumes in Q4 are primarily attributed to Section 201 module tariffs set in January 2018 and implemented in February 2018, which caused project sponsors to reassess a handful of project timelines and push out target commercial operation dates (CODs) from 2018 into 2019.", "In addition to tariff-related delays, interconnection delays for PURPA projects in the Carolinas contributed to lower-than-expected Q4 deployments.", "U.S. utility solar procurement has grown considerably with a number of utilities, such as Hawaiian Electric Company and Entergy Mississippi, announcing plans to add more utility PV to their generation portfolios due to the pure economic competitiveness of solar.", "In 2018, 13.2 GWdc of utility solar PPAs were signed, driving the contracted pipeline to 28.3 GWdc – the highest point in the history of U.S. solar.", "Most of these PPAs will be fulfilled with products imported after significant declines in the Section 201 tariffs.", "Voluntary procurement remains the largest driver of new PPAs signed and is expected to drive 51% of 2019 capacity additions.", "While commercial and industrial (C&I) off takers only accounted for 153 MW of actual capacity additions in 2018, C&I procurement drove 21% of all new PPAs signed last year.", "Meanwhile, new renewable portfolio standards are poised to drive additional utility PV.", "Many utility PV projects suffered disruption, delay and even cancelation due to the uncertainty leading up to the imposition of the Section 201 tariffs.", "The impacts can be seen in the volume of installations in 2018, which were down 7% year-over-year for utility-scale PV.", "However, since the tariffs were announced, the industry has pushed out timelines to account for the tariff stepdown schedule and has benefited from faster-than-expected declines in global module pricing.", "These price declines are mostly due to changes in China’s feed-in tariff policy that has resulted in a supply glut.", "While the Section 201 tariffs are still imposing a significant opportunity cost on the U.S. solar industry, new project procurement is moving forward thanks to strong industry fundamentals.", "Cell and module tariffs dropped from 30% to 25% in February 2019. Tariffs will drop to 20% in February 2020 and 15% in February 2021 before their scheduled expiration in February 2022.", "The International Trade Commission (ITC) will conduct a mid-term review of the tariffs starting in January 2020, at which point the President will have the opportunity to continue, modify, or terminate the tariffs.", "The ITC will begin data collection for that review this summer.", "Residential installation growth exceeded expectations for 2018, largely thanks to strong showings in California, Nevada and Florida.", "Still, as major state markets continue to grow past early-adopter consumers, higher costs of customer acquisition will challenge the industry to innovate.", "Long-term growth prospects benefit from (among other factors): geographic diversification outside of legacy state markets, California’s new home solar mandate, new incentive programs such as Illinois’ Adjustable Block Program, and technological/business model innovation to improve product offerings into solar-plus-storage.", "In 2018, the non-residential sector benefited from a large pipeline of projects grandfathered in under more favorable compensation policies in California and Massachusetts.", "California experienced commercial solar build-out in 2018, stemming from developers rushing to install projects to meet a (since-lifted) deadline to be grandfathered in under solar-friendly time-of-use rates.", "Meanwhile, New York saw its largest year ever for commercial installations as the remaining pipeline of remote net-metering projects came online.", "However, the delayed opening of the SMART program in Massachusetts resulted in that state seeing 325 MW less capacity installed in 2018 than in the record-breaking 2017.", "Additionally, the build-out of Xcel Energy’s robust community solar pipeline in Minnesota still accounts for a significant share of non-residential growth, with nearly 300 MWdc added in 2018.", "In total, Minnesota accounted for over 80% of the community solar build-out in 2018, while Massachusetts accounted for much of the remainder.", "Though the community solar market didn’t quite outpace 2017 capacity, last year marked the second consecutive year of over 500 MW of community solar installed.", "Utility PV continues to hold the largest share of annual installations in the U.S. solar market. In Q4 2018, 3.0 GWdc of utility PV capacity came online boosting the annual total to 6.2 GWdc in 2018.", "These additions represented 72% of total Q4 capacity and 58% of total U.S. capacity additions for the year.", "Lower-than-expected installation volumes in Q4 can be primarily attributed to two factors. The module tariffs set in January 2018 caused a handful of projects to reassess project timelines and push out target completed operation dates (CODs) from 2018 into 2019.", "Additionally, a handful of PURPA projects in the Carolinas have faced interconnection delays or have been outright canceled as utilities push back against standard rate agreements.", "U.S. utility solar market procurement has grown considerably, largely set for years when tariffs have decreased.", "Many utilities like Tennessee Valley Authority, Georgia Power and Northern Indiana Public Service Co., have announced plans to add more utility PV to their generation portfolios.", "With 13.2 GWdc of utility solar PPAs signed in 2018, the contracted pipeline peaked in Q3 2018 at 25.3 GWdc, the highest in the history of U.S. solar, and declined slightly in Q4 as project completion outpaced new PPAs signed.", "We employ a bottom-up modeling methodology to track and report national average PV system pricing for the major market segments.", "This methodology is based on tracked wholesale pricing of major solar components and data collected from interviews with major installers.", "Note: Detailed information about national system prices by market segment and component is available in the full report.", "In Q4 2018, system pricing fell in all market segments. Quarter-over-quarter, system pricing fell by 1.3%, 1.1%, 3.3% and 3.9% in the residential, non-residential, utility fixed-tilt and utility single-axis tracking markets, respectively.", "Prices across market segments are now all at historic lows despite tariffs on modules, inverters, aluminum and steel: $2.98/Wdc, $1.51/Wdc, $0.93/Wdc and $1.04/Wdc for residential, non-residential, utility fixed-tilt and utility single-axis tracking systems, respectively.", "Year-over-year system pricing fell by 4%, 8.5%, 15.1% and 14.4% in the residential, non-residential, utility fixed-tilt and utility single-axis tracking markets, respectively.", "Price declines continue to be led by declining hardware costs, with much of the reduction coming in module pricing.", "Cuts to demand in China last June created global module over-supply conditions that led to lower module prices, somewhat mitigating the impacts of module tariffs in the U.S.", "The tariffs still, however, impose an opportunity cost on the U.S. industry, which cannot fully take advantage of pricing available to the rest of the world.", "After modest decline in 2018, the national solar PV market will resume growth in 2019-2020, primarily driven by continued growth in the residential segment and a rebound in the utility PV sector.", "For utility PV, the downside to our 2018 forecasts benefits 2019 – the 2019 forecast has been increased from 7.2 GWdc to 7.8 GWdc as projects have pushed out target completion dates, and 2.1 GWdc of capacity is already under construction.", "The forecasts for 2020 and 2021 have increased to 10 and 10.4 GWdc, respectively. Of the projects announced in 2019, 68% have 2020 or 2021 target CODs, significantly boosting confidence in the near-term forecast.", "And we expect to see at least half of 2023 capacity additions leverage a 22% or higher ITC. Finally, growth will continue into 2024, driven by current utility IRPs for solar capacity along with the economic fundamentals of utility solar projects.", "After examining the risks of advanced procurement, many project developers now seem more open to anchoring projects in 2019 to claim the 30% ITC and bringing them online in 2021 or later.", "Still, several developers have suggested they will assess each project on a case-by-case basis.", "Commercial and industrial procurement is expected to remain a strong driver of utility solar over the next several years as the number of companies pledging to meet 100% renewables or zero-carbon targets increases.", "Renewable portfolio standards (RPSs) are also poised to see a resurgence as a driver of utility PV. Many of the newly elected governors are in states that have joined the U.S. Climate Alliance or campaigned on a pledge to join the Alliance and commit to the Paris Agreement in lieu of federal participation.", "Six of the governors have proposed increases to RPS targets, while three (Colorado, Nevada, and Illinois) have proposed 100% RPS mandates.", "This is in addition to California’s 100% RPS, Hawaii’s 100% RPS, and New York’s 50% RPS. If all states where elected governors campaigned on RPS increases were to achieve 50% RPS compliance by 2030, it could drive up to 37.0 GWdc of additional solar.", "Wood Mackenzie’s utility PV five-year forecast has increased 2.3 GWdc since our last report as more projects are announced, utilities include more solar in long-term resource planning, and development is driven increasingly by C&I offtakers.", "For residential PV, after seeing 7% growth in 2018, we expect flat to tempered growth in 2019, primarily due to major market maturation resulting in limited long-term growth opportunities in major Northeast markets.", "Meanwhile, the approval of a super off-peak rate in Southern California Edison territory – the second-largest utility in the nation for solar PV – takes effect in 2019, which severely limits the economic attractiveness of solar-only products.", "That said, growth resumes in 2020-2021 as the ITC step-down is expected to pull in demand in both legacy and emerging markets before declining in 2022.", "Growth resumes in 2023 and continues into 2024 based on economic fundamentals as the market adjusts to the post-ITC reality.", "In the long-term, residential capacity growth will be driven by California’s new home solar mandate – with upside potential from other states adopting similar mandates – a robust incentive program in Illinois, emerging markets like Texas and Florida becoming the new engines of retrofit growth, and the proliferation of solar-plus-storage.", "Meanwhile, the non-residential PV market is on track for another down year as the segment acclimates to a reduced incentive environment across major state markets in 2019.", "However, this will be incrementally offset starting in 2020 as the next wave of states with robust community solar mandates – New York, Maryland, Illinois and New Jersey – begin to see the realization of those pipelines.", "Increasing solar-plus-storage viability will also begin to have an impact on non-residential demand.", "By 2023, roughly 30% of non-residential PV will come from community solar, and ~20% will come from solar-plus-storage projects.", "By 2020, 28 states in the U.S. are expected to have 100+ MWdc annual solar markets, with 25 of those states being home to more than 1 GWdc of operating solar PV.", "This compares to only two states with 100+ MWdc annual solar markets in 2010.", "Forecast details by state (43 states plus Washington, D.C.) and market segment through 2024 are available in the full report.", "U.S. solar market insightÂ® is a quarterly publication of Wood Mackenzie Power & Renewables, Inc. d/b/a Greentech Media and the Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA)Â®.", "Each quarter, we collect granular data on the U.S. solar market from nearly 200 utilities, state agencies, installers and manufacturers.", "This data provides the backbone of this U.S. solar market insightÂ® report, in which we identify and analyze trends in U.S. solar demand, manufacturing and pricing by state and market segment.", "We also use this analysis to look forward and forecast demand over the next five years. All forecasts are from Wood Mackenzie, Limited; SEIA does not predict future pricing, bid terms, costs, deployment or supply.", "Our coverage in these reports includes 43 individual states and Washington, D.C.

energy assistance funding sources and approaches in six states: California, Colorado, Florida, Illinois, Massachusetts and Michigan.", "The brief was written by Alana Landey of ASPE's Office of Human Services Policy with assistance from Yuliya Rzad, Administration for Children and Families, Office of Community Services.", "Office of the Assistant Secretary for Planning and Evaluation", "Approaches to Low-Income Energy Assistance Funding in Selected States", "States rely on a variety of funding sources to help low-income residents pay their utility bills and reduce home energy costs.", "The Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP), administered by the Administration for Children and Families in the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), is the chief source of federal low-income energy assistance.", "However, a variety of other federal, state and local programs and resources also play key roles in helping vulnerable Americans heat, cool and weatherize their homes.", "As a capped block grant program, LIHEAP serves only a small proportion of those eligible for benefits, and funding for the program has fluctuated considerably over the past several years.", "The relatively limited reach of the program compared to overall need is an incentive for states to identify and use nonfederal funding sources.", "While the assistance provided from these other sources is key, little is known about how individual states utilize these various funding streams to provide energy assistance.", "This research brief presents findings from a qualitative study of energy assistance funding sources and strategies in six purposively selected states – California, Colorado, Florida, Illinois, Massachusetts and Michigan.", "It identifies promising practices that other states may want to consider as they confront limited federal energy assistance funding and that may merit further study.", "The information presented here is based on a qualitative study, conducted by HHS staff, of six purposively selected states – California, Colorado, Florida, Illinois, Massachusetts and Michigan.", "While these states represent some variation in region, climate, proportion of population in poverty, and size of LIHEAP grant, they primarily were chosen based on (1) anecdotal evidence from federal and state experts of effective leveraging of disparate funding sources and promising private sector/state partnership arrangements, and (2) willingness to participate in the study.", "While the findings presented here are likely unique to these particular states and cannot be generalized to all states, we identify some common themes across the six states studied.", "The study is intended as a step toward better understanding how states utilize a variety of funding sources and partnership strategies to provide energy assistance to their neediest residents.", "Information was obtained via telephone conversations, e-mail inquiries and Internet research from a variety of sources in each state, including state LIHEAP directors and their staffs, public utility commissions, utility companies and their web sites, and private nonprofits involved in energy assistance efforts.", "We also consulted several national resources such as the LIHEAP Clearinghouse, a repository of state and federal LIHEAP information maintained by HHS, and representatives of national organizations such as the National Association for State Community Services Programs, the National Energy Assistance Directors Association, and the National Energy and Utility Affordability Coalition.", "This brief and accompanying state profiles present funding figures and funding sources as provided by study respondents in telephone conversations and e-mail.", "In some cases, particularly in the case of private funds, these figures are rounded or approximate, and are sometimes derived from information collected informally by those we consulted.", "We used FY 2012 as the base year for funding data since that year was easiest for states to provide, but in some cases we also cite other years for comparison purposes or when more recent numbers were available.", "Overview of Main Energy Assistance Funding Sources", "States can draw from a number of federal, state and local resources to provide energy assistance to their residents.", "While LIHEAP represents the main source of federal energy assistance, the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) provides weatherization assistance funding via formula grants to states and the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) provides utility assistance through rent subsidies.", "State and local resources can include appropriations from state general funds; state-assessed surcharges on customers of regulated utilities (called ratepayer funds); voluntary utility company programs encouraging contributions from customers and employees; and charitable contributions funded by private nonprofit organizations, religious groups and foundations.", "Categories and amounts of funding differ considerably across states, as the table below and the attached state profiles show.", "For four of the six study states, LIHEAP represents the largest source of energy assistance funding, while in California and Massachusetts, state ratepayer funds are the primary funding source.", "There are five potential sources of federal energy assistance funding:", "LIHEAP: LIHEAP was established in 1981 to provide block grant funds and emergency funds to states, territories and tribes to assist low-income households with heating and cooling expenses and home weatherizing.", "The program is funded at $3.4 billion for FY 2014,1 compared to peak program funding of more than $5 billion in FYs 2009 and 2010.", "Funds are distributed to states through a formula that takes into account each state’s proportion of low-income households, the cost and prevalence of fuel types used for residential heating and cooling, and climate.", "Benefits are structured to provide the highest level of assistance to those with the lowest incomes, taking into account household size and energy expenses.", "HHS awards LIHEAP grants to state agencies (typically human services departments), the majority of which then subgrant funds to community action agencies, other nonprofits, or local governments that determine client eligibility and benefit levels.", "The LIHEAP statute requires that each grantee set income eligibility thresholds at or below 150 percent of the HHS poverty guidelines or 60 percent of the state median income, provided that no income threshold is lower than 110 percent of the HHS poverty guidelines.", "Each grantee has the discretion to set the specific income threshold as well as define countable and noncountable income.", "Grantees also have the option of applying assets tests and creating additional eligibility requirements not related to income.", "In addition to the block grant, LIHEAP includes emergency contingency funds that are released by the Secretary of HHS during times of energy price increases or extreme weather (although no contingency funds have been appropriated since 2011), leveraging incentive funds to reward states for raising additional funding from nonfederal sources, and funds for demonstration projects that focus on the intersection of energy, health and safety.", "States have the discretion to use up to 15 percent of their LIHEAP grants (or up to 25 percent with an approved waiver) for weatherization activities.", "The proportion of income spent on residential energy – known as energy burden – is higher for low-income households than for all households, primarily because income is lower but also in part because the homes tend to be older and less energy-efficient.", "Energy burden for LIHEAP recipient households is reduced due to LIHEAP benefits, but even with the assistance, historically LIHEAP household energy burden is about twice that of all households.2 LIHEAP reaches a relatively small fraction of eligible households, due to the limited nature of the block grant relative to the number of low-income individuals", "nationwide.3 The percent of eligible households receiving LIHEAP dropped from 36 percent at the beginning of the program in 1981 to 15 percent in 1997, and the participation rate has remained at about that level since.4", "As shown in Table 1, the six states in this study had FY 2012 LIHEAP grants that varied from a low of $47 million in Colorado to a high of $186 million in Illinois.", "Weatherization Assistance Program (WAP): DOE administers WAP, created in 1976 to provide formula grant funds to states to improve home energy efficiency and reduce energy consumption by low-income households.", "The funding distribution formula is based on the size of each state’s low-income population, climate, and energy expenditures by low-income households.", "As noted above, states can allocate up to 15 percent of their LIHEAP grant to low-income residential weatherization or other energy-related home repair, and over time states’ contributions of LIHEAP funding for weatherization have come to exceed the DOE budget for WAP.5 WAP funding was approximately $250 million from FY 2002 to FY 2007, then surged in FY 2009 with a $5 billion infusion under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act.", "Subsequent appropriations have been lower, and WAP provided a total of $138 million to states in FY 2013.6 Normally, WAP funding is distributed to all states based on the allocation formula, but in 2012 some states – including two states in this study, Colorado and Florida – received no WAP funding.", "This was a one-time change to redistribute funds from states that had not yet expended all their Recovery Act weatherization funds to states that had spent all their funds.", "Housing supports: HUD funding assists in paying energy costs for low-income public housing and assisted-housing residents.", "HUD’s efforts are aimed at both subsidizing utility costs for residents of public housing and retrofitting publicly subsidized low-income housing to be more energy-efficient.", "In Section 8 and other assisted housing units, HUD rental assistance is used to pay utilities that are included as part of the rent.", "For units where heating and air conditioning are not included in the rent, families in Housing Choice Voucher programs may receive a utility allowance to pay for reasonable utility costs.", "States vary considerably in how they take into account these HUD-funded utility subsidies in determining LIHEAP eligibility for subsidized housing tenants who have out-of-pocket utility costs.", "Some states reduce the LIHEAP benefit by a flat amount and others use actual out-of-pocket costs to determine benefit amounts.", "About half the states deny LIHEAP eligibility to subsidized housing residents whose energy costs are included in their rent.7 HUD does not report energy assistance funding at the state level, and this study did not capture any HUD funding in the study states.", "Temporary Assistance to Needy Families (TANF): States can use their HHS-administered TANF block grant funds to help recipient households pay utility costs, although little data exist to document the extent of this practice.", "Some states do this under the “assistance” category of spending since it can include benefits directed at basic needs, which includes utility payments, and some states categorize it as “non-assistance” if it is a nonrecurring, short-term benefit.", "According to a national study of TANF spending done in 2009, five states used TANF funding for emergency energy assistance.8 Among the six states included in the present study, Michigan reported using about $30 million of its TANF funding to provide energy assistance to TANF clients also on LIHEAP.", "Community Services Block Grant (CSBG): CSBG, another HHS program, funds a wide variety of antipoverty programs administered at the community level through local agencies that often also administer LIHEAP funds passed down from the state.", "CSBG funding can be used for emergency assistance, which includes emergency fuel and utility payments.", "In FY 2009, 3.7 million families received help with fuel or utility payments through CSBG.9 It is possible that some of these households received LIHEAP benefits as well.", "While none of the states in this study reported using CSBG funding for energy assistance, it is possible local agencies utilize this funding source.", "States can draw from several main sources of public funding at the state level:", "Ratepayer funds: Many states mandate that their public, regulated energy utilities impose a surcharge on their customers to fund ratepayer programs that allow the utility companies to provide discounts on low-income customers’ utility bills.", "The LIHEAP Clearinghouse reports that there are over 300 state-mandated and voluntary fuel funds in at least 47 states.10 In some states, the funds collected through ratepayer programs go to the state to augment LIHEAP funding; in other states, utility companies administer the utility bill subsidies for their customers directly.", "We categorize state-mandated ratepayer funds as state public funding since most states have laws requiring the collection of those funds and their use for low-income energy assistance, even though not all of these funds pass through state hands or are administered as part of states’ LIHEAP programs.", "In this study, state-mandated ratepayer programs were significant sources of energy assistance for California, Colorado, Illinois and Massachusetts.", "This was the case in Michigan as well, until a 2012 court ruling determined that the state can no longer mandate regulated utilities to collect ratepayer surcharges, which halted ratepayer funding.", "Before the court ruling, Michigan split $70 million in ratepayer fund revenue between the state LIHEAP program and state community action agencies to serve those who did not qualify for LIHEAP but needed utility bill assistance, and utilities used some of the funds to provide weatherization and rate discounts to low-income customers.", "Michigan utility vendors are now running a voluntary ratepayer program that generated $50 million in 2013.", "Illinois has both a state-mandated ratepayer fund and a voluntary, vendor-administered ratepayer fund.", "Percent-of-income payment programs (PIPPs): Revenues from ratepayer programs can also fund PIPPs, in which low-income customers agree to pay a set percentage of their incomes toward their utility bills in exchange for discounts on bills.", "In some cases, PIPP participation can include forgiveness of arrearages, or accrued amounts owed on utilities.", "Two of the study states – Colorado and Illinois – are among the eight states nationally that are known to have PIPPs.11", "General funds: Some states, including Massachusetts and Michigan in this study, also provide general funds appropriated by the state legislature for energy assistance purposes.", "This is a fairly widespread practice nationally: in 2010, 22 states reported using a total of $591 million in state and local funds to supplement LIHEAP.12", "However, few states are able to use their own funds for this purpose on a regular basis, and the amounts tend to fluctuate in response to energy prices and LIHEAP funding levels.13", "States can draw on a variety of private funding sources to augment public funding of energy assistance.", "These most typically take the form of voluntary vendor donation programs and programs run by private nonprofit and religious organizations.", "All of the six states in this study, with the exception of California, have some form of privately funded energy assistance available to their residents.", "In some cases those funds are administered by local LIHEAP agencies, and in other cases the private organization provides the assistance directly to customers or to local nonprofit service agencies that administer the funds.", "| state funding (including mandated ratepayer

Four main utility companies participate in two state-mandated elements: the California Alternative Rates for Energy (CARE) program, which provides discounts on utility bills, and the Energy Savings Assistance Program (ESAP), which provides no-cost weatherization services.", "Combined, these two programs provide $1.5 billion in assistance to low-income utility customers. The four utilities work closely with local LIHEAP agencies to ensure eligible customers are enrolled in CARE.", "California is also particularly distinctive for developing a consortium of nonprofits. Many of California’s local LIHEAP agencies have joined to form the Association of California Community and Energy Services (ACCES), which serves as a network for advocating for the energy needs of low-income residents.", "The group provides input to the state public utility commission on utility rate-setting and works with the state LIHEAP office on low-income program issues and policies.", "The state LIHEAP office transfers 25 percent of its LIHEAP grant to weatherization activities (notably more than the typical 10 percent for most states), and works closely with utility companies and nonprofits to pilot solar energy technologies for improving the energy efficiency of low- and moderate-income households and to better coordinate state and federal weatherization initiatives.", "A distinctive element of Colorado’s low-income energy assistance environment is the central role played by a statewide nonprofit organization in collecting and administering assistance.", "This nonprofit, Energy Outreach Colorado (EOC), was created in 1989 to raise private funds to fill the gap left by declining federal LIHEAP funding.", "EOC continues to help fill this gap by providing help to 17,000 households through a statewide network of 120 community-level service providers.", "EOC partners with the state to run the toll-free call system which provides Coloradans with a single point of contact for energy assistance information.", "It is also the contractor for the state’s crisis assistance program that repairs and replaces residential heating systems.", "The state also benefits from a highly collaborative approach to energy assistance that connects state program staff, utility companies, the public utility commission and the nonprofit sector to address issues and develop policy.", "One mechanism that supports this approach is the Commission on Low Income Energy Assistance, through which the LIHEAP program works with the state energy office and EOC to coordinate state-funded energy assistance services.", "Colorado also has a centralized energy assistance eligibility processing system that allows the state to use data on households’ heating costs, uploaded daily by utility companies, to determine LIHEAP eligibility.", "Florida, the one entirely southern, warm-weather state in the study, has no ratepayer program or PIPP, but benefits from a strong local provider network and referral system.", "LIHEAP funds are administered at the local rather than state level, by a mix of local governments and private, nonprofit agencies.", "About half of Florida’s 29 local agencies are able to augment the limited state LIHEAP grant with private funding from various sources such as voluntary utility company donation programs, the Salvation Army, and United Way.14", "For instance, one of Florida’s largest utilities, Florida Power and Light, raised $1.4 million in 2012 through its Care to Share donation program.15 The state’s local agency network helps redirect clients to other providers if their closest program is out of funding.", "Florida’s Coalition of Energy Vendors, a partnership between utility companies and local agencies, helps the state develop and track subgrantee performance measures and collect utility data on household energy usage patterns.", "Local agency caseworkers can pay utility bills on clients’ behalf through online systems created by utility companies.", "Illinois benefits from a particularly wide array of state and private funding sources, including both a a private, voluntary ratepayer program as well as a state-mandated one;

Several of the study states depend on especially active networks of local service delivery organizations to coordinate multiple funding sources of energy assistance and to ensure clients are referred to the right resources.", "This is especially important in Florida, the study state with decentralized administration of its LIHEAP program, and in California.", "In these states, local service providers communicate regularly about their funding status so clients applying at a program where funding is exhausted can be directed to other nearby resources.", "This approach can help states ensure maximum reach and effectiveness of existing funding.", "Varied private fundraising initiatives. In this study, Massachusetts and Michigan are notable for their number of different statewide private fundraising efforts tailored to specific purposes such as weatherization, bulk fuel discounts and consumer education.", "Florida draws on a variety of private funding sources at the local level, and Colorado taps many private sources through a single statewide nonprofit.", "While the models and amounts of funding differ, these states appear to benefit from connections to a broad array of private charitable organizations.", "Cultivating relationships with charities and foundations at both the state and local levels can position states to explore more private fundraising opportunities.", "Private ratepayer funds. Two of the study states, Illinois and Michigan, have been able to supplement public and other private funding with voluntary ratepayer programs implemented and managed by large utility companies.", "In Michigan’s case, the private ratepayer fund generated $50 million for the state in 2013 - a significant help to the state after the 2012 court case invalidating mandated ratepayer surcharges, which generated $70 million in revenue.", "While the implications of the Michigan state court case for other states is unclear, the willingness of Michigan utilities to try to help fill this sudden funding gap, and their ability to replace over 70 percent of the lost funding so quickly, highlight the considerable role that utilities can play in helping states augment limited public energy assistance funds.", "Illinois, which has both state-mandated and private, voluntary ratepayer programs, could serve as a model for other states considering new ways to more effectively leverage the potential of this funding source.", "Home heating tax credits. Michigan is unique in providing home energy assistance through a home heating tax credit that can be claimed on state income tax forms.", "LIHEAP funds pay for the Home Heating Credit, but the state’s Department of Treasury issues the credits directly to utility companies on behalf of individuals.", "The credit is available to all state residents regardless of whether they file a tax return, but many eligible low-income Michigan residents who do not file tax returns are unaware of the availability of this benefit and do not claim it.18 Other states interested in pursuing a tax-based approach to energy assistance could use Michigan’s experience as a guide, and could perhaps tailor the strategy for specific state needs and tax systems.", "As indicated, this study represents one step toward better understanding how states utilize a variety of public and private funding sources to augment their federal LIHEAP block grant funds to provide energy assistance to low-income residents.", "Exploring the topics listed below would help us build on this work by encouraging information-sharing among states and focusing on some specific aspects of nonfederal funding options that emerged from this study as particularly promising.", "Discussion with states about their current funding strategies could provide further ideas for study.", "Funding strategies discussions among states.

This study demonstrates the critical roles utility companies play in publicizing utility rate discount programs for low-income customers, connecting eligible customers to assistance, and in some cases operating voluntary donation programs, sometimes in partnership with other private organizations.", "In-depth profiles of particularly active utilities in different state environments could shed light on how these utilities manage relationships with state governments and nonprofits, how utilities benefit from such partnerships, and how states can improve existing relationships with utilities.", "Role of public utility commissions. Some states have very active public utility commissions or public service commissions, which set rates for regulated utilities and in some cases are involved in overseeing utility companies’ administration of ratepayer funds and private fundraising efforts.", "A follow-on study could examine the roles of particular commissions and identify ways for states to leverage the commissions’ expertise with utility companies to support fundraising partnerships.", "CSGB and TANF funding for energy assistance.

Participants in these meetings acknowledged that Level 2 charging is favorable to fast charging because it generally requires less electricity at a particular moment in time and can be reasonably managed through time-varying rate designs.", "However, several stakeholders also noted that widespread public fast charging stations are a key consideration for consumers who are looking at buying an EV.", "In other words, while Level 2 charging has the greatest promise of providing benefits to the electric grid, those benefits depend on EV ownership and that partly depends on the perception of available public fast charging stations.", "In this case, by deploying multiple pilots as a package, Xcel Energy was able to address stakeholder interests in both types of charging infrastructure.", "Several participants in our stakeholder meetings made clear that they wanted Xcel Energy’s EV programs to be designed to incentivize charging behavior that doesn’t increase costs at peak times of electricity usage, instead incentivizing usage when renewables are producing power.", "In response to this, Xcel Energy offered a conventional two-part time-varying rate for all three of its EV pilots, with on-peak occurring from 9 a.m. to 9 p.m., and off-peak occurring from 9 p.m. to 9 a.m.", "This proposed rate design led to a two-part discussion that may be insightful to other utilities.", "First, some stakeholders wanted to see a more advanced rate design used for these pilots – one that would deploy more time periods (e.g., four time periods per day rather than two) to send more accurate price signals to customers.", "Notably, and as I’ve written about previously, Xcel Energy received approval for a more advanced residential time-varying rate design pilot in May of 2018, which has four electricity price changes in each day.", "Therefore, some stakeholders wanted to see this rate design deployed for the EV pilots. Second, for the public charging pilot, there was a concern that while the charging station owners (which, in Xcel Energy’s proposed design, will be third parties) would pay time-varying rates, the owners might not necessarily pass those rates on to the EV drivers using the charging stations, eliminating any charging behavior change that would have resulted.", "In response, the PUC allowed the conventional time-varying rate design to move forward in the interim but required Xcel Energy to come back with a more refined rate design for the fleet and public charging EV pilots within six months.", "For the public charging site hosts in particular, the PUC asked charging station operators to use time-varying rates by default, but allowed them to opt-out of doing so if warranted.", "In this particular case, the two-period time-varying rate proved unacceptable to both stakeholders and the commission.", "However, the fact that Xcel Energy had already completed some legwork to design a more advanced time-varying rate made it particularly hard to defend the two-part rate.", "Utilities developing EV programs should certainly be looking at time-varying rate designs, and, based on this experience, would do well to make the price signals in those rate designs as accurate as possible.", "Consumer impacts, including cost recovery for pilot expenses, were of significant concern in our stakeholder meetings, with some participants stressing the importance of ensuring the benefits of EV programs outweigh the costs for all customers, EV drivers and non-EV drivers alike.", "This also became a key point of discussion when the pilots were being considered by the PUC.", "The discussion centered on who should pay for the pilots, since EV infrastructure and services are in the interests of both the utility and ratepayers.", "Consumer advocates argued that, without an analysis showing the measurable benefits to all ratepayers, only the utility and participating customers should pay for the programs, as this is otherwise just a marketing initiative to sell more electricity to some customers at the expense of all.", "The Commission disagreed, stating that it asked the utilities to come forward with innovative EV pilot projects for several reasons in the public interest and this is an example of a utility following through on that request.", "Denying this request would send the wrong signal—that innovation is not rewarded. Therefore, they decided that all ratepayers should fund the pilots, as long as those expenses are shown by the utility to be reasonable and prudent.", "The Commission clarified that the decision applies only to the pilots and that one intended outcome is to gather information that can enable better cost-benefit analysis in the future.", "As part of this, they made the following decisions:", "- While the utility typically does not own and recover costs on infrastructure beyond a customer’s service connection, for the purposes of these pilots the Commission allowed Xcel Energy to classify wiring and charging equipment beyond the meter as part of their distribution system.", "- While customers benefitting from a new service line typically need to contribute to the costs of that line, for these specific pilots the Commission allowed those costs to be spread out across all ratepayers.", "- Finally, Xcel Energy is currently operating under a multi-year rate plan, which is intended to promote innovation by allowing the utility flexibility on costs over multiple years, but within certain pre-established limits.", "While some parties argued that costs for these pilots should count within those limits, Xcel Energy argued that these costs were unforeseen when the limits were established, and that they should be allowed to recover these costs beyond those limits.", "The Commission ultimately agreed, but suggested that Xcel Energy’s next multi-year rate plan should include a proposed research and development budget to avoid this happening again in the future.", "While the decisions made in this case may be unique to Xcel Energy and Minnesota, the broader lesson is that the costs and benefits of utility EV programs need to be thought through carefully, with specific attention to impacts on non-participants.", "In summary, utility EV programs offer a unique opportunity to create benefits for shareholders, consumers, and the environment, but they need to be implemented carefully and thoughtfully.", "Xcel Energy’s pilot programs in Minnesota show that finding a balance among the needs of diverse interests is difficult, but not impossible, and that that upfront stakeholder engagement can be a beneficial step towards ensuring that a utility’s final proposal is as close to acceptable as possible among the parties who will potentially advocate for or against it.", "UPDATE: There was a request submitted to the PUC to reconsider its order approving Xcel’s EV pilots. The request was denied and the denial is now being appealed.", "More information is available in MN PUC Docket 18-643."]}

Time scarcity and cooking skills were identified as common barriers to prepare home meals [6, 11, 12, 16, 17].", "Previous research emphasized that individuals with lower cooking skills were more likely to consume away from home food such as ready meals or take-out meals from fast food or restaurants [11, 18].", "In response to these difficulties, a number of studies have evaluated the opportunity to improve cooking skills in order to promote healthy dietary patterns [19–21].", "To face time pressure, a series of qualitative studies highlighted that parents resort to food choice coping strategies, such as meal simplification, taking out, or meal planning [16, 17, 22–26] despite their potential impact on diet quality.", "Among these strategies, time management skills [27] and in particular meal planning [28, 29], which consists in deciding ahead the foods that will be eaten in the next few days, has been previously suggested as a solution to balance competing time demands and reduce barriers to healthy dietary practices.", "In the literature, very few studies have investigated meal planning practices and they often focused on adequate diet for diabetic subjects", "[30–32].

They estimated the amounts eaten using validated photographs of portion sizes [41], using household measures or by indicating the exact quantity (grams) or volume (milliliters).", "Daily mean food intakes were calculated, weighted for the type of day of the week. Energy, nutrient and food group intakes were estimated using the NutriNet-Santé composition table including more than 2000 foods [42].", "Dietary underreporting was identified on the basis of the method proposed by Black [43]. We hypothesize that meal planning encourages food preparation and therefore considered food groups that can be used in food preparation (e.g. eggs).", "In addition, we considered food groups that have nutritional interest (e.g. fruits). Thus, the following food groups were included in the study: fruits, vegetables, fish (including seafood and processed seafood), meat (including cooked ham, offal), eggs, milk, cheese, added fats (including oil, butter, margarine, vinaigrette), sugary products (e.g. cake, biscuits, sugars, honey, jam, chocolate) and starchy foods (including potato, legumes, pasta, rice, other cereals) with a specific focus on legumes and whole grain starchy foods (including whole grain pasta, rice, other cereals).", "Adherence to nutritional guidelines was assessed using the PNNS Guideline Score (PNNS-GS). The 15-point PNNS-GS is a validated a priori score reflecting the adherence to the official French nutritional guidelines which has been extensively described elsewhere [44].", "Details on computation of this score are in Additional file 1. Briefly, it includes 13 components: eight refer to food-serving recommendations (fruit and vegetables; starchy foods; whole grain products; dairy products; meat, eggs and fish; fish and seafood; vegetable fat; water vs. soda), four refer to moderation in consumption (added fat; salt; sweets; alcohol) and one component pertains to physical activity [44, 45].", "Points are deducted for overconsumption of salt (>12 g/day), added sugars (>17.5% of energy intake), or when energy intake exceeds the needed energy level by more than 5%.", "Each component cut-off was that of the threshold defined by the PNNS public health objectives when available [45] otherwise they were established according to the French Recommended Dietary Allowances [46].", "For the present analysis, we consider the mPNNS-GS, a modified version of the PNNS-GS, which takes into account only the dietary components, therefore excluding the physical activity component.", "Food variety has been defined as the number of different food items reported to be eaten over a given reference period [47].", "Considering that seasonality is likely to influence food variety and that a period of 10 to 15 days has been recommended to accurately assess food variety [48], the food variety was evaluated using a Food Frequency Questionnaire (FFQ).", "Sixteen months after baseline, participants were invited to complete a self-administrated 240-items FFQ to assess their usual dietary intake over the past year [49].", "Participants were asked to report their consumption frequency on the basis of how many times they ate the standard portion size proposed (typical household measurements such as spoon or standard unit such as a yogurt).", "The frequency of consumption referred to usual consumption over the past year on an increasing scale including yearly, monthly, weekly or daily units, as suitable, and participants were asked to provide only one answer.", "The food variety score corresponded to the number of FFQ items reported to be consumed at least once during the last year [47].", "The maximum score was therefore 240. Fruit and vegetable variety scores were also computed based on the number of different fruits and vegetables reported by the participants.", "Height and weight were assessed by using an anthropometric questionnaire, which was self-administered online, at baseline and each year thereafter [50, 51].", "For each participant, the closest available data to the meal planning questionnaire were used for the analysis.", "Data were not collected for pregnant women. BMI (in kg/m2) was calculated as the ratio of weight to squared height.", "Participants were classified as underweight or normal weight (BMI < 25), overweight (25 ≤ BMI < 30) and obesity (BMI ≥ 30) according to WHO references values [52].", "The analysis focused on participants who had completed the meal planning questionnaire, had declared being involved in meal preparation in their household, and who had completed at least three 24-h dietary records since they were included in the study, as well as the FFQ.", "Chi-square tests and Student’s t tests were used to compare characteristics of included vs. excluded participants, as well as meal planners vs. non-meal planners.", "Meal planners’ practices were also described. Continuous variables are presented as means ± SDs and categorical variables as percentages.", "ANCOVAs were performed to investigate the relationship between meal planning and energy, macronutrients and food groups.", "However, for some particular food groups which did not exhibit normal distribution (i.e. eggs, milk, legumes, and whole grain starchy foods), mainly due to a high proportion of non-consumers, a binary variable (consumer/non-consumer) was created and a logistic regression analysis was performed.", "Logistic regression models were also used to assess the associations between meal planning and quartiles of mPNNS-GS, as well as quartiles of food variety scores (overall, fruit and vegetable) and BMI categories.", "Due to significant interactions and differences on the associations with meal planning, analyses on BMI were performed separately by sex.", "Meal planning has been described as a cooking skill [53]. Thus, characteristics that have been shown to influence cooking practices, dietary intakes or weight status were considered as confounders in the present analyses.", "Models were therefore all adjusted for sex [1, 54, 55], age [56], educational level, monthly income [6], presence of children in the household [6], history of dieting to lose weight during the past year [57], physical activity [58], and cooking frequency.", "Models evaluating the associations with mPNNS-GS, macronutrient and food groups intakes were further adjusted for daily energy intake and number of 24-h dietary records completed by participants.", "The energy model was only adjusted on the number of 24-h records while the food variety models were adjusted on daily energy intake.", "Missing covariate data were imputed using multiple imputation method.", "Sensitivity analyses were conducted on a subsample of individuals having responded to at least one of the dietary assessments (i.e. FFQ, dietary records).", "In addition, analyses were conducted using another definition of food variety score (number of FFQ items reported to be consumed more than once a week)", "All tests of statistical significance were two-sided and the type I error was set at 5%.

differences regarding sociodemographic, economic and lifestyle characteristics due to the large sample size, meal planners and non-meal planners exhibited very similar profiles.", "In particular, no significant difference in meal planning was observed in relation with the presence of children in the household.", "This result appears in contrast with previous qualitative studies suggesting that the presence of children increases the feeling of time scarcity [17, 23–26, 60] and therefore the need of developing time-saving strategies, such as meal planning.", "However, fatigue and time scarcity can also decrease the likelihood for following meal plans [26].", "To our knowledge, this study is the first to describe meal planning practices in a general population sample.", "Overall, more than one out two participants revealed to plan their meals at least occasionally. Generally, individuals planned their meals several times a week, for a few days period including weekdays and weekend, and get inspiration mostly from their personal recipe repertoire or ingredients available during grocery shopping.", "A previous survey evaluating Canadians’ attitudes and habits with regard to home food preparation highlighted that about 40% of the participants decide what they will prepare for dinner during the day, 27% the day before and 33% at least two days before [29].", "However, the latter did not explore the modalities of meal planning.", "Based on a large sample of general population, our data support the notion that planning meal is indeed associated with a better adherence to nutritional guidelines and an increased food variety (overall, fruits and vegetables).", "However, it should be noted that only small differences were observed with energy, macronutrient and food group intakes specifically.", "Although meal planning has been previously suggested as a potential tool to improve dietary quality [28, 29], to our knowledge, no study in the literature has investigated this related association.", "Previous authors highlighted that individuals deciding in advance what to prepare for dinner were more likely to cook homemade dishes [29].", "Since more frequent food preparation has been linked with a better diet quality [12–14], this could potentially explain the healthier diet observed in meal planners.", "A few hypotheses can be made on how meal planning could encourage home food preparation. First, meal planning might address the issue of not knowing what to prepare for dinner, that has been previously described as a barrier for home meal preparation [29].", "Second, by planning meals individuals may think about recipes that can be prepared in a limited period of time and, therefore reduce the feeling of time scarcity, that may limit home meal preparation", "[6, 12, 16] and increase the recourse to food choice coping strategies such as eating out, delivery meals or ready prepared food", "[17, 23–25]. In addition, planning meals may reduce the risk of missing ingredients for home meal preparation which could also lead to the consumption of food prepared away from home.", "Finally, deciding what foods will be eaten in the next few days could also enable individuals to cook more diversified recipes and to anticipate grocery shopping for the specific ingredients needed, thus potentially explaining the increased food variety observed in meal planners.", "However, reverse causality cannot be excluded since individuals interested in having a healthy diet might be more likely to plan their meals.", "In line with this idea, meal-planners in our sample were more likely to have higher educational level, to have higher income, to be physically active and to have a lower BMI, characteristics that have been related with a better attitude towards healthy eating [61].", "Our results showed that women who planned meals were less likely to be overweight or obese, while in men, there was an association with obesity only.", "Since meal planners have a diet of higher quality, it potentially prevents overweight in these individuals [52].", "However, we cannot exclude reverse causality. People attaching more importance to food and weight management might be more likely to plan their meals.", "In line with this hypothesis, two studies in the literature highlighted that meal planning is more frequently used by successful weight loss maintainers compared to those who did not maintain weight losses [36, 37].", "In terms of public health, our results bring supportive insights that promoting meal planning might encourage the preparation of healthier and more varied home meals.", "Previous studies showed that parents would be interested in learning how to plan meals [28, 60], however, other findings suggested that meal planning is also perceived as complex and time consuming [62].", "Specific tools might assist people in managing meal planning but to be adopted and sustainable over time, it is important to identify consumers’ needs.", "The present data highlighted that there are various ways of planning meals. As an example, we observed that the ingredients available during grocery shopping are likely to influence meal planning while existing tools rather propose menus to plan grocery shopping.", "A major strength of this study was its large sample size allowing an evaluation of meal planning practices at a population level.", "The wide range of socio-economic and lifestyle variables collected through the web-based platform enables the control of potential effects of confounding factors.", "In addition, the web-based tool used to assess 24-h dietary records has shown a good validity in prior studies [63, 64].", "However, because of the influence of seasonality on food variety, the FFQ was used to evaluate dietary variety since it allows usual intake estimates over a relatively long period of time [65].", "This study was also subject to several limitations. First, the cross-sectional design of this study prevented any inference of causality.", "Moreover, since participants were volunteers in a nutrition focused cohort, they may have higher health consciousness and interest in nutritional issues.", "The fact that we selected only participants who completed both dietary assessment tools might have exacerbated this characteristic in our sample.", "Therefore, caution is needed when generalizing our results. However, sensitivity analyses including individuals with at least one of the dietary assessments (24-h dietary records or FFQ) revealed similar trends.", "Besides, the fact that participants had relatively high knowledge in nutrition could potentially account for the few differences observed in energy and food group intakes, since they may be able to cook healthful meals without planning meals.", "It is also important to consider that food variety score was based on FFQ data, which has been recorded at different time frames (16 months after the inclusion in the cohort).", "Thus, for participants included since a long time in the cohort study, the estimation may not represent their current dietary repertoire.", "In addition, data were self-reported, thus potentially leading to misreporting due, for example, to desirability bias.", "Nonetheless, previous validation studies performed on a subsample of the NutriNet-Santé study have supported the good validity of self-reported anthropometric and dietary data [63, 64, 66].", "Finally, given that meal planning may be influenced by numerous parameters such as cooking practices and food availability in the surrounding, it is possible that some factors mediating the associations observed in the present paper were not taken into account in the analyses.", "The potential impact of cooking practices was however considered by adding cooking frequency as a confounder.", "Future research should be conducted to address the issue of how food availability could potentially influence the relationship observed between meal planning and diet quality.", "Our results highlighted that individuals planning their meals were more likely to have a better dietary quality, including a higher adherence with nutritional guidelines as well as an increased food variety.", "Additionally, meal planning was associated with lower odds of being obese in men and women and overweight in women only.", "Although interventional or prospective research should be conducted in order to infer causality, these data suggest the potential interest of promoting meal planning to improve dietary quality and prevent overweight.", "Such a tool could partly address the issue of time scarcity reported by consumers for meal preparation and, might therefore encourage home cooking.", "Given the potential benefits of meal planning identified in this study, it would be interesting that future research evaluate the appropriation and the impact of applications designed to help individuals planning their meals.", "We thank all scientists, dieticians, technicians, and assistants who help carry out the NutriNet-Santé study.", "We especially thank Younes Esseddik, Yasmina Chelghoum, Mohand Ait Oufella, Paul Flanzy and Thi Hong Van Duong, computer scientists; Veronique Gourlet, Charlie Menard, Fabien Szabo, Nathalie Arnault, Laurent Bourhis and Stephen Besseau, statisticians; and the dieticians.", "We are grateful to volunteers from the NutriNet-Santé study.", "The NutriNet-Santé Study is supported by the French Ministry of Health (DGS), the French Institute for Public Health Surveillance (InVS), the French National Institute for Health and Medical Research (INSERM), the French National Institute for Agricultural Research (INRA), the Medical Research Foundation (FRM), the National Conservatory for Arts and Crafts (CNAM), the National Institute for Prevention and Health Education (INPES) and the University of Paris 13.", "This study is supported by the National Institute for Prevention and Health Education (INPES).", "In France, there is a very strict regulation concerning the protection of personal data and privacy making difficult the availability of data (even non-nominal data).", "PD: conducted the literature review, drafted the manuscript and performed analyses; CM, VA, GI, BA, EKG, SH and SP: were involved in the interpretation of results and critically reviewed the manuscript; and SH and SP: were responsible for the development of the design and the protocol of the study.", "All authors read and approved the final manuscript.", "The authors declare that they have no competing interests.", "This study is conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki, and all procedures were approved by the Institutional Review Board of the French Institute for Health and Medical Research (IRB Inserm n°0000388FWA00005831) and the Commission Nationale de l’Informatique et des Libertés (CNIL n°908450 and n°909216).", "All participants provided informed consent with an electronic signature.

His father, physician Stephen Arnold Douglass, died when the baby was only two months old.", "His mother, Sarah Fiske Douglass, remarried to Gehazi Granger. In 1830, the Granger family moved from Vermont to upstate New York, where after a brief period at an academy Stephen Douglass began to read law under a locally prominent Democratic attorney.", "In 1833, Stephen made his way west to seek his career and fortune. After arriving in Quincy, Illinois, and operating a private school for a time, he secured a law license and set up practice in Jacksonville, Illinois.", "As he established the basis for a professional career, Stephen also changed the spelling of his last name from Douglass to Douglas.", "Stephen A. Douglas first became politically known in Illinois as a staunch Democratic proponent of President Andrew Jackson.", "Between 1835 and 1840, Douglas held a succession of Illinois state offices, some of them concurrently, including state’s attorney, state legislator, register of the Springfield land office, and secretary of state.", "In 1841, at the age of twenty-seven, he was elected to a seat on the Illinois Supreme Court. In 1836, he lost a disputed race for the U.S. House of Representatives by thirty-six popular votes.", "Four years later he lost a campaign for a U.S. Senate seat by five legislative votes. Only in 1843, running in a newly created congressional district, was Douglas able to win a seat in the House.", "As a member of the House of Representatives, Douglas was among those urging an extension of United States territory from the Atlantic to the Pacific.", "He called for the annexation of Texas, the establishment of military posts along the Western emigrant trails, and organization of a Nebraska territorial government.", "By 1845, these and other strong expansionist positions had won Douglas the chairmanship of the House Committee on Territories.", "Through a congressional colleague, Douglas met Martha Denny Martin (1825-1853), the daughter of a wealthy North Carolina planter and a member of a family long prominent in North Carolina political affairs.", "When Stephen and Martha were married in 1847, Robert Martin offered his new son-in-law his 2,500-acre plantation on the Pearl River in Lawrence County, Mississippi.", "Douglas declined the gift, but after Martin died a year later, the Pearl River plantation was bequeathed to Martha and any children she might have.", "Douglas was designated as the property manager and was allocated 20 per cent of the plantation’s annual income for his services.", "Two children born to their marriage survived into adulthood, Robert Martin Douglas (1849-1917) and Stephen Arnold Douglas, Jr. (1850-1908).", "In 1847, after only three years in the House of Representatives, Douglas was elected by the Illinois state legislature to a seat in the U.S. Senate, where he was made chairman of the Senate Committee on Territories.", "His position gave him an influential role in shaping all aspects of national policy affecting western lands, from the courts and post office to military posts and legislative powers.", "He also became quickly immersed in growing sectional disputes over the future of slavery. As a Senator from a state with a mix of strong anti-slavery and pro-slavery sentiment, and as the manager of a Mississippi plantation with more than 100 slaves, Douglas attempted to craft a political position that would avoid favoring either the North or South.", "The first significant test of this policy, the Compromise of 1850, is usually credited to Henry Clay, but it owed a great deal to Douglas' political skills.", "To satisfy the North, California was admitted as a free state, and the slave trade was abolished in the District of Columbia; to reassure the South, the territories of New Mexico and Utah were organized without a prohibition of slavery, and a rigid fugitive slave law was enacted.", "Despite this careful attempt to placate both sides in the slavery controversy, the reaction to the Compromise in the North was immediate and hostile.", "Douglas came under fierce attack in his home state and was able to calm his supporters only by rushing back to Illinois to defend himself before the Chicago city council and the state legislature.", "In 1853, Douglas sustained a grave personal loss when his wife Martha died following complications from the birth of a daughter.", "After their infant girl also died a few weeks later, a grieving Douglas decided to leave the country for an extended tour of Europe.", "His travels took him to London, Constantinople, Moscow, St. Petersburg, and Paris, in the course of which he secured a number of diplomatic audiences and met Czar Nicholas I and Emperor Napoleon III.", "Douglas' personal life did not recover its equilibrium until 1856, when he married twenty-one-year-old Rose Adele Cutts (1835-1899), known as Adele, whose father, James Madison Cutts, was a nephew of President James Madison and Dolley Madison.", "The new Mrs. Douglas accepted Douglas' two sons as her own and raised them with his approval in her own Catholic faith.", "Their infant daughter Ellen died shortly after birth in 1859. The Douglases built an imposing townhouse in Washington just north of Capitol Hill, and it soon became renowned for lavish parties and receptions.", "Douglas' personal affairs also changed in other respects. In 1857, Douglas sold the family plantation on the Pearl River, which had been affected by flooding and poor crops, and in partnership with James A. McHatton of Baton Rouge, moved the agricultural operation to a 2,000-acre property south of Greenville, Mississippi.", "Throughout his career, Douglas maintained a strong interest in science, education, and technological improvements.", "In 1850, Douglas secured the passage of federal legislation supporting the Illinois Central Railroad route from Chicago down the Mississippi Valley to New Orleans, thus helping to make Chicago and Illinois a national center for industry and commerce.", "Douglas was an enthusiastic supporter of the Smithsonian Institution from the time of its founding and in 1854 was appointed a regent of the Smithsonian.", "In 1858 Douglas gave ten acres on the south side of Chicago to serve as the site of the newly organized University of Chicago; the land was part of his Oakenwald estate, where Douglas planned to develop an exclusive suburban neighborhood and erect his own residence.", "Douglas' rising prominence in national affairs reached a crest in January 1854, when he introduced the Kansas-Nebraska bill to organize governments in the Kansas and Nebraska territories.", "In each territory, the question of slavery would be reserved until it entered the Union as a new state; at that time, the voting citizens would draw up a constitution and determine whether or not their state would permit slavery.", "The Kansas-Nebraska bill embodied Douglas' doctrine of popular sovereignty, according to which the voters in newly admitted states, not the federal government, would determine the future of slavery by exercising their democratic rights to self-government.", "Douglas also hoped that popular sovereignty would remove slavery from congressional debate and insulate the federal government from further sectional conflict.", "The Kansas-Nebraska Act, however, unleashed a new torrent of angry protest by Northern anti-slavery forces, who felt it opened the door to an expansion of slavery across the West.", "Douglas returned to Illinois to defend his position, touring the state for two months and twice trading opposing speeches with Abraham Lincoln, a former Whig legislator and congressman who reemerged on the political stage and became a spokesman for the new Republican Party.", "In the wake of the Kansas-Nebraska Act, Douglas also found himself at odds with important elements of the national Democratic party.", "He had first attempted to gain the Democratic nomination for president in 1852. In 1856, he tried once again for the presidential nomination, but withdrew his name in favor of James Buchanan, who went on to win the election.", "The brief alliance between Buchanan and Douglas ended within a year, however, when a pro-slavery convention meeting in Lecompton, Kansas, drew up a constitution proposing statehood and protecting property in slavery.", "Buchanan supported the Lecompton constitution, but Douglas was determined to block it, arguing that its passage was fraudulent and did not express the will of the people in accordance with popular sovereignty.", "Although Douglas could not prevent congressional approval of the constitution, it was later rejected by the voters of Kansas.", "The struggle over Kansas and the spread of slavery became the dominant theme in the Senate election campaign of 1858 in Illinois.", "Douglas was renominated by the Democrats, while Abraham Lincoln was selected as the Republican candidate.", "The campaign between Douglas and Lincoln gained unexpected attention when Lincoln pressed Douglas to agree to join in a series of debates.", "Staged in seven Illinois towns from August to October of 1858, the campaign debates between Douglas and Lincoln drew large crowds and generated detailed press coverage.", "Lincoln charged that Douglas was part of a slavery \"dynasty\" seeking to promote the spread of slavery over the entire nation.", "Douglas argued that Lincoln’s \"House Divided\" speech had pushed the country to the brink of division and that popular sovereignty would resolve the slavery issue.", "On election day, the Republicans won a majority of the popular vote across the state; the Illinois legislature, however, remained in the hands of the Democrats, and Douglas was returned to Washington for another Senate term.", "Douglas and Lincoln were to meet again in the tumultuous presidential election of 1860. Divisions within the Democratic Party had become so deep that when Democrats met first in Charleston and later in Baltimore for their nominating convention, the southern delegates walked out.", "Douglas was able to win the presidential nomination from the remaining northern delegates, but the breakaway Democrats turned to John C. Breckinridge of Kentucky as their candidate.", "The Constitutional Union party nominated John Bell of Tennessee, and the Republicans chose Abraham Lincoln to carry their banner, making the 1860 presidential election a four-way race.", "Douglas was so concerned about the sectional division in the Democratic party and the potential rupture of the federal Union that he decided to break with precedent and campaign on his own behalf, the first presidential candidate in American history to do so.", "Frequently accompanied by Adele, Douglas campaigned through all parts of the country, from New England, New York, and Pennsylvania to Virginia, Tennessee, Alabama, and Georgia.", "His desperate efforts to reunite the Democratic party, however, could not overcome the rapidly disintegrating political situation.", "In November 1860, none of the four presidential candidates secured a majority of the popular vote, but Abraham Lincoln carried the electoral college and won the White House.", "In the months following the presidential election, Douglas returned to Washington to join the efforts to prevent the secession of the southern states, engaging in a series of private meetings with Lincoln to map strategy.", "When the Illinois state legislature went into special session, Douglas traveled to Springfield to make an impassioned speech rallying citizens to a defense of the Union.", "Several weeks later, while staying the Tremont House hotel in Chicago, Douglas fell ill, and his condition soon began to deteriorate.", "On June 3, 1861, with his wife, Adele, at his side, he died.", "The funeral of Stephen A. Douglas was attended by more than 5,000 mourners. His body was laid to rest in a temporary tomb overlooking Lake Michigan, on the Oakenwald property that he had selected for his Chicago residence.", "In 1881, a permanent monument was erected on the site; its designer was Leonard W. Volk, whose wife was a cousin of Douglas and whose education as an artist had been sponsored by Douglas.", "The Civil War had immediate and devastating effects on Douglas family estate. In 1862, Camp Douglas, a Union military prison, was established at the northern end of the Oakenwald property; it housed more than 26,000 captured Confederate soldiers, of which 6,000 died.", "The Douglas mansion in Washington was turned over to the Federal government, and it was converted into a military hospital for the duration of the conflict.", "In Mississippi, the Greenville plantation was raided by Union troops, and the entire cotton crop was lost.", "Douglas' two sons later attempted to recover compensation from the federal government, but without success.", "After the war, Robert Martin Douglas graduated from Georgetown College, served as private secretary to President Ulysses S. Grant, and became a justice of the North Carolina Supreme Court.", "Stephen A. Douglas, Jr., who also studied at Georgetown, moved from North Carolina to Chicago and became an attorney.", "Adele Cutts Douglas remarried in 1866 to Brevet Brigadier General Robert Williams, who later became Adjutant General of the U.S. Army; they had six children.", "The Stephen A. Douglas collection is organized into seven series: Series I: Senate and Constituent Correspondence; Series II: Political; Series III: Personal; Series IV: Financial and Legal; Series V: Artifacts and Ephemera; Series VI: Oversized; and Series VII: Books.", "The largest portion of the collection is housed in Series I. This series contains the incoming correspondence of senators and constituents contemporary to Stephen A. Douglas, arranged chronologically from 1800 to 1867.", "Correspondence with unknown dates has been arranged alphabetically by the name signed and is located at the end of this series.", "Douglas' name has been abbreviated as SAD within Series I.", "Series II consists of materials pertaining to Douglas' political career. It is further divided into nine subseries.", "Subseries 1, Correspondence, primarily contains letters exchanged by Douglas with other prominent political figures, most prominently Abraham Lincoln.", "Also included are documents collected by Douglas, including several letters written by Andrew Jackson in the 1820s.", "Subseries 2, Campaigns, contains broadsides, pamphlets, newspaper clippings and appeals to constituents pertinent to Douglas' campaigns for the U.S. Senate and the presidency and date from 1844 to 1861.", "Subseries 3, Commerce and Internal Improvements, contains materials addressing the national economy and infrastructure, ranging from 1833 to 1861.", "Subseries 4 and 5 document Douglas' involvement in foreign and military affairs.

Boulder first demonstrated its interest in forming a city-owned utility, which would entail buying out Xcel’s distribution assets, in 2005, when it commissioned consultants R.W.

If history is a guide, the battle of Boulder, involving scores of millions of dollars on both sides, is likely to rage on for many years and end in some sort of compromise settlement.", "History also suggests that, regardless of the outcome, the lawyers and consultants representing the city and the utility will do very well indeed.", "Boulder’s Daily Camera reported on December 30 that the city had already spent “just under $7 million exploring and pursuing municipalization . . .", "with the majority of those funds coming from a voter-approved utility occupation tax.” |", "Here’s the economic issue as far as Xcel is concerned. Utility-owned solar has significant advantages of scale, as well as providing assets for the utility’s rate base.", "Customer-owned solar, by Xcel’s reckoning, imposes costs on the utility—and its non-solar customers—for grid support and ancillary services to keep the grid stabilized.", "The company has been in a protracted dispute with solar advocates and regulators over Minnesota’s permissive approach to community solar and rooftop generation.", "According to Fowke, “While solar gardens and rooftop solar have a place in our portfolio as an option for consumers, because they require heavy, heavy subsidization on non-participants, you’ll see us advocate that the primary focus be utility-scale solar so that we can keep energy costs affordable for consumers.”", "That puts Xcel squarely on the investor-owned utility side of a raging dispute in the industry over the way to value distributed solar photovoltaic power (see the October 23, 2015, post, “The Solar PV Economics Conundrum”).", "While Xcel moves toward its renewable energy goals, it faces continued controversy over the company’s coal legacy, as coal remains important to Xcel’s operations in Minnesota and elsewhere.", "Overall, Xcel has 25 coal-fired units at 12 locations (seven in Colorado), with a total of 7,409 MW in capacity.", "Gas capacity is 6,877 MW from 70 units at 25 stations.

And this week, the company announced it will be fast-tracking the retirement of its two remaining coal-burning power plants, which are in Minnesota, by 2030.", "So make no mistake: This is industry-shaking news. Here’s our explainer, first published December 5.", "Greater ambition is in Xcel’s political and economic interests", "Xcel has been a leader on clean energy for a while. According to the company, it has reduced its carbon emissions by 35 percent since 2005.", "Earlier in 2018, it announced plans to, by 2030, reduce carbon emissions 60 percent (from 2005 levels), increase the level of renewable energy in its fleet to 55 percent, and shut down 50 percent of its coal capacity — in the state of Colorado.", "Those goals were enough to win the company Utility Dive’s Utility of the Year Award for 2018.", "But the new goals go much farther. And they cover Xcel’s entire eight-state territory.", "So what pushed the company’s ambition so much higher?", "First, renewables are getting really cheap. In its recent solicitations, Xcel has gotten more bids for renewables, with more variety, for much cheaper.", "Wind and solar plants paired with storage are bidding in cheaper than the ongoing operating costs of existing coal plants.", "Renewables are even giving natural gas a run for its money.", "Second, Xcel’s customers — particularly cities — are demanding it. “When your customers are asking for this over and over,” Fowke said when announcing the news, “you really do listen.", "Boulder, the city of Denver, Breckenridge ... Pueblo, they’re considered or they have already decided that they want to pursue 100 percent renewable.”", "Remember that, because it’s important in an age of no federal climate policy: Cities can move utilities, and utilities can move the energy industry.", "Third, the political landscape is shifting. Democrats took the governor’s mansion in Colorado, Michigan, New Mexico, and Wisconsin.", "In Colorado and New Mexico, they now have a “trifecta” — governor and both legislative houses. Running for governor in Colorado, Jared Polis supported a new renewable energy standard of 100 percent by 2040; with Democratic majorities in the state legislature, he might get it passed.", "Renewables are on the rise in the West, popular with politicians, cities, corporations, and ordinary ratepayers.", "It is to Xcel’s benefit to get ahead of the curve and give the people what they want.", "Fourth, Xcel would very much like to build more stuff.", "It is a vertically integrated monopoly. The areas in which it operates have not been “restructured,” i.e., generation has not been split off from transmission and distribution.", "Regulated monopoly utilities, as I’ve explained in previous stories, do not make money on the power they sell or the fuel they buy.", "They make money by drawing a rate of return on investments in power infrastructure. These “rate-based” investments are the utility’s bread and butter.", "In a broad sense, the shift to renewables is good for such utilities. When they shift from existing fossil fuel plants to new renewable energy, they shift from fuel (coal and natural gas) costs, which they make no money on, to investments in new renewable energy power plants, new batteries to store power and electric car chargers to help electrify the vehicle fleet, and tons of new transmission lines, much of which they can rate-base.", "These goals (perhaps combined with a new, more stringent RPS in Colorado) will help Xcel get permission from regulators to depreciate lots of uneconomic old fossil-fuel assets (which activists have been hassling it about anyway) and build, build, build a bunch of new stuff.", "In short, Xcel stands to profit handsomely, and benefit politically, by giving its customers the clean energy they want.", "(Many ratepayer advocates worry that utilities like Duke are taking advantage of this dynamic, using clean energy as an excuse to build stuff that local, distributed energy could handle better — but that’s a different post.)", "A more interesting question is how this might affect Xcel’s monopoly status. On one hand, riding a political wave as a climate champion allows it to stay ahead of grumbling or desire for restructuring.", "On the other hand, Xcel suddenly needing so much clean energy might help grease the skids for regionalization, i.e., the creation of a restructured Western wholesale power market run by a regional transmission operator (RTO).", "If all of the West is heading toward decarbonization together, the region’s utilities will need to pool their resources.", "In fact, they might need to pool their resources rapidly, because the federal tax credits for wind and solar power are set to expire soon.", "Buying a lot of capacity before then could save a lot of money.", "Fifth — and this may be somewhat peripheral, but it’s interesting — on the very same day Xcel made its announcement, the Boulder City Council voted to move forward with creating a municipal utility and breaking off from Xcel.", "Xcel very much opposes that move. By ramping up its clean energy goals, it may not keep Boulder, but it could dissuade other similar-minded cities from following Boulder out the door.", "Anyway, the decision to go carbon-free by 2050 is not a selfless act on Xcel’s part — it sees which way the wind is blowing and is focused on providing returns for shareholders.", "And the announcement leaves many, many details unspecified, including plans to shut down fossil fuel plants and transition plans for affected communities.", "Nonetheless, it shows that incentives are beginning to align in a hopeful way. It is the smart move, politically and economically, for Xcel to set a course for zero carbon.", "That would have been unthinkable 10 or even five years ago.", "A few other aspects of this story are worth highlighting.", "Xcel explicitly did not promise 100 percent renewable electricity. It promised 100 percent carbon-free electricity.", "In this, it echoed California’s recent bill SB 100, which committed the state to 100 percent carbon-free energy by 2045.", "The difference is that carbon-free includes not only renewables but also advanced nuclear power plants and fossil fuel power plants with carbon capture and sequestration, either of which Xcel may end up needing to get to 100.", "The company believes that its 2030 goal can be achieved affordably with renewable energy and other technologies currently available.", "However, achieving the long-term vision of zero-carbon electricity requires technologies that are not cost effective or commercially available today.", "That is why Xcel Energy is committed to ongoing work to develop advanced technologies while putting the necessary policies in place to achieve this transition.", "Both sides of this message are incredibly important and poorly understood by the general public.", "First, we have a really good idea of how to get to 80 percent. Climate researcher Christopher Clack and his team showed in 2016 that the entire US could get to 80 percent using existing commercial technologies.", "We know we can get to 80, but 80 is a long, long way off almost everywhere. There is, in other words, no reason to wait.", "And second, we’re not yet sure how to get that last 20 percent, so we need to keep researching new techniques and technologies in the meantime.", "Xcel is going to work with state regulators to try to do some ratepayer-supported R&D. That seems like a really good idea.", "Targeting zero carbon before we know exactly how to achieve it is the kind of aspirational courage that will very much be needed if the US ever gets anything like a Green New Deal.", "A final side note here: Xcel runs two nuclear plants in Minnesota, which provide almost 30 percent of Xcel power in the Upper Midwest.", "Their licenses will be up around 2030. It’s very likely that to stay on track for its carbon targets, Xcel will need to keep those plants running for longer than that.", "Math like this is what has driven a substantial recent shift in opinion among greens about the wisdom of keeping existing nuclear plants open.", "Somewhat by coincidence, the same day Xcel made its announcement, A.P. Moller-Maersk, the world’s largest shipping container company, announced that it will target carbon neutrality by 2050, though, it said, “carbon neutral vessels must be commercially viable by 2030, and an acceleration in new innovations and adaption of new technology is required.”", "This came on the heels, last month, of Google’s announcement that it would strive to run all its operations on 100 percent clean energy, at all times, around the clock.", "There are now hundreds of companies (Ikea, Apple, BMW, Coca-Cola, Facebook, etc.), more than 90 US cities (Minneapolis, Denver, St. Louis, Atlanta, Salt Lake City, etc.), and two US states (Hawaii and California) committed to reaching 100 percent clean electricity.", "This is how the real target — zero net carbon — will arrive in the US: not in a blinding flash or a big federal bill (at least not at first), but like a virus or a meme, catching hold and spreading through contact.", "Researchers have found that both rooftop solar panels and electric vehicles are contagious. People are more likely to buy them when they see other people buying them.", "Human beings are social creatures, not autonomous utility maximizers. We don’t reason through our purchases and our lifestyles; we generally adopt what’s around us and do what people like us do.", "The very same is true of urban policy makers, corporate officers, utility executives, and state regulators.", "You can show them all the charts and graphs you want — until they see others like them doing these things, they won’t feel confident.", "Now more and more people are doing it, and more and more people are seeing other people doing it. The virus is spreading.", "With Xcel and Platte River Power Authority’s news commitments, the virus has spread into the utility industry."]}

Will Renewables and Storage Soon Beat Natural Gas?", "In April 2019, in the heart of coal country, Indiana regulators rejected a proposal by its electric and gas utility, Vectren, to replace baseload coal plants with a new $900 million, 850 megawatt (MW) natural gas-fired power plant.", "Regulators were concerned that with the dramatic decline in the cost of renewable energy, maturation of energy storage and rapidly changing customer demand, such a major gas plant investment could become a stranded, uneconomic asset in the future.", "Regulators are now pushing Vectren to consider more decentralized, lower-carbon resources such as wind, solar and storage that would offer greater resource diversity, flexibility and cost effectiveness.", "This decision is notable in a state where coal is still the primary energy fuel. At the same time, the Indiana decision hints at a broader transformation happening across the United States.", "Coal, the long-reigning king of the U.S. power sector, was officially dethroned by cheap, abundant natural gas in 2016.", "In 2018, natural gas fueled more than 60 percent of newly installed electric-generating capacity and accounted for 35 percent of total U.S. electricity generation.", "But that may be about to change. Natural gas faces intensifying pressure from wind and solar power combined with storage technologies.", "Renewable energy resources such as solar and wind are expected to be the fastest growing source of electricity generation, outpacing gas for at least the next two years.", "Electricity generation from utility-scale solar is expected to grow by 17 percent in 2020 and that from wind by 14 percent during the next two years", "Some Regulators Have Begun Turning Their Backs on New Natural Gas Investments", "Utility regulators from a range of states have begun to question continued investments in new natural gas generation, instead turning to low cost wind and solar.", "Earlier this year, the Arizona Corporation Commission placed a moratorium on new gas plants 150 megawatts (MW) or larger through August 1 of this year.", "In the meantime, the state is considering an energy modernization plan for utilities to source 80% of their electricity from renewables and nuclear by 2050.", "The plan also involves deployment of 3,000 MW of energy storage by 2030, to help provide peak power as an alternative to gas plants that can provide extra power during peak demand periods.", "Last year Arizona regulators also declined to recognize the 15-year IRP filed by the state's investor-owned utilities for their disproportionate reliance on massive gas plants, to the exclusion of more renewable energy.", "Natural gas-fired power plants accounted for approximately half of California's in-state power in 2016, but new gas construction is becoming a rarity as market and policy headwinds intensify.", "The state is pushing its utilities to replace natural gas power plants with renewables and other resources.", "Recently, Southern California Edison (SCE) selected a portfolio of battery plants totaling 195 MW, instead of a 262 MW gas \"peaker\" plant (plants that kick in with additional power when demand for energy is especially high) it had chosen previously.", "In addition, Los Angeles decided to shutter three gas-fired coastal power plants over the next decade; the city will instead invest in renewable energy.", "California is expecting to retire more gas plants in the coming years—1,380 MW of gas power plant capacity to be retired in 2019 and another 4,600 MW in 2020—and they are more likely to be replaced by renewables and storage.", "Colorado's biggest utility, Xcel Energy, announced last year that it would replace 660 MW of coal-fired generation with the biggest package of renewable energy projects ever proposed in the country for an individual coal plant retirement—more than 1,800 MW of wind, solar and battery storage.", "Xcel estimates the transition will save ratepayers between $213 million and $374 million. While Xcel's plan includes the purchase of existing gas plants, it proposes no new gas construction.", "Xcel has also announced plans to go entirely carbon-free by 2050.", "Nevada regulators granted NV Energy permission to construct six major solar projects which, combined with 100 MW in battery storage, would double the state's solar capacity and renewable energy production by 2023.", "In their approval, Nevada's Public Utilities Commission noted that this plan \"best advances Nevada's clean energy goals\" by diversifying fuel sources and decreasing reliance on natural gas.", "In a sign that the transition to a clean energy future is taking place outside of its traditional borders, Virginia regulators rebuked Dominion Energy for overestimating projections of future electricity demand and failing to take into account a number of electricity resources that would lower costs for consumers or are mandated by law.", "For the first time ever, Dominion's integrated resource plan (IRP)—an outline of a utility's resource needs, filed with public utility commissions—was rejected for failing to consider the impacts of energy legislation passed last year.", "That legislation will significantly increase Virginia's renewable capacity and mandates Dominion spend $870 million on energy efficiency.", "Regulators noted there was \"considerable doubt regarding the accuracy and reasonableness of the Company's load forecast,\" which could lead to overinvestment in natural gas infrastructure.", "Why Are Regulators Turning Away from Natural Gas? Economics.", "What explains this growing shift where regulators and utilities look more toward solar, wind and battery storage than natural gas, as they phase out coal generation?", "Part of it is that state policymakers are adopting policies that support the build-out of renewable energy, such as through standards that require utilities to obtain a certain portion of their electricity from zero-emission sources (e.g. renewable portfolio standards) or standalone mandates requiring investor-owned utilities to procure significant amounts of storage.", "New York, for instance, has set an energy storage goal of 3,000 MW by 2030 and the New York Public Service Commission has called upon the state's six investor-owned utilities to conduct competitive solicitations to have a total of 350 MW of energy storage resources in service by end of 2022.", "California, Massachusetts, and New Jersey are a few other states that have established energy storage targets.", "However, the new economics of renewables are a significant factor behind this trend—especially in states that are still heavily fossil fuel-dependent.", "Renewable energy is now undercutting the cost of new natural gas generation in a growing number of regions.", "According to Lazard, a financial advisory firm, the levelized cost of energy (LCOE) for some renewables, especially onshore wind and utility-scale solar, is lower than the cheapest natural gas in many cases, even without subsidies factored in.", "LCOE—measuring the average cost of electricity over the life of a project—is one commonly used metric to compare the costs of different generation technologies.", "As IRENA has noted, however, \"LCOE is a useful metric as a starting point for deeper comparison, it is not necessarily the most useful indicator of cost between different power generation technologies.\"", "The Lazard analysis also presents various caveats on the use of LCOE, e.g., it does not reflect various integration costs or potential social and environmental externalities.", "Research has shown that incremental system costs from adding non-dispatchable renewable generation are minimal up to penetration rates of 80 percent or more as long as appropriate investments are made in transmission and storage.", "Given that renewables produce no CO2 emissions or other air pollutants, and that the current integration costs of renewables are low, one can be confident that renewables will be a low-cost incremental source of generation for years to come.", "Recent data on power purchase agreements show consistency with Lazard's LCOE estimates. In June 2018, NV Energy set a new price record when it entered into a 300 MW power purchase agreement (PPA) with the Eagle Shadow Mountain solar project at $23.76/MWh for 25 years.", "The PPA was approved by Nevada regulators in December 2018. Last year Xcel Energy's all-source solicitation received a batch of bids whose medians were $18.10/MWh for a wind project, $21/MWh for wind plus storage, $29.50/MWh for solar, and $36/MWh for solar plus storage.", "While the cost of renewable and storage varies from market to market, these two examples show that the costs are dropping rapidly and the business case for using renewables in place of natural gas is becoming more compelling in many parts of the country.", "Renewables hold another price advantage over natural gas. Renewable energy costs are expected to continue falling, while the cost of gas generation can be volatile since it is tethered to the commodity price of natural gas.", "In the last 10 years alone, natural gas hit a high of almost $7 per mmBtus and a low of $1.75. (It is currently at $2.65.)", "Renewable energy costs, on the other hand, are forecasted to get cheaper in the coming years (removal of federal tax incentives may cause modest increases in the near term).", "Bloomberg New Energy Finance, in its New Energy Outlook 2019, reported that wind and solar are now cheapest across more than two-thirds of the world and that by 2030 they will \"undercut commissioned coal and gas almost everywhere.\"", "Wood Mackenzie Power & Renewables expects battery prices to fall by more than 80 percent by 2040. Energy storage deployment is forecasted to grow thirteenfold, from a 12 gigawatt-hour market in 2018 to a 158 gigawatt-hour market in 2024, with much of the growth concentrated in the United States and China.", "Finally, investing in new gas plants is beginning to be seen as a risky proposition due to climate change concerns.", "In addition to concerns about methane leakage in natural gas production, building natural gas infrastructure—which has a relatively long lifespan—for the next three decades is beginning to be viewed as in tension with current climate goals.", "Limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees C (2.7 degrees F) above preindustrial levels, which scientists say is necessary for preventing the worst impacts of climate change, requires the United States to achieve carbon neutrality by midcentury.", "This is only possible if power sector emissions fall close to zero. This means that much of the planned and existing oil and gas infrastructure will have to be abandoned before the end of its life or retrofitted to include carbon capture and storage.", "Thus it risks becoming what investors call a \"stranded asset.\" While it is hard to predict what policymakers will do in the future, if a price is put on carbon in the next few years, natural gas's future could become cloudier.", "A report from the Rocky Mountain Institute echoes this concern. In comparing the cost of four proposed gas plants in different parts of the country with regionally appropriate aggregations of renewable energy resources, the analysis finds that, in three of the four cases, the clean energy portfolio would cost 8-60 percent less than the four proposed gas plants today.", "With further cost reductions in clean energy and/or a modest $7.50 per ton price on carbon emissions, renewables will be cheaper in all four cases.", "Natural gas will play a significant role in the nation's future electricity mix in the coming years. The mix of energy sources used for generating electricity will continue to shift in response to changes in fuel costs and the development of renewable energy technologies.", "In parts of the country where natural gas is the most cost-effective energy source to replace coal-fired generation, pure economics and local grid context will dictate utility and energy regulator decisions to invest in new natural gas-fired generation.", "However, as this blog notes, a natural gas-centered energy transition would carry significant economic and environmental risks.", "For years, natural gas has been viewed as a \"bridge fuel,' a cleaner burning, low-cost alternative to coal while zero-emission options are developed.", "And indeed, the transition from coal to natural gas has conferred significant benefits in terms of reducing GHG emissions and air pollution.", "But with renewables quickly catching up to natural gas, could it be that we're getting to the end of the natural gas bridge and approaching the other side?"]}

In most states, it is now often cheaper to build new wind and solar plants (in some cases even when paired with storage) than to operate existing fossil-fuel power plants.", "Utilities are starting to take notice, and renewables are dominating their long-term resource plans. As you can see in the map below, at least nine states plus Puerto Rico and D.C., have now set 100% clean energy targets.", "(For a discussion of this trend and its implications for utilities, regulators, and renewable energy developers, see AEE’s recent webinar, “What Happens When Wind and Solar Win on Price?”).", "To kick off 2019, the New Mexico Public Regulation Commission approved Public Service Co. of New Mexico’s (PNM) latest integrated resource plan (IRP), which calls for the retirement of all coal-fired generation in its portfolio by 2031.", "In Michigan, DTE Electric Co. and Consumers Energy Co. both recently proposed plans to phase out coal by 2040.", "In March, DTE proposed 11 MW of solar-plus-storage projects and 693 MW of wind projects over the next five years, followed by 525 MW of solar between 2025 and 2030 and another 2 GW by 2040.", "In June, the Public Service Commission approved Consumers’ plan, which calls for 5 GW of new solar by 2030 and a 90% reduction in carbon emissions by 2040.", "In April, Public Service Co. of Colorado received approval for the construction of a $743 million, 500 MW wind farm (representing about 8% of its peak summer demand), which the utility aims to bring into commercial operation by the end of 2020, to take advantage of the full value of the federal production tax credit.", "This represents only a small piece of the power company’s expected energy transition over the next couple decades, with the goal of achieving 100% carbon neutral generation by 2050.", "In April, Northern Indiana Public Service Co (NIPSCO) filed a petition for a $21 million annual electric revenue increase, that is premised on its most recent integrated resource plan which proposes to retire all coal in its fleet by 2028 and replace it with a portfolio of solar, storage, wind and demand management.", "NIPSCO stated its plan is expected to save customers $4 billion over the next 30 years.", "In June, Georgia Power reached a settlement agreement in its 2019 Integrated Resource Plan that calls for the retirement of close to 1 GW of coal generating capacity and the procurement of 1.5 GW of renewable resources and 150 MW of distributed generation resources.", "This plan marks the continued steep decline in Georgia Power’s emissions in recent years driven by plant economics, as these planned retirements are in addition to 3.1 GW of already retired coal plants — representing about 20% of its existing peak load.", "Even Mississippi, which historically has not been a hot bed for renewables, is joining the party. At the beginning of the year, Entergy Mississippi filed an application for a $138 million, 100 MW solar facility.", "Entergy said they are pursuing the solar facility because of increasing customer interest and the recent reductions in solar costs.", "If approved, it would be the first large-scale, utility-owned solar project constructed in Mississippi.", "Many states are exploring changes to the traditional cost-of-service regulatory model to move toward a system that better reflects new market conditions, allows utilities to take advantage of the growing service economy, and rewards performance against established goals rather than inputs.", "For more information, take a look at the Navigating Utility Business Model Reform paper and series of case studies AEE Institute released in November, in collaboration with Rocky Mountain Institute and America's Power Plan.", "The case studies highlight utility business model reforms being implemented in the U.S and abroad while the paper lays out a menu of business model reform options and practical guidance for pursuing reform at the state level.", "In January, the Minnesota Public Utilities Commission (PUC) finalized Phase 1 in its performance based regulation (PBR) investigation for the state’s largest utility — Xcel Energy.", "The Commission kicked off Phase 2 in March, which commenced a stakeholder process to create a set of metrics for the five performance outcomes established in Phase 1 – affordability, reliability, customer service quality, environmental performance, and cost-effectively aligning generation to load.", "In January, New York’s Con Edison filed a petition to increase its annual electric and gas delivery revenues.", "A key component of the rate case is the implementation of earnings adjustment mechanisms (EAMs) -- New York’s version of performance incentive mechanisms -- coming out of the Reforming the Energy Vision (REV) initiative.", "The Public Utilities Commission of Hawaii (PUC) concluded Phase 1 and set the groundwork for Phase 2 in its proceeding to develop a new PBR framework for the Hawaiian Electric Companies.", "In May, the PUC issued a Phase 1 decision which identified 12 key outcomes and a portfolio of priority PBR mechanisms for updating Hawaii's regulatory design.", "The Decision established the guiding principles and objectives for Phase 2 to include: (1) setting a revenue target to optimize near-term customer savings; (2) enhancing customer engagement; (3) improving DER performance; (4) streamlining utility performance; and (5) re-aligning financial incentives with societal outcomes (e.g., GHG reductions, transportation electrification, resilience).", "Phase 2 will formally begin in August and focus on revenue adjustment mechanisms and performance mechanisms as the main track for exploring and developing PBR.", "The Colorado Public Utilities Commission will also soon be engaged in re-thinking utility regulation with the passage of SB 236 — the PUC Sunset bill signed into law in May.", "Among other things, the bill requires the PUC to study the impacts of performance-based metrics to better understand and identify mechanisms that would encourage the state’s utilities to make investment decisions that benefit the public good, increase energy savings, and improve safety and reliability.", "The bill also authorizes the creation of a ratepayer-backed bonding mechanism (securitization) to expedite the closure of outmoded power plants as the state transitions to cleaner, more economic resources.", "In addition to these efforts to rethink utility business models and regulation on a broad basis, many states have taken on specific aspects of reforming how utilities conduct their planning and operations, such as distribution system planning (see #3) and procuring non-wires alternatives to traditional utility investments (see #4).", "3. Distribution System Planning for Distributed Resources", "The distribution grid is the backbone of a reliable electric system used to deliver electricity from the transmission system to individual consumers.", "Modern planning processes are critical for providing essential electric service efficiently and cost-effectively.", "As DER deployment continues to grow, utilities and DER companies are seeking ways to maximize the benefits of DERs to the system, while maintaining reliability and reasonable costs for customers.", "New York and California have continued to refine their distribution system planning processes in 2019, while several additional states have taken steps to implement processes of their own.", "In February, the New Hampshire Public Utilities Commission staff issued a report with a recommended approach for utilities to assess their distribution systems, conduct least-cost distribution planning strategies, and incorporate grid modernization initiatives.", "In April, Ohio's utilities (AEP Ohio, Duke Energy, and FirstEnergy) filed their grid architecture status reports, as required by the Public Utility Commission of Ohio's PowerForward roadmap, to identify where each utility stands on its path to a modern grid.", "The reports differ widely from utility to utility. Most notably, FirstEnergy's report is noticeably shorter and less comprehensive than the other utilities' reports.", "That said, topics in the reports range from a status report on grid architecture (i.e., field automation, substation automation, operational communications infrastructure, sensing and measurement, operational analytics, and standardized access to customer energy usage data) to an assessment of distribution system planning practices and ability to integrate new technologies.", "In addition to the actions mentioned above, a few other states have continued their existing distribution system planning investigations in 2019, including Hawaii, Michigan, and Minnesota.", "One of the core outputs of distribution system planning is recognizing opportunities for new advanced technologies and services to meet system needs — which we explore next.", "4. Non-Wires Alternatives to Traditional Utility Investments", "Non-wires alternatives (NWAs) to traditional investments in transmission and distribution equipment are increasingly being looked to as viable options in several key states.", "The next steps to making NWAs a widespread reality are to (1) identify the areas where NWAs can meet a need at a lower cost than a traditional utility investment, and (2) develop a framework to implement and/or procure the NWA solution.", "Several states have made significant progress so far in 2019.", "In January 2019, Con Edison in New York outlined its plan to continue implementation of its Brooklyn Queens Demand Management (BQDM) program through 2021.", "The utility plans to continue procurement of additional load reduction above the original 41 MW of non-traditional customer-side electricity demand reduction solutions (projecting 44.5 MW by 2021) and 11 MW of non-traditional utility-side solutions (projecting 18 MW by 2021).", "For a deep dive on the BQDM program and its success so far, see AEE’s case study here.", "In June 2018, Central Maine Power and Emera Maine filed recommendations that would eliminate their existing incentive to favor transmission and distribution (T&D) investments over NWAs.", "Specifically, they called for: 1) a revenue decoupling mechanism, 2) a ratemaking approach to treat NWA investments in a similar manner to T&D investments, and 3) an approval process for NWA proposals.", "As a follow-on to those recommendations, the utilities were ordered to submit supplemental filings in March outlining how they consider and implement NWAs are part of their T&D investment planning processes.", "In May, the California Public Utilities Commission issued a ruling modifying the distribution investment deferral framework process, an annual process (first implemented in 2018) to identify, review, and select opportunities for third party-owned DERs to defer or avoid traditional capital investments.", "As part of the ruling, the CPUC streamlined the planning process to reduce the time associated with stakeholder participation.", "The Commission ordered utilities to file their grid needs assessment – identifying the technical and operational planning needs they need to meet five-year load growth forecasts – and a distribution deferral opportunity report – identifying utilities’ planned investments and opportunities for third party-owned DERs to avoid or defer those investments by August.", "5. Wildfire Liability Challenging California Utilities", "In January, the largest investor-owned utility in California — Pacific Gas & Electric (PG&E) — filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy because of accrued liabilities resulting from the devastating wildfires of 2018.", "As part of the bankruptcy process, PG&E sought and received approval for $5.5 billion in financing to support operations and ongoing safety initiatives during the bankruptcy process.", "There are still a lot of unanswered questions that will need to be sorted out through the courts. One of the most important questions for the advanced energy industry will be whether PG&E is granted the ability to renegotiate a portion of their existing $34.5 billion in renewable energy contracts to help pay down their debts.", "A decision that could encumber California’s efforts to meet its clean energy and greenhouse gas reduction goals.", "Outside of the bankruptcy process, the wildfires kick started wide ranging investigations into wildfire prevention and cost recovery plans, as well as PG&E’s safety culture.", "At the start of the year, the California Public Utilities Commission opened an investigation to determine if PG&E, as currently constituted, is able to provide safe electric and gas service and to review alternatives to PG&E's current management and operational structures.", "As a result of that investigation, the Commission established a Commission Advisory Panel of experts to advise the Commission on corporate governance issues to ensure that utilities are prioritizing safety moving forward.", "More pointedly, the Commission in late June introduced four proposals (which the Commission is currently seeking comments on) to improve PG&E’s safety culture.", "The four proposed pathways include: (1) separating PG&E into separate gas and electric utilities or selling the gas assets; (2) establishing periodic review of PG&E’s Certificate of Convenience and Necessity (CPCN) to operate as a monopoly in California; (3) modifying or eliminating PG&E's holding company structure; and (4) linking PG&E’s rate of return or return on equity to safety performance metrics.", "If adopted, any one of these pathways would have wide-ranging implications.", "Also in June, the CPUC adopted a set of criteria and a methodology for conducting a financial “stress test” for future wildfire cost recovery.", "The methodology is intended to inform determinations of the maximum amount an electric corporation can pay without affecting their ability to raise money in capital markets, which could ultimately harm ratepayers or affect their ability to provide safe and adequate service.", "As renewable energy has become more competitive on price, customers are increasingly looking for ways to not only power their operations with 100% renewable energy, but also dampen price volatility and reduce energy costs.", "There are several avenues for customers to increase their access to renewable energy ranging from direct access programs to renewable energy tariffs to community solar programs.", "(For a discussion of best practices and steps that states and utilities can take to meet large customer demand for renewable energy, see the Advanced Energy Buyers Group’s recent report here.)", "In January, Xcel Energy in Minnesota filed for approval to expand their Renewable*Connect Pilot Program (a renewable energy tariff aimed at businesses that want access to renewable energy) into a full-fledged program.", "Xcel stated that the pilot sold out in one year and there are more than 400 customers on a waiting list.", "In March, the California Public Utilities Commission opened a rulemaking to implement SB 237, reopening of the state’s direct access (DA) program.", "The DA program, which has been limited to about 11% of peak load since 2010, allows retail nonresidential customers to purchase electricity service directly from competitive providers.", "In June, the Commission issued a Phase 1 order to expand the DA cap by 4 TWh or an additional 2% to 3% of peak load allocated proportionally to the investor-owned utilities' service territories.", "Phase 2, which is expected to begin before the end of the year, will be focused on the second requirement of SB 237, issuing recommendations to the Legislature on a full expansion of the DA cap to nonresidential customers by June 1, 2020.", "In May, Dominion Energy In Virginia filed an application for a 100% renewable energy tariff that would allow customers with under 5 MW of peak demand to receive 100% of their energy and capacity from a portfolio of renewable resources owned or procured by Dominion for a premium over standard service.", "In March, Florida Power & Light (FP&L) proposed a solar subscription program — SolarTogether. The program would give customers of all rate classes the option to subscribe to blocks of solar capacity (with no long-term commitment) from dedicated 74.5 MW solar power plants.", "FPL stated it has already pre-registered 200 customers, totaling 1,000 MW, for the program, mostly from commercial and industrial customers.", "Community choice aggregation (CCA) or municipal aggregation has been around for a few decades but it has risen in popularity the past couple of years, driven in large part by communities wishing to take control over how their energy is generated.", "The concept of CCA is fairly simple. CCAs are classified as governmental entities, most often formed by cities and/or counties, that procure power on behalf of their residents.", "While the CCA provides power for residents, the designated utility still continues to provide transmission and distribution service in the area.", "In California, CPUC staff has estimated that by 2025 over 85% of California’s IOU retail load could be served by Community Choice Aggregators and other DA providers (up from about 20% today).", "On the opposite coast, New York recently refined its framework to make it easier to form CCAs, which has led to several municipalities filing implementation plans.", "In January, the Massachusetts Department of Public Utilities (DPU) opened an investigation into improving the retail electric competitive supply market in Massachusetts, including increasing customer awareness of the competitive market and the value it can provide.", "In June, the DPU established two working groups which, among other things, will focus on improvements to the Energy Switch website, including but not limited to the display of municipal aggregation products.", "This is a timely investigation, as in June, the City of Boston petitioned the DPU to approve a community choice aggregation plan to procure power on behalf of its residents.", "If approved, the plan would allow the City to solicit the necessary power in October 2019 and start service in January 2020.", "The deployment of electric vehicle (EV) charging infrastructure has risen to the fore in many jurisdictions, as improvements in technology have dramatically expanded the EV market and PUCs have continued to develop focused transportation electrification strategies.", "(For more information on what utility commissioners need to know about the accelerating EV market, see AEE’s EV issue brief.)", "California continues to lead on transportation electrification (TE), with 49% of the nation’s electric car sales originating in the Golden State.", "At the turn of the year, the California Public Utilities Commission initiated a rulemaking to provide more structure and guidance on future transportation electrification investments and to streamline the application process.", "Under California’s existing construct, all utility applications have been considered on a case-by-case basis, which has led to a prolonged review process and unfocused investment strategy.", "This new process, referred to as the DRIVE OIR, seeks to develop a TE framework that will help to strategically integrate TE load; enhance market coordination of utility investments; enable private sector investments; achieve policy cohesiveness on key issues (i.e., rate design, consumer education, and vehicle-grid integration (VGI) policy); and evaluate cost effectiveness of investments and different ownership and cost recovery models.", "A staff proposal for a TE framework is expected to be issued in October.", "In January, the Public Service Commission of Wisconsin opened an investigation to consider policies and regulations in regards to EVs and their associated supply infrastructure in Wisconsin.", "In February, the Missouri Public Service Commission opened a proceeding to evaluate potential mechanisms for utility involvement in EV charging stations.", "The proceeding seeks to evaluate the following three models: (1) utility owned and operated charging stations; (2) a utility “make ready” option; and (3) an alternative incentive program where program parameters, implementation, and cost recovery would be evaluated and defined in a future rate proceeding.", "In February, the New York Public Service Commission issued an order approving a proposed incentive program to encourage the deployment of public direct current fast charging (DCFC) stations.", "The consensus proposal – which was jointly filed by the state's utilities, the New York Power Authority, the Department of Environmental Conservation, the Department of Transportation, the New York State Thruway Authority, and the New York State Energy Research and Development Authority (NYSERDA) – will provide $31.6 million in incentives for over 1,000 publicly accessible DCFC charging stations.", "Specifically, each utility will offer an annual per-plug incentive that will decline over time as electric vehicle usage, and thus DCFC utilization, increases.", "In June, the Vermont Public Utility Commission submitted a report to the state legislature recommending the removal of barriers to the adoption of EVs, including more EV purchase incentives, easier pathways for the installation of public charging infrastructure, and increased education and outreach.", "The Arizona Corporation Commission (ACC) has also been in the thick of developing an EV policy implementation plan in 2019 that provides guidelines for utilities to propose EV pilot programs focused on structure, education and outreach, make-ready, rate design, incentives/rebates, and cost recovery.", "There has been no shortage of activity across the country with utility proposals or statewide investigations in Colorado, Delaware, Iowa, Maryland, Michigan (DTE Electric and Consumers Energy) Minnesota, North Carolina, Oregon, South Carolina (Duke Energy Progress and Duke Energy Carolinas), and Texas.", "For an overview of the benefits of electrifying transportation, with a specific focus on the medium- and heavy-duty vehicle sector, see our recently released industry fact sheet here.", "9. Grid Modernization Investments for DER and Large-Scale Renewables", "Grid modernization is often used in the electricity industry as a catch-all term for grid investment.", "However, at AEE, we view grid modernization as comprising the foundational investments needed to enable a reliable and flexible grid.", "Such a modern grid platform is essential to fully integrating DER, balancing increasing levels of large-scale renewables and enhancing the customer experience.", "The first step toward grid modernization is often advanced metering infrastructure. In May, Indiana Michigan Power took this first step by filing an application in Indiana as part of a larger general rate case asking for full smart meter deployment by 2022.", "Other states are looking at grid modernization more holistically. In March, the Arkansas Public Service Commission kicked off a long-awaited DER and grid modernization investigation.", "The first phase of the investigation will inform stakeholders on the existing state of the grid, including aging distribution infrastructure, the role of data in a modern grid, and the impact of DER on utility planning and operation.", "Meanwhile in the District of Columbia, six working groups with over 100 participants across industry, government, consulting, and advocacy groups met from August 2018 to May 2019, working through a variety of issues facing its electric power system.", "The collaborative process focused on identifying technologies and policies that can modernize its energy delivery system for increased sustainability and make it more reliable, efficient, cost-effective and interactive.", "In May, the process culminated in a final stakeholder report with 32 recommendations (i.e., more fundamental reforms that require further discussion) for consideration by the PSC related to data and information access and alignment, non-wire alternatives, rate design, utility business model reform, customer impacts, microgrids, and pilot projects.", "Net energy metering (NEM) has been successful in spurring the adoption of distributed generation across the country.", "As net metering-eligible resources continue to decline in price, the number of NEM customers has increased, which has led to pushback in many jurisdictions.", "Over the past couple of years, states have taken various approaches to successor tariffs to NEM, ranging from reductions in net metering rates for exported electricity to the development of regulatory structures to more precisely value and source services from DER (see #10, of last year’s Top 10).", "This year, one example of the holistic approach to NEM reconsideration can be found in Connecticut, where in June the Department of Energy and Environmental Protection (DEEP) and the Public Utilities Regulatory Authority (PURA) opened a proceeding to study the value of DER as required by Public Act 19-35.", "DEEP and PURA are required to submit a report on their findings to the General Assembly by July 2020.", "Other states, however, seem to be moving in a direction that is not favorable to future DER adoption.", "In January, the Louisiana Public Service Commission Staff proposed a rule that would compensate new net metering customers at avoided cost, rather than the retail rate, though also promising payment for any quantifiable locational, capacity-related, or environmental benefits.", "In April, Idaho Power filed a petition to suspend net metering service and explore modifications to the compensation structure under its net metering program, affecting customer-owned generation facilities with capacity up to 100 kW, even though existing net metered capacity represents just 0.15% of the utility’s summer peak demand of 3,400 MW.", "Idaho Power expressed concern that capacity under its net metering tariff had increased 114% in the first quarter of 2019 alone, driven by large commercial, industrial, and irrigation customers, with capacity from the irrigation class jumping from 1.09 MW to 5.06 MW.", "No decision has been made to date, but if the Public Utilities Commission sides with the utility, it could nip Idaho distributed generation in the bud.", "On a more positive note, New York recently made some landmark adjustments that should provide fairer treatment for customers that have significant distributed generation facilities.", "In April, the Commission issued an order that made revisions to the state’s DER value calculation and compensation methodology, and also adopted a new credit to encourage community distributed generation development.", "And in May, the Commission issued an order modifying the current standby and buyback service rates that will improve the alignment between system costs and how DER customers make use of the grid, which should ultimately improve the prospects for DER deployment.", "(For a more detailed look at this order, read more here.)", "Keep up-to-date on all regulatory action with AEE's PowerSuite.

Governor Polis is one of five governors who ran on a 100-percent-renewable energy platform.", "This is the first time in the history of our nation that governors have used that in their campaigning.”", "Of the newly inaugurated governors, Polis may have the most ambitious goal for his state.

The Colorado Department of Transportation predicts that, by 2020, Colorado’s transportation sector will account for 33 percent of the state’s greenhouse gas emissions.", "Currently, Colorado has a Low-Emission Vehicle Standard that reduces greenhouse gas emissions and smog-forming pollutants from passenger vehicles.", "As a next step, Colorado is looking into adopting a Zero Emissions Vehicle (ZEV) program which would require approximately 7 percent of new vehicle sales in the state be electric vehicles by 2025.", "Helfrich said one of Polis’s first acts as governor was an executive order mandating that Colorado’s Air Quality Control Commission move forward on the consideration of the ZEV program by this May.", "This would allow Colorado to take the lead on capturing the economic-development potential of electric vehicles.", "This objective would include a wide range of benefits. First, cost savings would accrue for businesses and consumers on fuel and maintenance.", "Second, the development of the electric vehicle supply chain would accelerate, bringing jobs in manufacturing.", "Third, the installation and management of charging infrastructure would catalyze development.", "This is a change Ceres staff say will help the state reduce emissions. It is also a move that many of Ceres’s corporate partners are saying will lead to economic opportunity for the business community.", "While Polis has said the 100-percent-renewable goal by 2040 is “aspirational,” there have been some key recent moves that could make it a reality.", "Most prominently, Xcel Energy, the state’s major utility, became the first utility to announce a plan to become carbon-neutral by 2050.", "Helfrich said this Colorado move is “unique.” This is not just because Xcel Energy’s plan would help the state recalibrate its energy portfolio towards more renewable energy.", "Xcel Energy’s Colorado Energy Plan would also lead to the early retirement of two coal plants. This would result in paying off the loss of those plants early.", "This was made possible by the fact that Xcel Energy had received record low bids on renewable energy and energy storage projects, Helfrich said.", "These clean energy resources were so affordable that it was cheaper for the utility to build in more clean energy from scratch than to continue operating the two coal plants it now plans to retire.", "The cost-effectiveness of these renewable energy and energy storage projects shows how the economics of clean energy are shifting across the country.", "New Mexico Has Scarce Solar Incentives but Plentiful Solar Opportunities", "According to National Renewable Energy Laboratory, New Mexico ranks second in solar statewide annual average irradiance in the United States.", "This suggests that New Mexico would be a prime market for market expansion.", "“Governor Lujan Grisham feels strongly that we can’t currently rely on the federal government,” said Nora Sackett, a spokeswoman for the governor.", "“States should lead the charge in fighting climate change and implementing clean energy policy – and as such, it’s an important part of her platform.”", "Policy-wise, there’s a lot of work to be done. While New Mexico offers a property-tax exemption for solar energy and net metering, there is little being done to use that solar irradiance.", "Work needs to be done to incentivize developers to bring additional solar projects to the state.", "During her campaign, Michelle Lujan Grisham said New Mexico should become a leader in clean energy. Currently, the state has about 777 MW of solar energy installed, according to SEIA.", "Sackett said Lujan Grisham will have a few clean energy-policy priorities. She has said she hopes to raise New Mexico’s Renewable Portfolio Standard to 50 percent by 2030 and 80 percent by 2040.", "In addition, the administration has said it hopes to invest in transmission infrastructure and explore interstate energy markets.", "The governor also wants to have the state export to high-demand markets like Arizona and California.", "During Lujan Grisham’s State of the State Address, she also committed to a methane-mitigation rule. She also said the state will join the U.S. Climate Alliance to show New Mexico’s commitment to climate and energy goals.", "“Governor Lujan Grisham is committed to making New Mexico a leader in clean energy across the board,” Sackett said.", "“This includes investing in clean energy infrastructure like wind and solar, raising the Renewable Portfolio Standard, growing the green jobs workforce in New Mexico with specific education and training programs, and implementing methane mitigation.”", "Kansas Has a Small Renewable Energy Base but an Interesting Political Dynamic", "When Governor Laura Kelly took office in early January, she inherited a state with perhaps one of the most interesting energy mixes in the country.", "According to the Kansas Corporation Commission (KCC), which oversees utility regulation in the state, half of the state’s electricity was powered by coal resources in 2017.", "The second highest power source is wind energy, which makes up nearly one-third of all the state’s electricity generation.", "The Energy Information Administration noted that Kansas is leading the charge in wind energy, ranking among the top five states for wind production in 2017.", "When it comes to state policy for both solar and wind, Kansas has been offering renewable developers and consumers very little.", "While Kansas offers a form of net metering and renewable energy tax exemption, there is very little in terms of incentives or rebates.", "While wind energy is plentiful due to the natural environment of this Great Plains state, Kansas only had a mere 27 MW of solar installed as of Q3 2018.", "With a divided government, Kansas is unlikely to push forward massive renewable energy legislation. However, having a Democratic governor is likely to result in her appointing two commissioners whose perspective she supports to the Kansas Corporation Commission.", "During a debate in the run-up to the election, Kelly said she would nominating commissioners who “keep the consumer in mind” as well as paying attention to the companies that they are responsible for regulating.", "Helfrich said this change could pay dividends a bit further down the road. “The biggest thing [moving forward] for the KCC is for energy efficiency.”", "Kelly can appoint “commissioners who want to see energy efficiency.”", "In the past, these commissioners have rejected plans from utilities that would account for these efficiency changes.", "Now, Helfrich said she believes that Kelly can select commissioners over the next few years who can change that trajectory over the long term.", "Despite her previous votes for increasing renewable energy, Kelly’s campaign website avoided the topic of increasing clean energy sources altogether.", "While Ceres has not engaged in Kansas as much as it has in other target states, Helfrich said that she is aware Kelly believes climate change is happening and knows that it is a big issue.", "Kelly has expressed support for wind power in the past.", "States Can Transform Renewable Energy Markets If Their Leaders Take Initiative", "The last major energy law was passed in the United States Congress in 2007. Since then, while efforts have been made by the Obama and Trump administrations through executive actions or unrelated bills, states have had to adjust to shifting federal policy priorities.", "Thus far, for states like California, Massachusetts and New York, the ability to influence clean energy through policy has allowed for major expansions of renewable energy resources.", "With the continued decline of installation costs for solar and wind, it now appears possible that state markets that did not have heavy policy levers previously can take advantage of these cost declines.", "“Upgrading and expanding transmission infrastructure is a key area where progress will help meet consumer demand for low-cost clean energy and provide new economic-investment opportunities in rural America,” Darin said when he described AWEA’s hopes for what the new governors will focus on in terms of wind energy policy.", "As always, the devil is in the implementation. Yet in two years’ time, the list of states with successful clean energy markets may surprise you.", "Summing up the opportunity for governors across the country, Helfrich said that clean energy policy change is imperative.", "“Changing the rules so that companies can do this is huge. They know that the state rules are relevant and they want to make those investments.”", "Explaining the role of Ceres and other advocates, Helfrich said: “Our role is to help [companies] identify the policy barriers and where they can shift them… to show decision-makers that this is about economics.”", "To comment on this article, please post in our LinkedIn group, contact us on Twitter, or use our contact form."]}
