Our labs are operational and from a manufacturing and a clinical standpoint, we're proceeding and proceeding well.", "In DAZZLE, as we'll discuss in more detail, patient missed visit rates are less than 5% and clinical trial sites continue to enroll new patients.", "This is a testament to the serious diseases that we're attempting to treat here at Kodiak and it's a vote of confidence from the patients, physicians and the study sites who are partnering with us to advance KSI-301 toward the market.", "As John mentioned, removing non-cash charges, our monthly burn rate this past quarter was only $6 million per month.", "So with over $430 million in cash and equivalents at quarter end, we remain on a very strong financial footing.", "Now, as of today, we did delay initiation of our next set of KSI-301 pivotal studies by one quarter. We were planning first-in-human in the June-July timeframe and we've now shifted that planned first-in-human for the additional pivotals for KSI-301 to the September-October timeframe of this year.", "Now, we're using this time wisely, not just to assess with physicians and our business partners how best to minimize the impact of COVID-19 on clinical trial conduct, but one, to optimize our pivotal study designs; two, to engage with regulators on upgrades to the pivotal program; and three, working with our partner companies, in particular, on manufacturing and clinical, in terms of execution and the structure of our relationships there to put them in the best possible structure for this next stage or phase of escalation and acceleration of Kodiak's growth.", "Importantly, our 2022 vision toward a BLA filing in the key retinal disease indications remains intact.", "And as I mentioned, we've taken good advantage of the additional quarter, this additional time to upgrade our pivotal study plan for KSI-301, and Jason will discuss that in more detail.", "In summary though, we now intend to conduct two Phase 3 studies in DME, diabetic macular edema, and one study in wet AMD, our ongoing DAZZLE study, and one study in RVO, and one study in non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy.", "There are multiple reasons for this shift into two DME studies and one RVO from our earlier plan where we had proposed two RVO studies and one DME study.", "On the operational front, with this new plan, we expect a more predictable execution of the studies and of the pipeline in the plan.", "In other words, we expect the clin ops component of the DME studies to be faster, simpler and more predictable.", "And we also believe, we'll be able to run the studies in fewer countries and fewer research sites, which is an important simplification.", "This returns predictability to the program. And it's particularly important in light of COVID-19 especially in the ex-US geographies.", "Further, we prefer to shift resources on the margin into the higher prevalence, higher unmet need disease of DME rather than RVO.", "DME remains the leading cause of blindness in working age adults in the US and the EU.", "Importantly, the data that continues to emerge in our Phase 1b study remained very consistent with observations that we shared in February and we look forward to providing a next R&D update on the Phase 1b data in July of this year.", "That will either be virtually at the American Society of Retina Specialists meeting, in other words either in person at the meeting or if that goes virtual either through one of our partnered clinicians, right or through a Webex similar to this.", "Operationally, we've taken steps in line with guidance from CDC and the State of California to protect the health and safety of our employees in the community.", "And Kodiak as a company we've implemented remote work arrangements for non-essential employees since March 17th.", "Notably, though, as I mentioned, we continue to be operational in our laboratories.", "I'd like to pause here and hand the call over to Jason. Jason, could you talk about how we're managing ongoing clinical trials through COVID-19 and also introduce the new KSI-301 pivotal study program.", "Jason Ehrlich -- Chief Medical Officer and Chief Development Officer", "Well, thanks, Victor, and good afternoon to everyone. Thanks for joining us. Yeah, so, over the last few months, the Kodiak team has been focused on ensuring both patient safety and data integrity in our ongoing KSI-301 clinical trials.", "The Phase 1b study, which is in patients with DME, RVO and wet AMD and then DAZZLE, our pivotal study in wet AMD that compares KSI-301 to standard of care aflibercept.", "So we've made numerous enhancements into the ongoing study execution and planning really to help ensure the safety of patients, physicians, study site staff and Kodiak operations team members as much as possible.", "So some of the specific actions that we've taken include the use of remote study monitoring, we've temporarily increased study site budget overhead rates to help with additional time that's required for the studies and to procure the appropriate PPE and so on, providing additional transportation service options for patients to make sure that they can safely and comfortably attend the study visits, and we've also been focusing new patient enrollment only at the study sites that have appropriate backup resource plans in place, and importantly, where the local COVID-19 situation allows.", "So we've been actively monitoring the ongoing trial participation and we're really being as proactive as we can, both with the study sites, our corporate partners such as our CRO and logistics vendors as well as regulatory authorities to safeguard study integrity and promptly respond to potential disruptions.", "And in light of the efforts undertaken by our investigators and their teams as well as our team and the high risk of permanent vision loss that's presented by the retinal diseases that we're trying to treat with KSI-301, I'm happy to say that existing patients continue to participate with very few missed visits to date less than 5% missed visits in overall in March and April and our new patients continue to be enrolled in the ongoing DAZZLE study in the US again where it makes sense based on the local COVID situation to do so.", "Maybe just some additional color on the efforts that retina specialists and their staff are making to try to continue and see patients who need anti-VEGF therapy, as well as the seriousness of those diseases.", "The pattern that we see in our studies is also reinforced by EMR data that's collected by Western Health and others, that's been published recently.", "So you may have seen that overall ophthalmology outpatient visits in the US were down by some 80% in March and April and retina specialty clinics themselves saw declines of over 45% in patient visits in March and early April.", "But the proportion of those visits that were for anti-VEGF administration was up substantially, so meaning that the retina specialists were prioritizing patients who need anti-VEGF therapy and they continue to do so.", "So, I think this really highlights the importance of KSI-301. A safe and long-acting therapy can help keep patients on therapy in between less frequent office visits and potentially improve real world outcomes over time, particularly in the setting where it may become more difficult to readily access the clinic such as this pandemic.", "So then back to DAZZLE then, as of May 8th, 2020, 245 patients have been enrolled into DAZZLE and through most of the first quarter, recruitment into the study was very robust, the reflection, I think on the enthusiasm for KSI-301 on the part of investigators and patients as well as underscoring the unmet need for long-acting therapy.", "So, currently, we do not intend to pause screening or enrollment into DAZZLE in the US, but we are seeing slower patient enrollment compared to the 50-plus patients per month that we saw in February and March.", "As part of the COVID measures that I discussed earlier, we issued guidance encouraging study sites to prioritize participation of currently enrolled patients over enrolling new ones if necessary, for example, due to staffing limitations or site closures during the pandemic.", "And then as of late April, the number of weekly new patient screenings and enrollment at DAZZLE sites in the US is increasing and I note that we also see that in the Western EHR data that was published last week showing that retina clinic volume is starting to turn around in the US.", "On the European side, in the first quarter of 2020, we had actually activated DAZZLE study sites in Europe, but then due to the pandemic, we deferred to start a patient screening, but we do now expect to begin patient recruitment activities at certain sites in Europe in the second quarter of 2020 again as guided by the local COVID-19 situation.", "And then finally, with respect to DAZZLE, I'm pleased that the Independent Data Monitoring Committee met in early May and recommended that DAZZLE continue without modification.", "As you know, the IDMC is the group responsible for safeguarding interests of DAZZLE study participants, assessing safety during the trial and monitoring overall study conduct and we're grateful for their support and as well as their recommendation.", "So then turning to the rest of the pivotal program, in the interest of monitoring the progress and impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, as Victor mentioned, we delayed the initiation of the next set of KSI-301 pivotal studies for DME and RVO into September and October of this year versus the previously planned June-July timeframe.", "We're still evaluating whether we can initiate the NPDR without DME study on the same timeframe. We're expecting the potential for a one quarter to two quarter delay, additional delay in the NPDR study start due to the pandemic resulting in deferral of diagnosis and follow up in the NPDR patients.", "As you know, those patients have a lower overall disease severity than patients with wet AMD, DME and RVO.", "So, more on this in a few minutes. Additionally, I'd like to note that our supply chain and manufacturing activities remain intact and we don't currently anticipate disruptions to our supply of KSI-301 due to the pandemic.", "Moving away from COVID-19 then, let me turn the call back to John to go through some additional recent business highlights.", "John Borgeson -- Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Thank you, Jason. As many of you may remember, we announced an agreement for the sale of future royalties of KSI-301 for $225 million on December 1, 2019.", "During the first quarter of 2020, we closed on the first payment under the agreement, receiving $100 million on February 4th of 2020.", "I'd also like to say a few words about our Board of Directors. In the last several months, we've made two strong additions to our Board with the addition of Dr. Taiyin Yang and most recently Charlie Bancroft.", "Taiyin currently serves as Executive Vice President of Pharmaceutical Development and Manufacturing at Gilead and brings deep experience and leadership with commercial manufacturing and quality operations.", "Charlie was formerly the Chief Financial Officer of BMS and brings a wealth of pharmaceutical, commercial and financial experience.", "The combined experience of Taiyin and Charlie supplement an already deep and a well-rounded Board with knowledge that will be instrumental as we accelerate our planning toward BLA and commercial launch.", "Lastly, I would like to quickly comment on the continued progress with our IP portfolio. Most recently, we received full registration of our trademarks, Kodiak and Kodiak Sciences, with the US Patent and Trademark Office, for our exclusive use, further establishing our name recognition as a leader in research and development of medicines to treat and prevent retinal diseases.", "With that, let me turn back to Jason to further elaborate on more clinical highlights. Jason?", "Jason Ehrlich -- Chief Medical Officer and Chief Development Officer", "Thanks, John. So with respect to the Phase 1b study, we presented updated safety, efficacy and durability data from the ongoing Phase 1b trial of KSI-301 at the Angiogenesis meeting back in February, and we believe that the data continue to support the highly differentiated anti-VEGF Generation 2.0 profile of KSI-301.", "We plan to continue presenting data updates from the Phase 1b study throughout this year and if meetings or conferences [Phonetic] are canceled due to COVID or become virtual, we would anticipate one or more virtual R&D webinars where new data will be presented.", "So as Victor mentioned, we're pleased with the data that continue to be generated in the Phase 1b and we look forward to providing the next important R&D update in July, either at the ASRS meeting, depending on whether and how that meeting occurs or else at a virtual R&D webinar in a similar timeframe.", "And as we collect additional follow-up data on patients in the Phase 1b out to nine months, 12 months and beyond, the focus of those presentations will start to turn toward long-term outcomes and the durability of the durability, if you will.", "So we look forward to sharing those upcoming data with you over the course of the year starting with the presentation in July.", "And then furthermore, on the Phase 1b, again, based on positive feedback from investigators and a desire to continue to generate long-term safety and efficacy outcomes data with KSI-301, we further amended the Phase 1b program to include an additional 18 months of treatment and follow-up per patient for a total of up to 36 months.", "And I'd note also that in the Phase 1b study alone, we're now approaching 100 patient years of exposure with KSI-301 and continue to be very pleased with the safety profile that we're seeing.", "So then moving on to talk about the KSI-301 pivotal program, following our communications with FDA at the time of the end of Phase 2 meeting, as well as subsequently, we further upgraded the pivotal study program.", "And as Victor mentioned, we now intend to conduct two Phase 3 studies in diabetic macular edema to provide the mutually confirmatory studies required by FDA for initial demonstration of safety and efficacy.", "And then one pivotal study in wet AMD, ongoing DAZZLE study, one in retinal vein occlusion and one in non-proliferative DR without DME.", "So by conducting the paired studies in DME, we're able to generate additional data on the safety, efficacy and durability of KSI-301 in this area of high unmet need and commercial opportunity, while also narrowing the number of sites and countries that's required for successful enrollment of the entire pivotal program.", "So we expect a majority of research sites to be located in the US with contributions from certain countries in Europe, China and potentially Israel.", "Given that we're currently seeing continued new patient enrollment and low missed visit rates in DAZZLE in the US through the pandemic, we believe that refocusing the KSI-301 program and narrowing our the focus in terms of number of sites and countries will really help us minimize uncertainty with respect to trial conduct during and through the pandemic toward our 2022 vision.", "Few additional specific reasons for running of the paired DME pivotals and one RVO as opposed to the other way around included fewer countries and sites needed for two DME studies versus two RVO studies, which will help with both the cost and logistical burdens of opening and supporting trial sites that might only be needed to participate in the RVO studies.", "Next, I think we'll have better overall oversight of operational execution. Essentially, all of the sites that we're running our studies in can concurrently enroll naive patients in wet AMD, DME or RVO.", "I think we'll have a lower probability of COVID-related disruptions over time, since the scope of countries and sites is more focused.", "As Victor mentioned, there is a higher unmet need in DME compared to RVO and then it's a marginal if any increase in overall trial execution costs, on given the similar timeframes for two DME studies versus two RVOs.", "And then on top of those really operational considerations, we remain quite pleased with the DME clinical data that we're seeing in the Phase 1b study and we want to align the area of greater clinical data generation in DME, given the large number of diabetic patients and the higher unmet need there as compared to RV -- excuse me, as compared to RVO.", "Now, we've been asked if we're going to make a change to the pivotal program planning, why make it two DME studies as opposed to two wet AMD studies?", "And we think two DME studies makes more sense for a couple of important reasons. First is, from a statistical perspective, the standard deviations are narrower in DME and a non-inferiority margin is 4.5 letters in DME for a comparison to aflibercept whereas it's 4 letters little bit narrower in wet AMD.", "So when you add those things up, an additional wet AMD study would require at least 100 more patients than the DME study, now would be a fairly substantial cost difference.", "Cost is not, of course really the only driving factor or a driving factor.", "When we look at what's happening in the community with so many people who are unemployed due to COVID and potentially losing access to their healthcare, working age people, the opportunity to participate in the clinical trial where they can have access to high quality care to retina specialists for the two-year duration of the study, I think that's also important.", "And that should, so we believe that the two DME studies should recruit relatively quickly, especially in this environment, and also wet AMD patients, given that they are quite elderly are really almost at the highest risk of COVID-related complications, so to the extent that those people are less willing to go to the physician, again, we think focusing the two studies on DME makes a lot of sense.", "So then finally before I hand the call back to Victor, one other quick note on the acceleration of our bispecific conjugate, the KSI-501 program.", "As you may remember, KSI-501 inhibits both IL-6, interleukin 6 as well as VEGF. And IL-6 blockade is being explored as a novel therapeutic strategy in patients with severe and critical COVID-19 disease.", "Now, VEGF is also a potent inducer of vascular permeability and edema which may play a pathological role in COVID-19 driven lung dysfunction.", "So OG2072 which is the bispecific fusion protein that we use to build our ophthalmology product candidate KSI-501 binds with high affinity to both of its targets simultaneously, both IL-6 and VEGF, and it shows some quite interesting synergistic inhibition of those mechanisms in vitro.", "So, we are advancing by six months the GMP manufacturing for the OG2072 protein, which may enable an assessment of systemically administered OG2072 in patients with worsening COVID-19 disease.", "And ancillary benefits of our acceleration include the use of GMP material for the KSI-501 toxicology program and a more predictable IND submission and first-in-human timeline for the bioconjugate KSI-501 in 2021 in patients with retinal vascular disease featuring an inflammatory component.", "So now, back to Victor to wrap up our remarks and before we get into Q&A.", "Victor Perlroth -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Thanks, Jason. Yeah, I think it would be helpful if we reviewed our upgraded KSI-301 clinical plan in portfolio quickly as illustrated on slide 5.", "And this refined slide kind of brings together the upgraded program and as we work to finalize the study protocols across the program and including the number of subjects with each study have been powered really to 90% plus.", "So the slide 5 shows our current view of the clinical studies, their timelines for first patient in and last step patient in, the overall treatment duration and a rough view into top line data availability, and this, our program and strategy obviously feeds are in parallel 2022 BLA filing plan.", "So it's nice to see this refinement of our clinical plan which, the 1b ongoing the DAZZLE study continuing to enroll and our plans to initiate the paired DME and the RVO pivotals in September hopefully.", "And then the NPDR study, we'd like to bring it on board as much in parallel, but as Jason mentioned, it will depend a little bit on the clinical communities' guidance in terms of whether we're incredibly going to be able to bring those patients in during the pandemic and/or what's happening with the pandemic from Q4 into Q1 of next year.", "So moving into slide 6, what we call sort of the four pillars of retinal vascular disease, as we continue to finalize the pivotal study designs in the program we're of course guided by the Phase 1b study design and the data, which directly educate our Phase 3 pivotal study designs.", "So in addition to informing the design of the pivotal studies, the Phase 1b data we're generating is lending, we believe a very high degree of confidence in being able to hit the primary endpoint in these studies and to clearly differentiate KSI-301 on durability.", "So these pivotal programs, each study alone and even more powerful together can support a very highly differentiated target product profile what we increasingly call sort of the Generation 2.0 profile.", "Our real and obvious shifting of that treatment interval within each one of these diseases right -- further to the right with a clear white space between us and our comparator, EYLEA.", "So we're also thinking through the marketplace that we'll be entering in 2023. Given a highly differentiated profile, we're actively assessing also the manufacturing capacity desired to supply the first years of launch.", "This assessment includes the branded agents, but also assesses the upside opportunity for KSI-301 of capturing monthly Avastin patients and injections as well.", "So this slide 6 is a bit of an important summary that lets us look at each of these four indications for KSI, take a look at some of the data that's been generated from the 1b, that data helps us design and lock-in on the protocols in our pivotal program and lets us think a little bit about the target product profile that we may end up with in terms of non-inferiority of vision in the core pivotals as a primary endpoint and then that core differentiation on durability, which is meaningful within each one of these indications, and we believe lends a very high overall probability of success to the medicine in each one of the pivotals together into a very powerful profile, as we think about the complexity of the market that we'll be dropping into.", "Moving into slide 7, really the pieces of our efforts across our pipeline are captured well by this 2022 vision slide.", "The breadth of the indications we're evaluating in parallel of four KSI-301 really reaches a crux or an apex in 2022 with our plans for a single BLA to be filed for wet AMD, DME and RVO, and if we can get the NPDR studies going with the right level of enthusiasm in momentum potentially DR as well.", "So for KSI-501, we hope to benefit from this manufacturing acceleration that Jason mentioned which also increases our confidence to achieve an IND and first patient in in 2021, and we're thinking about a combined sort of Phase 1a, 1b type study for KSI-501, because that's worked quite well obviously for the KSI-301 in terms of evaluation of safety, but also utility of the molecules.", "And lastly, we're seeing a very interesting progress internally with our new triplet inhibitors, in this case, KSI-601 which we're bringing together initially for dry AMD", "and we're also looking forward toward submitting an IND for that program in 2022.", "Moving on to slide 8, we've achieved quite a lot in 2019. So, looking to 2020, we'll be excited to present additional data as we mentioned, from our Phase 1b that details the durability of the durability of KSI-301 and we expect to present data at the ASRS virtually or through as we mentioned a Kodiak hosted virtual event.", "So we're looking forward to July for that new data update. We continue or we will continue to execute on our DAZZLE study in wet AMD patients and move that execution also into Europe and ex-US.", "And we'll activate the full KSI-301 pivotal program in the additional indications.", "In 2021, we'll continue to report data from our Phase 1b study and execute on our clinical operations with the potential DAZZLE pivotal study readout.", "Furthermore, we will seek to advance KSI-501 into the clinic. 2022 obviously is a massive year for the Company as we detailed in the prior slide.", "Our vision is to report multiple pivotal study top line readouts in 2022 and submit that single BLA in the big indications.", "In 2023 then, we're planning for regulatory approvals and commercialization of KSI-301 in key geographies.", "So in summary, we're very pleased with the business highlights for the first quarter and first part of the second quarter of 2020.", "We believe we are well positioned and we're looking forward to accomplishing our goals for the remainder of the calendar year 2020.", "We'll now open the floor to analysts for questions. Operator?", "Yes, sir. [Operator Instructions] And our first question will come from Anupam Rama with JPMorgan.", "Hey guys, thanks for taking the question. This is Matt [Phonetic] on for Anupam. So first off well done with being so agile around 301 development to be efficient and keep timelines for the vision intact as much as possible.", "So good job there. I guess one thing we've been trying to think about is a little more forward looking and relate to competition from additional biosimilars across indications.", "And what these retinal markets might look like when 301 potentially launches. So if you could just comment on how you expect market dynamics to play out, that would be really helpful.", "Victor Perlroth -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Well, Anupam, I think we are focused right now on the acceleration in the clinical execution and making sure that we have the right pivotal study program, right, that the design to those pivotal studies, both are educated from the Phase 1b, so we can have a very high probability of success in those studies, which we think we will, and also that the endpoints in the durability that we'll be able to show are really going to be meaningful.", "And I think what I mentioned is we like to think of it as this Generation 2.0 profile, which is we're going to be shifting that distribution with non-inferior efficacy and safety, but shifting the dosing interval, that distribution substantially to the right in each one of these indications versus say EYLEA.", "And I think what's really special about the data that we're showing and I think predicated on the underlying design of the molecule, right, is really having a lot of white space between us and EYLEA.", "So, we think that's really important to be really differentiated and not coming out as incremental. If we can do that, we believe first of all being a very strong position, right.", "What's the complexity of the market, like in the 2023, 2024, 2025 timeframe? We believe, as we've mentioned that biosimilars will be important for the branded agents.", "So Lucentis biosimilars will eat Lucentis share and EYLEA biosimilars whenever they come out, exactly, for example, in the US market will likely eat EYLEA share to some degree.", "We're getting smarter I would say on some of this, I believe, in a way the retina marketplace is like a spec pharma with high concentration.", "We believe that KSI as a branded molecule. There are a lot of incentives that will drive the physicians for sure, but maybe even payers to support KSI ASP plus 6 for example, and we don't see a lot of incentives, for say, leading players like Regeneron to really compete say with biosimilars on price.", "And of course biosimilars in retina are going to have to be more cautious and take things to a higher level of excellence in terms of manufacturing consistency.", "So those are a lot of words. I think the key is that we even believe there is the possibility for us to be able to eat Avastin's share if we really bring a molecule like KSI with this important target product profile benefit and differentiation.", "And then vis-a-vis Lucentis and EYLEA, we think there'll be an incentive to go with an attractively priced KSI-301 molecule for retina docs who can bring a better molecule for their patients and perhaps make more money with our branded molecule.", "So we think we're going to get smarter as we continue to build this kind of pre-commercial kind of capability and knowledge and investment for Kodiak, but we think for right now, we're making all of the right decisions in terms of our pivotal study protocols and designs such that when we come through this program with all of these indications in parallel and fall into the market that we're doing it in a very thoughtful manner that we can compete and access branded share.", "And a key component of all of this as well, what percent of the branded market do we think we should plan to capture from a manufacturing standpoint in years one, two and three?", "And I think we hope that's going to be a big number, and so we're working from a manufacturing standpoint to be able to service that.", "Great. Thank you very much, guys. Thanks for taking the question.", "Thank you. Our next question will come from Michael Yee with Jefferies.", "Hey, guys. Thanks for the update. Thanks, Victor. Two questions. One is, you commented on enrollment in the press release", "and I thought this was pretty important given it's kind of a gating factor to getting data. Can you just comment about what gives you confidence in the timing for completion of enrollment this year in AMD?", "What are you seeing in April and May, the shape of the curve and what gives you that confidence to talk about these timelines, that would be helpful.", "And then second question is contingent on those timelines that you've laid out, I think we're all very excited for the data for AMD in 2021, potentially, but is there any chance given all the things that have gone on or shifted that there is a chance you would look back at that potential interim analysis that's built in and say, hey, what are the factors that we could look at this and don't have to wait until 2021?", "Maybe just talk about that and whether that's totally off the table, that's something that's still technically possible.", "Victor Perlroth -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Right. Yeah. Hey, thanks. Thanks, Michael. I think on the wet AMD timeline, we were enrolling 50 to 60 patients a month in February and March.", "We have close to 50 sites activated in the United States. Our objective is to have another 50 sites by and large activated globally right for a total of say 100 sites across the program.", "We -- even through, let's say, end of March and April, enrollments were say 25 plus patients a month and we expect that to increase certainly through the end of this year.", "We're not going to fall on the sword over finalizing enrollment in DAZZLE this year. I think if you look at what we've put as we kind of put potential.", "And the reason isn't that we could not -- we could actually jam the enrollment through, I believe we've done in a thoughtful and safe manner.", "It's just -- we also want to be thoughtful about what percent of patients in our pivotal program do we want ex-US, because in wet AMD and DME, we could rapidly enroll those studies completely in the United States, but we don't want to do that and we have to make a determination, is it going to be 15%, 20% or 25% of these patients in these studies that we want to have from the ex-US sites.", "And so given slightly more complex dynamics in Europe, we're going to be monitoring that fairly carefully.", "And so in the end, we may hold the studies open in terms of last patient in a little bit longer to bring up the ex-US component.", "So that could drive top line data for say DAZZLE further into I guess that would be like early 2022. And then that sort of means that this whole pivotal program would sort of be converging in terms of top line data coming out of multiple studies with very quick succession.", "We don't see that really, really as a negative. So, OK, how does that impact our view of looking at an interim kind of data analysis?", "I think with the current -- we were surprised, pleasantly, I think that physicians continued -- wanted to continue to enroll patients in our studies, let's say, in March and April and that we were able to successfully do so.", "So, and we see things opening up a little bit and, with enrollment shifting and up our desire to begin enrolling in recruiting randomizing patients in Europe starting almost immediately, I think.", "So things look up, I mean, if things were to take a very nasty tumble in terms of COVID-19, right, and enrollments went to even worse than they were in March and April, then I think we could revisit the idea of some sort of interim, because we're close to 250 patients enrolled.", "So at a one-to-one randomization of like a 125 patients per group, that begins to be sort of interesting.", "But I think, we don't see that today that things are getting worse. We think overall it's opening up a bit for us that we should see enrollment rates go north -- certainly north of where we are today of 25 to 30.", "And as we activate ex-US, I don't know exactly what monthly number we'll get to. So I think as long as things continue to have a reasonably upward trajectory, right, the concept of like we're very well capitalized now, and we don't need the interim as a financing catalyst and rather, we're really focused on running these studies in parallel and driving toward that top line data.", "And we think that will be really powerful. And I think we want people to focus on, look, what do people think is the probability of success of our molecule based on the Phase 1b data, right, of hitting the endpoint in terms of non-inferiority of efficacy and vision, right, and with a fundamentally differentiated durability.", "Why do people think that PTRS [Phonetic] is for our molecule in these studies? And how do people think about the receptivity, right, of clinicians and the marketplace to our molecule?", "And I think the answer hopefully is that we have a very high PTRS unless we get hit by a bus. And if that's the case, I think maybe you want to get in early as a shareholder, because there is not a lot of free float available, we're tightly held to a large degree and we are very pleased with the ownership that's really concentrated with a lot of long-only funds as well as our early owners.", "So if you're excited about Kodiak and our profile, you want to be excited early because otherwise you're going to pay up later, if we're lucky.", "All right. Thank you. Our next question will come from Matthew Harrison with Morgan Stanley.", "Hi. Thank you. This is Max Skor on for Matthew Harrison. Can you comment at all about the -- regarding the redosing criteria for the Phase 3 trials will be different than the Phase 1b trial and anyway could it alter the POS?", "Victor Perlroth -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Sure. Jason, you want to handle that maybe across the portfolio of studies?", "Jason Ehrlich -- Chief Medical Officer and Chief Development Officer", "Yeah, sure. Thanks. So call for DAZZLE, we tightened up the criteria a little bit between the Phase 1b and DAZZLE.", "And again, thinking about what's the different purposes of those studies, right, the Phase 1b is an exploratory study to help us understand how the medicine is performing in the clinic in these different diseases and whereas of course the pivotal study at the end of the day is a non-inferiority study against an active comparator, right.", "So, and in DAZZLE, whereas in the Phase 1b, the criteria are for determining when somebody should be retreated, in DAZZLE, and if I get you in DME say, the criteria are more for regrouping, right, for, in DAZZLE, is the patient on 12, 16 or 20-week dosing on a going forward basis, right, not whether or not they get retreated.", "So the purpose of the criteria is also a little bit different.", "Now that being said, right, as we presented at Angiogenesis, if you overlay the DAZZLE criteria on top of the wet AMD patients in the Phase 1b actually, it looks quite favorable right with the time to first meeting of those DAZZLE regrouping criteria was at that time in that cohort like 12.5% of them would have met those criteria at about 12 weeks, 12.5% at 16 weeks, and everybody else like 75% of the patients at five months or 20 weeks.", "So that was -- that's quite exciting and reassuring.", "So as you look then to the DME study, we haven't disclosed the specific criteria yet, but I think the idea is -- the study design fundamentally is similar to DAZZLE where EYLEA is on a fixed regimen and the KSI regimen will be able to float in this case between two months to six months, right.", "So we will tighten and keep those criteria a little bit tighter most likely, right. Again for the same reason that you need to have the right balance of durability versus making sure that you meet your non-inferiority comparison in vision.", "So -- and we think that the DME data are very supportive of the regrouping criteria that we'll be using.", "And then in RVO, right, in the first six months, which is for the primary endpoint, EYLEA is monthly and the KSI-301 will be every eight weeks fixed interval dosing after the couple of loading doses.", "So there is not really the same criteria in that first six months.", "All right. Thank you. Our next question will come from John McNeil with Goldman Sachs.", "Hi guys. I'm actually dialing in on behalf of Graig Suvannavejh. Just a quick one from us. How sustainable do you think that $6 million monthly burn rate is?", "And how could that maybe evolve over the course of the year?", "Victor Perlroth -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Yeah, I think the rationale for sort of mentioning that I think was more like, well, if COVID were to get substantially worse and things moved more into like a hibernation phase, what's attractive about Kodiak is with the 1b study and DAZZLE, and broader efforts in the labs and stuff like that, we don't have a very high like organic kind of burn rate.", "So we can hibernate running our existing studies for a very long time.", "As we -- but the pandemic and its impact, we're seeing, we're going to continue to have the ability to grow and accelerate increase in momentum right with our plan the 2022 vision as we kind of mentioned.", "So I mean that burn rate will grow substantially right as we initiate the new set of pivotals, the gearing up, the ramping up over the summer and the initiation of those studies targeting September.", "So it will ramp up substantially, and then of course in the background, we have manufacturing-related efforts, which as I mentioned, there are number of choices there as we think about what level of how many millions of dosage forms do we think we want to be able to service to provide the market, right into 2023, 2024 and 2025 and as we do the validation work right at scale for our BLA.", "So when John talks about, well, how far is our existing say $430 million going to go? I think we provide guidance definitively into 2022, how far into 2022 really depends on the rate of enrollment, which I think as we articulate on that one clinical timelines slide.", "We do expect fairly aggressive and appropriate I think enrollment and that drives a lot of costs and then as I said in the background a lot of the BLA-related manufacturing components.", "I think at this stage, right, our pipeline, which is we are definitely focusing on as part of the broader remit as our retina high science company, KSI-501 will begin to have increased costs.", "And then in the background eventually our triplets. But as you know, the majority of our burn rate is going to be driven by the, say, 2000 plus patients in our pivotal program for KSI-301 and then in the proper manufacturing, scale-up and validation activities for that manufacturing component of the BLA.", "So that's sort of more of a backwards looking thing and the burn rate will increase substantially. But that will be in context of appropriate execution.", "It's just not like we're sitting on top of a massive burn rate and it's all going to be driven by moving toward the objective of the 2022 vision.", "Okay, thank you. And if I could maybe get one more. How do you think about, I know you talked about enrollment a lot, but if enrollment rates did sort of surprise even further to the downside.", "Would you think at all about looking to accrue treatment experienced patients and maybe kind of related to that, how do you think about how going to market potentially only data and treatment-naive patients might impact sort of initial uptake?", "Victor Perlroth -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Right. I think we feel really comfortable with going following the framework of the anti-VEGF biologics of by and large going into treatment-naive patients.", "We like the predictability right of being able to extrapolate from the Phase 1b situation into our pivotal designs.", "I think we feel very comfortable that we can get enough treatment-naive wet AMD patients and we feel very comfortable that we can get enough treatment-naive DME patients, where I think a premier anti-VEGF biologic as a branded agent such that we find them anyway, the community of retina specialists is excited to participate in our studies, we believe to help bring those treatment-naive patients into our studies.", "For RVO, it's not as though clinicians are less excited about our agent in RVO. It's just that the overall prevalence of RVO is lower and so we were thinking we are going to have to go to more countries.", "But I think by shifting the plan or upgrading it as we say to one RVO study and perhaps BRVO has higher prevalence then overall CRVO.", "So we think the new design has a number of like predictability and efficiency. So we think we're going to get there with the treatment-naive patients.", "I think, do we think it may be useful to run -- generate some data right in a quote-unquote, pivotal context using a treatment experienced patients?", "I think the answer is that, we have had some discussions along that line. I mean, Jason, you may want to provide a little bit of commentary.", "I don't think it would hurt from a commercial standpoint, if we did not have that. Having said that, it could make sense to the extent that we might want to have a fuller label, right, because to the extent that, say for example in DME, we're going beyond six months in patients in terms of requiring retreatment in the 1b.", "Having said that, we've taken our pivotal study and we're actually allowing some patients if they need to drop to eight weeks, that's not because we think that's fundamentally required from the standpoint of the medicines, but we want to have a broader label so that physicians can get reimbursement and can use KSI across all patients.", "And in wet AMD where we have the Q12 as the minimum, we do believe it could make sense to have some treatment experience, let's say Q4 weeks in Q8 weeks and not to wait till after the BLA or after approval to run those studies and doing those credibly in treatment experienced patients could be a way to generate some of that data to get that broader label.", "And you may remember that in year two of DAZZLE right in the wet AMD pivotal we're actually rerandomizing the EYLEA patients, one-to-one.", "So half of those people will go on Q8 week KSI, such that we can begin to generate, and in a way, that is sort of a defined treatment experienced population.", "So we're doing it in a variety of different ways that I think are thoughtful and that will our -- we're keeping our kind of our eye on what we need from a label in the market and a commercial standpoint.", "Jason, do you have any quick comment on that good question?", "Jason Ehrlich -- Chief Medical Officer and Chief Development Officer", "Yeah. Victor, I think you covered really nicely. I guess the only thing I would say additionally, is yeah,", "I think that those data like, well, what happens when you switch a patient from one therapy to another, were useful at the time of EYLEA launch, but then I think people also realized that those data in and of themselves at least the way a lot of those studies were done can be hard to interpret, right, which is why we kind of like the part of our DAZZLE study where we take naive patients, treat them for a year with EYLEA and then switch half of them and see what happens when you switch half of them, and continue the rest on EYLEA.", "That's a better experimental design for getting an answer to a question.", "I think for market access, I don't think it's critical or probably actually even important fundamentally to have data on treatment experienced patients, because from a commercial market access perspective, that's not typically something that's required.", "I think that people may switch patients when they start using a new therapy, they may start with switching patients rather than new patients until they get comfortable, but a lot of our retina physicians will already have comfort with KSI-301 from participating clinical trials.", "But to Victor's point, ultimately those data can and will be generated. So it's always a question from what's the best timing and way to do it in a way that is, it gives you credible clinical answers to important clinical questions.", "Thank you. Our next question comes from Robyn with SunTrust.", "Robyn Karnauskas -- SunTrust Robinson Humphrey -- Analyst", "Hi, guys, thanks for taking my question. I guess I want to ask about biosimilars all the time, but I was just thinking given Beovu, and by the way my two daughters are going to make an appearance on this call for guarantee, I promise you, but thinking about like the fears that people talk about Beovu [Phonetic] investment side, or maybe concerns -- tell us mainly about inflammation how when you're thinking about developing your clinical trial plan did you think about maybe alleviating those concerns in a clinical trial setting versus having people saying, well, I'm kind of nervous in the real world and like to see some more events, and did that -- how have you factored that in?", "Or what kind of trials would you do to help people do that? Do you think it's even needed?", "And then is -- three questions. Am I clear that your bispecific drug, it sounds like it could be -- when could it really go into patients, and are you hitting as much -- are you absorbing as much IL-6 is like an average IL-6 drug alone.", "Do you have a sense of that? And third is probably early stated [Phonetic] question. But just -- so it sounds like you could actually apply I think your BLA, would you do all three of these indications, RVO, DME and AMD all at the same time in a BLA, is that possible?", "Victor Perlroth -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Sure. Hey, Robyn. So I think your first question is a little bit around, well, is there a new safety environment for new anti-VEGFs because of what's happened to Beovu, I think an important consideration there is whether what happened with Beovu is like a surprise right and that only when it went into like a large commercial population, right, did people begin to see some tail event, OK, which I don't think is really accurate.", "I think if you look back, right, reports of this kind of retinal artery occlusion, right, or inflammatory blindness really goes back to the beginning of the molecule, right, you can look back at some of those FDA databases back to 2015 under Alcon right under the short list of a couple of different severe adverse events, you'll find reports of retinal artery occlusion.", "So I think it was always present at a useful yet low percent into, right, maybe you could argue or quibble right with Novartis, is it 0.1%, but more seemingly in the label, it's closer to 1% etc.", "So I think given that, and then you begin to say, well, is it manufacturing, right? Or is it the actual molecule?", "And I think even recently, right, some of the new Novartis announcement suggests that they've looked at manufacturing and they don't think that's the cause.", "They haven't found any correlation with manufacturing. I think you begin to look more at the molecule itself, right, and then you begin to look at more some complexities around the biology of that molecule, right, very high pre-existing ADA, very high treatment-emergent ADA and lower visual acuity benefits for patients that have ADA.", "All of these things are unusual for anti-VEGF biologics. It turns out, as the European regulators put, right, as we've discussed, Robyn, in their assessment that this type of biology, right, high pre-existing ADA, high treatment-emergent has also been seen for other sort of quote unquote, non-natural antibody fragment platforms right like diabodies and camelids [Phonetic].", "So maybe there is some whether its innate immune or I don't really know, right, I don't think anybody understands to date, but a complex biology that accidentally happens to be here with this Beovu format.", "So, we don't have that obviously with the KSI-301. We're fully antibody. We haven't had any pre-existing ADA in terms of what we've measured to date and appear to have very low or what we may call spurious treatment-emergent ADA with our molecule and with the current clinical experience that we have which is north of 100 patient years now across the 1b and DAZZLE, haven't seen any signs of like a similar problem that people see with Beovu.", "Now, of course, people will worry, and the question is, well, when do you feel that enough data has been generated so we have some confidence that there is not a tail safety event?", "And I think there is not really an easy answer to that, right. I mean we do monthly or more assessments across all of our pivotals, don't forget we were running the pivotal program with all of the indications in parallel, right, rather than running one indication in series, right, and then the next, and then the next.", "So we're trying to generate as much of this data, both from a safety, efficacy and durability standpoint as quickly as possible and we're trying to be as transparent as we can with running this 1b study and presenting the data as we can.", "So I don't think there is any special secrets. But I think fundamentally we're not suffering a lot of the same baggage in terms of design and complexity of underlying biology and we have a good amount of clinical data available and we're not seeing this complex pattern that they had.", "In terms of the IL-6 VEGF, we call that our OG2072 protein, right. It's the protein component of our bioconjugate.", "So it could be evaluated systemically. And as a systemic agent, which would be given in an acute manner, right, say in COVID-19 patients, you can give whatever dose level you want.", "I think if you look at the Regeneron or you look at the Actemra, the Roche molecule, they have different dose levels in terms of mgs per kg.", "But from a systemic standpoint, you can get quite large doses. So we think we can get very strong anti-IL 6 in this case as a ligand, and also very strong anti-VEGF at whatever dose levels required.", "And also as I think we mentioned intriguingly we've seen some very interesting synergy across both of those biologies and so perhaps the molecule could be important.", "And so we want to make the molecule available, and at the same time, we get those ancillary benefits of some real manufacturing acceleration of the program, because the core critical path for the IND and first-in-human really was GMP manufacturing of the antibody.", "So that's a core feature of the KSI-501 acceleration. And then in terms of putting all three of the big indications into a single BLA, Jason, maybe you could talk a little bit about that regulatory strategy.", "Jason Ehrlich -- Chief Medical Officer and Chief Development Officer", "Yeah, sure. Thanks, Victor and thanks, Robyn. Yeah, so I think that that's I think quite a reasonable approach particularly or at least in the United States, right.", "The more -- of course from the agency's perspective, the more information that you have, the better on your medicine and you need to submit the safety data, all of the safety data that you have right at the time even if it's across multiple indications.", "So I think the idea of submitting it in one package where they can really understand the total safety database as well as the efficacy across the different indications, I think that's a quite nice strategy.", "Victor Perlroth -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "I mean even beyond that, I mean, Jason, I would say, we have in [Phonetic] writing from FDA that they would look forward basically to receive, I mean certainly like the wet AMD and the DME they expect us to submit those together.", "Jason Ehrlich -- Chief Medical Officer and Chief Development Officer", "Victor Perlroth -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Together is something that they. I think they appreciate because it allows them to make higher quality decisions, I guess.", "Robyn Karnauskas -- SunTrust Robinson Humphrey -- Analyst", "Well, thank you. Thank you for all that color. Thank you.", "Victor Perlroth -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "All right. Thank you. Our next question comes from Gena Wang with Barclays.", "Thank you for taking my questions. I have three questions. The first one also follow the single BLA filing.", "I understand you talk to is FDA, just wondering was that one wet AMD trial, two DME trials and a one RVO trials, was that agreed upon with the FDA and what is the EMA feedback?", "And my second question is regarding the RVO study, what will be your thoughts on the patient breakdown between BRVO and CRVO?", "My third question is regarding the 5% -- less than 5% missed visits, just wondering how do you collect the data afterwards?", "And then how do you analyze the data and how would that impact the clinical endpoint data?", "Victor Perlroth -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Right. Okay. Just to summarize the questions, Jason, maybe you want to hit them. I think the first is what do we have from FDA specifically in terms of our kind of what we call the upgraded KSI-301 pivotal plan, right, so where are we in terms of the FDA on that.", "The second being the expected breakdown within the single RVO pivotal for BRVO and CRVO. And third, when we do have missed visits, how important is that to the integrity of the study and what are we basically doing to prevent them and if they happen, is it important or material to the study?", "Jason Ehrlich -- Chief Medical Officer and Chief Development Officer", "Right. Yes. So I think with regards to the FDA question, Gena, yeah, I think we're quite comfortable with where we are in terms of regulatory feedback both what's in the written feedback as well as subsequent conversations.", "The RVO in the context of a single study, we would stratify the randomization between the two different RVO sort of subtypes of the branch vein and the central vein, and if it's branch vein, it's more common, we probably have a minimum sort of cap if you will, on the number of CRVO patients to make sure that that category of patients is adequately represented.", "I mean in the community. It's probably like branch vein is maybe like 3.5 times to 4.5 times more common than central veins, really depending on where you are.", "So probably like a 20%-ish minimum on a central vein patients makes sense to make sure that they are well represented in the study.", "In terms of the missed visits, and how does that impact of data? I'd say, I mean, at a high level. provided that it's really one missed visit say for a patient or scatter shot over time as opposed to like a series of missed visits in a row or many missed visits in a row, then I think those data are just handled by the statistical methods as they routinely are, right.", "I mean there's always missing data in every study and the study is also adequately powered for assuming a certain rate of discontinuations from the study and our rate of discontinuations as opposed to missing data is also very low.", "So I mean, most of modern statistical methods will basically have different methods for imputing missing data in a study.", "So it's really then a question of, if a patient were to miss like multiple visits in a row, how do you handle those particular data?", "And the protocol also specifies considerations for when a patient should continue if they missed a certain number of missed visits, but fundamentally with missed visits at the rate that they are, I think that the study will absorb those without any meaningful impact and they are distributed fundamentally, they should be distributed equally across both groups.", "But I don't think that should really be an important source of bias.", "Victor Perlroth -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Right. I think even when we look in more detail, right, at the design of the DAZZLE pivotal and as we think about educating ourselves as we finalize right on the margin, the designs for the new pivotals, I think we believe we can withstand a substantially higher missed visit rate.", "I don't know what number we would give, but is it 20% or more than that or whatever and still have a very good studies that would get us to the right outcomes.", "Okay, very helpful. Just wanted to follow-up regarding the BLA filing or the pivotal study program design.", "Victor Perlroth -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Jason Ehrlich -- Chief Medical Officer and Chief Development Officer", "Yeah, I'd say EMA in terms of like how many indications you can file at once, I think there were ultimately have to be some more conversations with them.", "Some of it depends on sort of national opinions versus EMA scientific advice. So I think that those are topics that like how many of these indications can you get in the initial license versus the subsequent variation will need some more discussion with EMA ultimately.", "Victor Perlroth -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Right. I mean, one thing I think that's interesting. Gena, as you know, looking at what's been the response in say the United Kingdom in context of COVID-19 for retina whereas in the United States although visits have gone down, as Jason mentioned from the Western data, right, the proportion of visits, where there have been anti-VEGF injections has increased and physicians of course are still seeing new treatment-naive patients, but in the UK, the guidance has been for treatment-naive patients right basically it's not to see the patient.", "It's basically to I think, Jason, wasn't the feedback or the new guidance to specifically basically come back in four months.", "So, there is an important alignment of the target product profile of the differentiation of KSI-301 for Europe and I think one of the things to do is I mean of course we're going to be running our pivotal studies in Europe.", "But also to maybe look for like unique opportunities right where this new profile for our medicine is a nice fit for example in the UK, because it's just not reasonable to leave patients with these diseases for four months without therapy.", "Thank you. Our next question will come from Matthew Luchini with BMO Capital Markets.", "Hi, good afternoon. Thanks for taking the questions. So a couple from me. I guess, first, with regard to the revised DME, RVO study timelines.", "Beyond sort of the broader COVID environment, are there any other factors that could impact the start of those trials from the new September-October timeframe that you're putting forward?", "And then secondly, just you touched on it, I think in the last question, but I just wanted to make it explicit, with a single RVO study, the plan is to still get a broad RVO label as opposed to something indication specifically either BRVO or CRVO.", "And then lastly, I wanted to just come back to manufacturing since it's come up a couple of times. And if you could just remind us a little bit about where you are today versus what we think you need for the revised pivotal program and then ultimately where you hope to be over the next, let's say 12 months to 18 months as these studies are starting to read out?", "Victor Perlroth -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Right. I mean I think based on the information that we have today and the decisions that we're making, and I think as you mentioned, independent of COVID-19, I mean I think we're feeling very comfortable about September/October first-in-human for the new program.", "So that's really what we're targeting and it's going to be nice because we're able to follow the DAZZLE framework that we've put in, right, say for example in the United States into the same sites and a lot of the pieces of these studies, for example, as Jason mentioned, the DME study, has a very similar design to the DAZZLE study.", "So a lot of the pieces of these new paired DME studies is going to come directly from DAZZLE into these same sites and we're going to drop RVO into the same sites as well.", "And then we're ahead in terms of site activation right for DAZZLE in Europe and then we're going to flow these other studies directly into the same sites.", "So there is we have CTAs approved in many countries in Europe and we're basically ready to go there. So we feel good there.", "And those are really just based on conservatism right in terms of all what's happening with COVID and do we want to -- should we cross the transom of activating all these additional studies in June, that didn't seem wise but targeting September seems quite good.", "In terms of RVO, we believe that you know, as Jason mentioned, we'll have both coverage for BRVO and CRVO in the pivotal and we believe we're in good shape there.", "I think on the manufacturing, there's obviously a lot of attention on clinical from the standpoint of these types of discussions, right, if you don't have your manufactured material when you hit the market, you're not going to be in good shape.", "We don't want to be in a situation of generating really exciting pivotal data and then asking all of you to wait many years before we're really able to service the market.", "So, we're spending a good amount of time. I think the fact that we've had such a wonderful safety profile to-date is a testament to the quality and attention that we put into manufacturing and have for a number of years.", "If you remember with Lucentis when it entered to the market, right, it had as much as 15% inflammation and then they were able to clean up that formulation from their lyophilized into their liquid and now into their pre-filled syringe and really brought that down.", "We're trying and want to launch in a prefilled syringe. And so we're working hard to make that a possibility, currently, we're at 1,000 liter scale and we're shifting that into the 6,000 liter to 10,000 liter range for launch.", "So there is some process development and tech transfer work that's in process. But fundamentally, it's the same master cell bank and that overall method will be very similar as we scale to where we want to be commercially and the conjugation that we do to make our bioconjugate uses industry standard ADC type conjugation methods.", "And so we don't anticipate any technical core technical challenges there rather again, it's more scale up in to say larger facilities.", "So there is a lot of work there. That's a great question. I think part of it is we can ask you and the community, well, what percent of the branded market, do you think in years one, two and three post launch Kodiak should be investing?", "What percent of that branded market in terms of millions of doses? For example, I think last year there were say 25 million intravitreal injections that were given globally and if half of those were Avastin, right, that's 12.5 million, and let's say, it's growing at say 6% to 10% a year, right, so what percent of that market, right, in year one, two and three can KSI 301-credibly grab?", "And that helps to drive our view of manufacturing, scale-up. So it's quite an interesting conversation and we're trying to do it in the context of prefilled syringe as well.", "So a lot of activities and maybe that will become more important over the next couple of years. We have a tremendous amount of drug substance of bioconjugate that we manufacture.", "Then, we did a very successful resupply over the last 12 months. So we're very good in terms of bioconjugate drug supply to service the pivotal program.", "So really our attention is toward the scale up in the validation toward the BLA activities.", "Thank you. Our next question will come from Zegbeh Jallah with ROTH Capital.", "I just had a quick question with regards to your expectations in terms of the longer-term data from the amended Phase 1b study.", "What are you hoping to see from that data or what are you hoping that investors would focus on in that next set of data and any learnings from that that you could apply to your pivotal?", "And then, just another follow-up question, just out of curiosity here, how did you come up with the idea for OG2072 for COVID-related diseases?", "And then can you elaborate on any of the synergies in between that program and KSI-501?", "Victor Perlroth -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Yeah, so just want in terms of expectations for the amended Phase 1b study, the longer-term data.", "Victor Perlroth -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "All right. Well, I think our core focus this year is on what we call it kind of the durability of the durability.", "Right. So, the early phase 1b we're sort of through the loading phase and then coming out of the loading phase or is a bit that time to that first retreatment across the three diseases and now we're sort of looking at the durability of that durability and when people who've got retreated, I'd say, four months to get retreated at four, six or two months kind of thing, and how that looks across the population of patients.", "So we think right now, that's a really interesting focus and that's where we should be exploring.", "We're of course extending the study as you realize out to say three years and why are we doing that? Well, first of all, we think it's really a nice way to follow and see the individual patient detail of the patients and the medicine over time and also of course it helps to extend like kind of the safety database that we want to have and a little bit of that safety experience.", "So that's really the rationale and then to be following them in the background and hopefully publishing on that and learning more and providing quite a lot of transparency in terms of how this medicine and anti-VEGF biologics work in a population that we track very carefully.", "And of course, we're trying to encourage as many of the patients to stay in the study through the three-year period to maximize the utility of the data generated.", "And I think that's really helpful, I suppose, in terms of physicians comfort with the level of safety to want to continue to treat these patients within longer term?", "Victor Perlroth -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Yeah, yeah. And then in terms of like to OG2072 the bispecific protein like I mentioned, there is a lot of ancillary benefits to the overall KSI-501 program.", "But I think the context of the synergy of some of this kind of activity of these two mechanisms is maybe a little bit surprising, the anti-IL6 and the anti-VEGF, certainly anti-IL6 right in COVID-19 for like the cytokine release syndrome component, but I think maybe what we see from some of their more recent Regeneron data is that there are other mechanisms of actions or like pathology that's kind of happening maybe in parallel, right.", "And I think some of these ideas that the vascular permeability that's either caused directly by the virus in the tissues or is it related to like the cytokine release, you get this vascular permeability in the tissues and you get that edema well, don't forget that anti-VEGF.", "It's really, maybe not an anti-angiogenic agent in terms of how it works in the eye, right, it's an anti-permeability agent and it really functions on vascular permeability.", "So if that's important in this disease, you can kind of get the anti-IL6 piece and this anti-permeability piece with a molecule that's showing synergy and that's quite potent.", "And so we're going to do a drug product run of our antibody as it release drug substance which is how we manufacture it in anyway and look to try and make that available in some of these basket clinical studies while we of course continue on our core mission in retina and ophthalmology.", "Victor Perlroth -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "All right, thank you. [Operator Instructions] All right speakers, and at this time, there are no further questions in the queue.", "Victor Perlroth -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Well, thanks, everybody for participating and hopefully gives you a very up-to-date view of Kodiak and the activities for the remainder of this year.", "John Borgeson -- Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Victor Perlroth -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Jason Ehrlich -- Chief Medical Officer and Chief Development Officer", "Robyn Karnauskas -- SunTrust Robinson Humphrey -- Analyst"]}

lowering drug prices.", "One of Trump’s proposals from his so-called presidential blueprint52 included eliminating some rebates paid by drug companies53 that hide the true cost of drugs.", "However, the Congressional Budget Office estimated that the measure would actually increase federal spending on Medicare and Medicaid by $177 billion.54 The Trump administration also announced a regulation that would require TV ads for drugs to include the list price.55 Some experts believe this policy will be ineffective56 at making pharmaceutical companies lower list prices or end price hikes for drugs and will only confuse or mislead consumers rather than help them.57 These half-measures, combined with Trump surrounding himself with high-level Big Pharma officials, clearly communicates that the administration is not on track to lower drug costs for Americans.", "Congress has done little to address the problem of high drug prices. Instead, many members continue to enjoy cozy relationships with the pharmaceutical industry.", "The industry spent more than $62 million in the 2016 congressional elections—the most it has ever spent on political campaigns.58 The massive influx of campaign cash benefited members of both parties, including those that sit on committees with jurisdiction over drug pricing.59 Big Pharma’s investment has paid off as recently as July 2019, when the Senate Finance Committee failed to pass an amendment on the Prescription Drug Pricing Reduction Act of 2019, which would have allowed Medicare to negotiate drug prices with manufacturers.60 Medicare’s ability to negotiate on drug prices, which is currently prohibited by law, “would provide the leverage needed to lower drug costs.”61", "Despite his promise to be tough on Big Pharma, President Trump has proven to be a friend to the industry.", "Big Pharma officials have filled at least 1662 current or former positions in the Trump administration, and many of Trump’s top health advisers have been industry insiders or close to the pharmaceutical companies.", "Trump’s first secretary of health and human services, former Rep. Tom Price (R-GA), was a longtime friend of the industry63 in Congress, where he not only pushed Big Pharma’s agenda but also benefited from it financially.64 Price, who drew scrutiny for more than $300,000 in health care stock trades, was eventually forced to resign in 201765 as a result of his illicit use of private jets on the taxpayers’ dime.", "In 2017, Trump nominated Joe Grogan66 to a top position at the U.S. Office of Management and Budget.

as recently as last October Allergan shares were trading for $190.", "While the deal left some questioning its strategic rationale, AbbVie’s chief executive, Rick Gonzalez, defended it on financial grounds.", "“Assets of the quality [of Allergan] are not always available, and certainly not at this price,” he told today’s analyst call.", "Indeed, Pfizer had been set to pay $160 billion for Allergan in 2015 until that acquisition was scuppered by a US clampdown on tax inversion deals.", "AbbVie is not planning to use the Allergan deal to domicile in Ireland.", "Some analysts speculated that AbbVie might spin off Allergan’s aesthetic business at some point in the future.", "If it manages to “unlock value” this way Allergan’s shareholders might be understandably aggrieved that the company did not go down this path itself, as had been mooted by Evercore ISI just last week.", "The announcement of the purchase of Allergan by AbbVie comes as a surprise, but is consistent with AbbVie’s intention to diversify away from their dependence on Humira, according to SVB Leerink Research analyst Geoffrey Porges.", "The transaction takes advantage of AbbVie’s dividend yield, discounted multiple and low borrowing cost, and significantly reduces their future dependence on their immunology franchise.", "With synergies, the combined company is likely to be able to maintain AbbVie’s impressive track record of dividend growth.", "Even modest efficiencies, which we expect to be extracted over time, should drive pro forma EPS growth above the pharmaceutical industry average, which should be attractive to some investors.", "This is yet another transaction driven by diversification, scale and low borrowing costs, rather than portfolio or top line synergies.", "Mr Porges expects AbbVie’s stock to trade poorly on this announcement, and then to be dependent on investors’ expectations for counter-offers or other risks to the transaction.", "The question for incremental investors is what the two companies have beyond these cornerstones, and the answer to that is unclear.", "Both companies have suffered from disappointing development outcomes outside their cornerstone franchises, and investors are unlikely to give them much credit for future innovation or R&D productivity.", "As such, he expects the future AbbVie to trade as an attractive financial asset, but not as an industry innovator and expect the combined company’s multiple to largely reflect the existing multiple of AbbVie.", "Adding his voice, Ned Pagliarulo on BioPharma Dive noted that For AbbVie, shareholders have grown increasingly focused on what will drive the company forward beyond Humira, which accounts for more than 60% of its revenues and faces entry of low-cost copycats in the U.S. in 2023.", "Buying Allergan is a response to those worries, although sell-side analysts were skeptical of how well Allergan and AbbVie's respective businesses fit together.", "Clinical setbacks, meanwhile, have fueled questions of Allergan's strategy outside of medical aesthetics.", "A takeover of Allergan by AbbVie would further reshuffle the top ranks of pharma following Takeda's $63 billion buyout of Shire and Bristol-Myers' pending deal for Celgene.", "Bristol-Myers Squibb is forced to wave goodbye to Otezla", "If Bristol-Myers Squibb was not facing enough investor disquiet over its $74 billion takeout of Celgene, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) piled on even more misery today by ordering Bristol to ditch the psoriasis drug Otezla as a condition of getting the deal across the finish line, commented Lisa Urquhart on Vantage, the editorial arm of the Evaluate group.", "This is undoubtedly a blow, as seen by the 7% fall in Bristol shares in early trading. Otezla, Celgene's third-biggest drug, was one of the things that had made the pricey looking deal vaguely palatable.", "This leaves Bristol with BMS-986165 as its brightest hope in psoriasis and other inflammatory disorders.", "BMS-986165 is one of the most advanced Tyk2 projects in development today and, while phase II trials have suggested that it could even be better than Otezla, having the approved blockbuster on the books as well would have been preferable to investors.", "Bristol tried to put positive spin on the news today, reconfirming that the merger was still on, but with a delay.", "Jonathan Gardner on BioPharma Dive added that Bristol-Myers already has in its stable Orencia, an injectable biological agent that treats psoriatic arthritis and had sales of $2.7 billion in 2018.", "Orencia is losing market exclusivity in 2021 and could be subject to biosimilar competition.", "The antitrust issues may not end there, however.

The impact of this pandemic on cancer will be long-lasting.", "With regard to research, delays in completing trials and the impact of that extension will play out over the next few years.", "I’m more confident about being able to recover from the delays in research than patients being able to get their cancer screenings on schedule, which is preventing a key to success in cancer care: early diagnosis and treatment.", "How has technology facilitated uninterrupted patient care during the COVID-19 pandemic? Will telemedicine become an integral part of cancer care in the future?", "How do you see the technology improving care for patients?", "The technology for patients who have access to it has been very, very effective. There were older patients and vulnerable patients with comorbid conditions who we were more comfortable being seen by video conferencing and telemedicine than in person.", "A picture is worth a thousand words, so seeing patients, even over a computer screen, can give us a sense of how well they are doing, and it was great to have that check in.", "Patients with breast cancer who were on oral therapies, on maintenance phases of treatment, or on later years of adjuvant therapy, for example, all did very well with telemedicine.", "It’s disappointing that we still have not seen the end of the pandemic, and we know patients are struggling with the ongoing crisis.", "However, telehealth has been very satisfying for many patients and it has decreased the volume of physical visits to the clinic.", "“In the clinic, we are already seeing an increasing number of women with more advanced breast cancer, as well as patients with advanced lung cancer.”", "It is imperative that telemedicine become a permanent way to take care of our patients without making them travel to the clinic as often as we did prior to the pandemic.", "I am hopeful we are going to have federal legislation that will support this technology across the country.", "Although telemedicine has been crucial in connecting patients with their physicians during the pandemic and was expected to help close the disparity gaps in care for patients in rural communities, an analysis by Komodo Health of telehealth utilization based on billing claims has found that patient use of telemedicine was directly correlated to higher levels of household income.2 Among the recommendations in the Road to Recovery Report is increasing access to and equity of cancer care by making expanded coverage for telemedicine permanent.", "However, many low-income patients do not have access to a computer, smartphone, or high-speed broadband.", "It is important that this report can help close the digital divide for these patients.", "We need to push for greater health equity for our patients. It has been readily apparent in our clinic that patients with a higher income and advanced education are more likely to have access to telemedicine.", "However, the broadband issue for people with low income is real and needs to be helped. ASCO can be part of the solution by advocating for all patients to have access to high-speed broadband and telemedicine.", "Among the positive consequences of the pandemic were changes to research procedures that benefited patients, including allowing patients to virtually consent to trials and receive study-related treatment at local facilities.", "How might a permanent change to clinical trial procedures lead to an increase in patient participation in cancer trials, especially among underrepresented patients, and improve study efficiency?", "It is a credit to the FDA and the National Cancer Institute that they relaxed regulations and procedures in clinical trial participation while prioritizing the safety of trial participants and researchers during the pandemic.", "ASCO was equally supportive of the plan to relax some clinical trial requirements. The phrase I used regarding cancer clinical trials was: “stay safe but stay the course.”", "I was misquoted in some media reports that I was advocating for broad eligibility requirements to be relaxed, and there was very little of that.", "I was talking about protocol deviations, including parameter coding deviations due to COVID-19, and allowing lab procedures to be done locally and monitoring patients via telehealth.", "This area is one in which underrepresented patients, elderly patients, patients living in rural communities, and single patients with young children could benefit from telehealth because some of the prepandemic regulations requiring patients to come to the trial site for follow-up visits probably are not necessary.", "I’ve always talked about the feasibility of relaxing some of the follow-up requirements after the first few cycles of treatment, when we know how well patients are tolerating the therapy.", "When possible, investigational oral drugs were shipped to patients’ homes instead of having them travel to the trial site; having their lab work done in local facilities near their home, and utilizing telehealth services for some clinical trial procedures were real satisfiers for our patients.", "All of that enabled more patients to participate in clinical trials who might otherwise have declined.", "Will these temporary changes be made permanent post-COVID?", "I’m hopeful some of these research changes will become permanent, and I think trial sponsors would be supportive as well.", "There is the right leadership at the FDA and the National Cancer Institute to implement these types of advances and make these pandemic-related changes permanent.", "We know that President Biden has a strong interest in cancer research, and I feel that, in 2021, we will be able to put some of these rule modifications into legislation that will be positive for everyone, especially patients.", "We simply need more patients to enroll in clinical trials to answer critical research questions and advance clinical care.", "Developing New Strategies to Combat Workforce Burnout", "How has the pandemic affected the oncology workforce and exacerbated physician burnout?", "The physical and emotional toll on our workforce has been substantial and is even more than I would have anticipated.", "Sometimes, with a crisis like this, there is some rallying around the problem. This pandemic, however, has been a drain on oncology providers, both at work and at home.", "There has been no escaping the stress.

It’s clear that the pandemic has accelerated provider burnout, forcing nurses out of the profession and some physicians into early retirement.", "The first encouragement I’ve seen since the pandemic began is the rollout of COVID-19 vaccines—a light at the end of the tunnel, so to speak.", "ASCO is also committed to -developing new strategies to help prevent workforce burnout in the future.", "Working Together to Ensure Access to High-Quality Cancer Care", "How will ASCO work with regulators, pharma, and the Biden administration to drive the implementation of the recommendations outlined in the Road to Recovery Report to improve access to high-quality cancer care for all patients?", "This report provides a roadmap of actions, both on the clinical trial and patient care side, that ASCO, Congress, the Biden administration, research sponsors, and other stakeholders can take to improve access to affordable and equitable cancer care and clinical research for patients.", "ASCO will continue to push forward these remedies, including safety nets for patients, such as Medicaid expansion as well as affordable and comprehensive insurance plans.", "We have to continue to work with legislators to make sure they understand the regulatory and financial burden on both patients and providers.", "With regard to the clinical trial system, ASCO’s Survey on COVID-19 in Oncology Registry (www.asco.org/asco-coronovirus-information/coronavirus-registry/covid-19-registry-data-dashboard) is gathering a great deal of data on the severity of COVID-19 among patients with cancer who are currently on treatment or who have recently completed treatment and are cancer-free, as well as the pandemic’s impact on the delivery of cancer care and patient outcomes.", "These data will provide information that will make our clinical trial system more resilient, flexible, and accessible.", "ASCO has a real role to play in helping push forward the key initiatives in the Road to Recovery Report, including: expanding telehealth, promoting centralized independent review board assessments of clinical trials, reducing the administrative burdens of clinical research, and underscoring the absolute need for equity health-care access for our patients.", "When will ASCO release its findings from the Survey on COVID-19 in Oncology Registry?", "We will have initial findings in the early part of 2021. There is already some information on the data collected so far from cancer institutions and oncology practices on the registry’s website, and our goal is to publish data quarterly.", "We have just submitted additional data from several hundred patients in the Sarah Cannon network, so the registry is a living database of real-time information to help inform treatment approaches for patients with the coronavirus.", "There is going to be a lot gained from the data collected in the registry, including how patients in different geographic parts of the country fared during the pandemic, especially those living in rural communities.", "Importantly, we have to continue to work with oncology practices, federal agencies, and legislators to prepare for future crises and respond quickly to ongoing challenges and opportunities.", "DISCLOSURE: Dr. Burris has served as a consultant or advisor to AstraZeneca, Bayer, Pfizer, Daiichi Sankyo, Forma Therapeutics, Celgene, Incyte, and Novartis and has received institutional research funding from Roche/Genentech, Bristol Myers Squibb, Incyte, AstraZeneca, MedImmune, MacroGenics, Novartis, Boehringer Ingelheim, Lilly, Seattle Genetics, Merck, Agios, Jounce Therapeutics, Modern Therapeutics, CytomX Therapeutics, GlaxoSmithKline, Verastem, Tesaro, BioMed Valley Discoveries, TG Therapeutics, Vertex, eFFECTOR Therapeutics, Janssen, Gilead Sciences, BioAtla, CicloMed, Harpoon Therapeutics, Arch, Arvinas, Revolution Medicines, Array BioPharma, Bayer, BIND Therapeutics, Kymab, miRNA Therapeutics, Pfizer, Takeda/Millennium, and Foundation Medicine.", "1.

Global private equity deal volume in 2020 increased approximately 22% over 2019, ending the year at approximately $582 billion.", "Meanwhile, publicly announced hostile and unsolicited M&A declined significantly, falling to $152 billion in 2020, from $306 billion in 2019.", "While the second half of 2020 saw a significant rebound in M&A that has continued into the beginning of 2021, the uncertainty regarding the duration and effects of the Covid-19 pandemic remains, with ongoing economic challenges presenting dealmakers with both risks and opportunities as the world readies to move beyond the pandemic.", "Companies with strong balance sheets are dusting off prior acquisition deal planning while assessing new opportunities in the wake of the pandemic, while those that operate in industries or markets that have been most affected by Covid-19 or otherwise fallen out of favor may be considering divestitures, restructurings and other strategic transactions to adapt to new circumstances.", "In addition, the significant changes caused, or rapidly accelerated, by the response to Covid-19 – including everything from consumer shopping habits to the role of technology in the workplace, from energy consumption patterns to real estate utilization, and so much more – are likely to be significant factors in M&A activity over the coming year and beyond.", "We review below some of the key themes that drove M&A activity in 2020 and our expectations for 2021.", "In an unprecedented year, dealmakers proved adept at responding to the extraordinary challenges brought on by a global lockdown, closed borders and turmoil in financial markets, particularly early in the year.", "The effect of the Covid-19 pandemic on companies’ financial condition, earnings and prospects – as a result of remote workforces, brick-and-mortar locations subject to capacity limits or total closure, reduced consumer spending, etc. – led not only to significant litigation relating to a number of pending transactions, but also to reevaluation and innovation in contractual technology for new deals that have been agreed during the last several months.", "Material adverse effect definitions have been one area of focus, with close attention paid both to carveouts for changes to non-firm specific conditions (such as pandemics and global economic impacts), as well as disproportionate impact exceptions to those carveouts (including how to measure such impacts and how to compare peer firms that found themselves operating in different pandemic-related regulatory conditions).", "In addition, dealmakers have revisited interim operating covenant provisions that were once considered routine, including what it means for a company to operate in the “ordinary course” during unprecedented times, what exceptions should be allowed as a result of deviations from standard operating procedure that may be mandated or recommended by government officials, and the bases upon which a buyer should, or should not, be permitted to withhold consent to requests for exceptions, particularly in contexts in which target companies may require rapid responses as they react to fast-moving developments.", "Although the pandemic will hopefully recede from the forefront in the near future, we expect the lessons learned will ensure that many of these pandemic-driven innovations-by-necessity will remain a fixture as sophisticated parties give careful consideration to risk allocation in the face of the unpredictable.", "The tech sector continued to lead overall M&A in 2020, with nearly 20% of global M&A volume and 28% of U.S. M&A volume involving a tech company as an acquiror or target, compared to 12% and 16%, respectively, three years earlier.", "A tech company was a transaction participant in six of the top 20 global deals, and six of the top 20 U.S. deals, in 2020.", "Notable tech M&A transactions included Salesforce’s $27.7 billion acquisition of Slack, Analog Device’s $21 billion acquisition of Maxim, the $9.2 billion acquisition of eBay’s classifieds business by Adevinta, Uber’s $2.7 billion acquisition of Postmates and combination of its autonomous vehicles platform with Aurora, and the $10.2 billion acquisition of RealPage by Thoma Bravo, as well as HP’s successful defense against a $34 billion hostile takeover attempt by Xerox.", "The past year also witnessed robust tech company IPO activity, with $23 billion raised in 44 IPOs in the United States, reversing a trend of prior years, as a number of companies that had extended private lifecycles chose to take advantage of strong equity capital markets, particularly in the second half of the year, as well as favorable post-IPO trading patterns.", "In addition, more companies chose the direct listing route in 2020, and while the underwritten IPO remains by far the most prevalent path, direct listings may become more common in light of the SEC’s approval of the NYSE’s Primary Direct Floor Listing, allowing companies to sell shares in a direct listing (Nasdaq has a similar proposed rule change currently pending with the SEC).", "As a result of these dynamics, private companies that in prior periods might have explored the path that was most in favor at that time – whether that was a private fundraising round, an IPO or M&A – are in many cases maintaining optionality to determine the best outcome, from a value perspective and for future growth, by taking an “all of the above” approach.", "Looking forward, we expect tech M&A to continue to drive a significant portion of overall M&A activity in 2021, with companies inside and outside the sector looking to respond to the impact of Covid-19 and the resulting changes in consumer behavior and workplace dynamics, drive enhanced growth, stay a step ahead of competitors and react to rapid innovation and ongoing disruption.", "In addition to continued IPO activity, there are likely to be a number of additional special purpose acquisition company (SPAC) transactions in the technology sector in 2021, with one significant deal – Social Finance’s $8.7 billion merger with Social Capital Hedosophia – already announced during the first week of the new year.", "In certain cases, however, this activity will take place against growing scrutiny – not only from U.S. and foreign antitrust regulators, but also from national security authorities, elected officials, consumers and the media – regarding everything from the alleged dominance of certain digital platforms with significant user bases to the personal data that technology companies control.", "Where these factors may be at play, careful pre-signing diligence and thoughtful risk allocation provisions in transaction agreements will be important to ensuring deals are successful.", "Global M&A volume in the financial services industry was nearly $518 billion in 2020 and closed the year at a torrid pace.", "Bank M&A saw a resurgence of larger transactions,

No other factor has had more of an impact on financial services M&A than regulation.", "The financial crisis and the resulting regulatory onslaught significantly reduced the level of bank M&A in particular for years to come.", "The scope and extent of the Biden Administration’s impact can only be assessed once the senior-level appointments are finalized and the legislative agenda becomes clearer.", "In 2020, SPAC volume, in both offerings and M&A activity, set records, although views differ as to whether the SPAC bonanza will continue this torrid pace.", "An immense surge of offerings, including many by vehicles with high-profile sponsors, led SPACs to raise a total of $83.4 billion of proceeds from 248 IPOs, dramatically eclipsing the previous records, set in 2019, when SPACs raised $13.6 billion in 59 IPOs.", "The average size of SPAC IPOs also grew from approximately $230 million in 2019 to more than $336 million in 2020, with five SPACs raising over $1 billion in the past year after none exceeded that mark in 2019.", "The de-SPAC side of the SPAC lifecycle also witnessed significant activity in 2020, with SPACs announcing 100 acquisitions (compared to just 39 in 2019), nearly half of which were transactions valued at $1 billion or more.", "With a record amount of SPAC capital chasing private targets, there is more focus than ever on the dilution that comes from the sponsor’s “promote,” typically set at 20% in a traditional SPAC.", "Some recent SPAC offerings have seen sponsors experiment with different economic models, taking less upfront dilution, in return for more performance-based upside on the backend, and it remains to be seen whether sponsor economics will evolve in this way or through other innovations.", "As SPACs have moved to the mainstream, many large, well-regarded financial institutions and private equity firms have begun to sponsor acquisition vehicles, while a number of prominent former public company executives have established or partnered with SPACs, often with the goal of acquiring targets in their industries of expertise.", "Not coincidentally, a growing number of de-SPAC deal announcements have been well received by investors, and in recent months, many companies that have gone public through de-SPAC transactions have maintained stock prices well above the SPACs’ IPO prices.", "These developments have helped to separate the blank check vehicles from their historical association with financial underperformance and high-risk transactions and make the SPAC a fixture of the current M&A environment.", "SPACs pitch to targets considering a traditional IPO with promises of early price discovery, quicker access to liquidity, the opportunity to partner with respected members of the SPAC management team and prominent PIPE investors, and greater flexibility for transaction-related publicity.", "Balanced against these potential advantages are a number of considerations, including additional costs as a result of the SPAC structure and the possibility that after the target and the SPAC reach an agreement on key economic terms, those terms will have to be renegotiated, potentially more than once, first to secure the backing of PIPE investors and then to avoid excess redemptions by the SPAC’s public shareholders, who ultimately control the fate of the transaction.", "Whether SPACs maintain their current momentum remains to be seen, but given the record number of SPACs now searching for targets, with record levels of cash to spend, SPACs are likely to continue to play an important role in the deal landscape in the year to come, offering private targets an alternative to M&A suitors and the traditional IPO, with both advantages and risks relative to those other options that must be carefully evaluated by companies and their advisors.", "The Covid-19 pandemic may have closed physical borders, but cross-border dealmaking was nonetheless robust, with $1.3 trillion of deals, representing an increase of 11% over 2019.", "Approximately 65% of this volume came during the second half of the year. Cross-border deals represented approximately 35% of all M&A in 2020, with major transactions including AstraZeneca’s $39 billion acquisition of Alexion, NVIDIA’s $40 billion acquisition of Arm, 7‑Eleven’s $21 billion acquisition of Speedway and Siemens Healthineers’ $16 billion acquisition of Varian Medical Systems, as well as the $44 billion S&P Global-IHS Markit transaction.", "Looking ahead to 2021 and beyond, we expect cross-border activity to be shaped by a number of dynamics, including emergence from the pandemic; the completion of the Brexit transition period and EU-UK trade deal, which have resolved, at least in part, a significant area of uncertainty that has loomed over international dealmaking over the past several years; and global geopolitical tensions, with U.S.-China relations at the forefront, which may operate both to drive, and dampen, deal activity in key technology, financial services, energy and other sectors, as evidenced by a number of recent high profile cases where governmental authorities have stepped in to demand, or block, significant transactions.", "As a result of this climate, the premium on advance preparation for the political, regulatory and cultural challenges that cross-border transactions can pose has never been higher.", "With a record amount of dry powder available, global private equity deal volume increased approximately 22% in 2020 compared to 2019, ending the year at approximately $582 billion.", "The increase in activity came in spite of traditional PE acquisitions proving somewhat challenging – during the first half of the year, debt markets were constrained while equity markets experienced significant volatility, and then both recovered in tandem during the second half, with the quick rebound in many companies’ stock prices making public acquisition target valuations potentially less attractive.", "In response to this dynamic, PE firms were creative in putting capital to use in other ways – for example, as a source of liquidity for a number of companies in industries that experienced the most acute impact of the pandemic and found that more traditional avenues of funding from banks or public markets were unavailable on terms acceptable to the company in question, as occurred with the $1.2 billion investment by Apollo and Silver Lake in Expedia.", "And as M&A bounced back in late 2020, so did more traditional PE acquisitions, with the year ending with the marquis $10.2 billion acquisition of real estate software company RealPage by Thoma Bravo, a transaction that featured a $7.4 billion equity commitment from a single firm, among the largest in recent financial sponsor history.", "Going forward, we expect PE firms to continue to actively pursue acquisitions while reassessing the prospects of their existing portfolio companies and their eventual exit paths in the wake of Covid-19, a process which may lead to further M&A activity – such as portfolio company sales between PE firms – as the pandemic recedes.", "A recent decision in the Southern District of New York, In re Nine West LBO Securities Litigation Case, is worth noting with respect to leveraged transactions.", "In Nine West, the court declined to grant a motion to dismiss, finding that the business judgment rule would not shield directors who allegedly acted recklessly in failing to conduct a reasonable investigation into the company’s post-sale solvency, taking into account plans for a post-closing carve-out and additional debt incurrence.", "The court also found that the target’s directors could, if the facts alleged are ultimately proven, be held liable for aiding and abetting breaches of fiduciary duties by the company’s new directors, as they could be charged with actual or constructive knowledge that the new board members would carry out post-sale transactions that would leave the company insolvent.", "The decision suggests that, in the leveraged buyout context, when exercising the board’s traditional duty to obtain the highest value reasonably available in a sale of the company, directors should be mindful of the post-sale solvency of the company, to the extent contemplated post-closing transactions that may jeopardize the ongoing viability of the corporation are known to the target board.", "The number of significant activist campaigns fell to 569 in 2020, from 643 in 2019 and 623 in 2018. Likewise, the number of activism campaigns relating to M&A, including demands to pursue strategic alternatives, also declined, finishing 2020 down 37% from 2019 levels.", "A number of factors contributed to the decline in activism, including deal-related campaigns, in 2020.", "Among others, these included the significant threat many companies faced to their financial condition at the outset of the pandemic, which made it difficult for activists to credibly agitate for M&A or other extraordinary actions as their would-be targets were scrambling for liquidity; significant market volatility, which challenged the ability of activists and other shareholders to anticipate stock price performance and potential investor reaction to activists’ M&A and other demands; disruption to annual meeting timing and logistics, as well as banking, brokerage and SEC operations, especially during the first half of the year; greater uncertainty with respect to shareholder vote outcomes, as often it was not clear how investors would react to activist campaigns in the midst of ongoing economic dislocation, while boards of directors and management teams were working around the clock to save their companies; and the fact that activists themselves may have had to spend more time reassessing their portfolios, trying to preserve value where the investment thesis (e.g., capital return or M&A) was no longer viable while exploring new opportunities to deploy capital.", "Despite these factors, many activists were not deterred – indeed, the number of campaigns fell by less than 12% from 2019 levels, and there were a number of high-profile situations, including Elliott/Public Storage, 40 North/GCP, Ortelius/Rayonier and Sachem/Elanco Animal Health.", "As the pandemic forced companies to hold virtual meetings, 2020 also saw the first activist proxy fight held via virtual meeting.", "Despite the lower number of proxy contests, the number of board seats won by activists in proxy contests actually increased substantially in 2020 over 2019.", "And as we emerge from the pandemic, many of the unprecedented circumstances that affected activist activity in 2020 have already begun to recede, and activist investors are likely to return to pre-Covid tactics, while reorienting their targets and their strategies, in 2021.", "For example, while certain traditional activist theses, such as leveraged stock buybacks, may face heightened scrutiny in the months to come, we expect activists to be aggressive in exploring new opportunities as a result of the ongoing market and broader economic disruption, including advocating for companies that remain challenged to engage in sales processes, divestitures and separation transactions to accelerate their recoveries, while pushing buy-side M&A for those in a position to go on the offensive, and looking for ways to participate in PIPE deals and other bespoke financing opportunities with companies that continue to need additional liquidity.", "In addition, as ESG becomes ever more salient, some activists have begun to direct their focus beyond more traditional areas of activist pressure, including, for example, Jeff Ubben’s recent launch of Inclusive Capital Partners, with a mandate to focus on environmental and social impact issues, as well as recent calls by newly formed activist investor group Engine No. 1 for Exxon to focus on net-zero emissions energy sources and clean energy infrastructure, a campaign supported by CalSTRS.", "ESG has reached an inflection point, with boards of directors, investors and other market participants and observers focusing on questions regarding corporate purpose and recognizing the critical importance of environmental, social and governance factors in the sustainability and long-term value creation potential of the corporation and, ultimately, broader economic prosperity.", "As ESG is increasingly incorporated into strategic and operational decision-making, it will likely become increasingly salient in the context of mergers and acquisitions.", "For example, as investor focus, and corporate accountability, around ESG metrics continue to increase, those metrics are likely to play a more important role in pre-signing due diligence and the assessment of the pro forma impact of a potential M&A transaction.", "With growing attention to the importance of human capital to the success of the firm (including the SEC’s amendment to Regulation S-K requiring companies to describe their human capital resources), deal-related synergies that are tied to workforce changes may face increased scrutiny, particularly for companies that have received government assistance during the pandemic.", "Meanwhile, companies seeking to enhance the sustainability of their businesses, for example by switching to cleaner technologies or improving product safety, may find that ESG factors drive their acquisition or disposition strategies.", "In addition, ESG-related elements of the deal story may feature more prominently in transaction announcements and roll-outs, alongside traditional talking points like economic synergies, in the years to come.", "As an example, ConocoPhillips and Concho highlighted in the press release announcing their transaction that the combined entity would be the first U.S.-based oil and gas company to adopt a Paris-aligned climate risk strategy.", "While much of the M&A landscape was disrupted during 2020, U.S. antitrust investigations and challenges to mergers and acquisitions continued unabated.", "The Federal Trade Commission and the U.S. Department of Justice continued to pursue court challenges in cases that were pending at the beginning of 2020, while the FTC initiated court challenges to block an additional seven proposed, and two consummated, transactions, and the DOJ brought two additional merger challenges.", "In addition, the FTC and DOJ required remedies in 22 transactions during 2020. Companies also abandoned a number of transactions due to antitrust agency opposition, including three deals that were called off after the agency filed its court challenge but before the court rendered its decision.", "Transaction participants that sought to rely on financial distress, particularly based on Covid-19 shutdowns, as a basis for clearing deals rarely found success in altering agency enforcement decisions.", "Although the number of notifications under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act was down for six months in 2020, the level of enforcement activity remained intense.", "Both the FTC and DOJ continued to be focused on adverse effects on innovation or nascent or potential competition concerns as a basis for many of their court challenges.", "Many cases were premised on narrow market definitions and a focus on unilateral effects. In the few cases the agencies lost, the court concluded that the economic evidence and testimony did not support the market definition asserted by the government.", "There was enforcement activity in a broad array of industries, with healthcare, pharma and consumer products and services continuing to account for a large percentage of enforcement activity at both the FTC and DOJ.", "Change in the leadership of the U.S. antitrust agencies in 2021 will not immediately impact the review process in most transactions because the administration of the antitrust laws in the United States is carried out by professional staff that tend to rely on well-established analytical frameworks.", "As such, the outcomes of most transactions can generally be predicted. The U.S. antitrust agencies will continue to scrutinize the remedies offered by transaction parties, and to prefer (1) divestitures in lieu of conduct remedies that require ongoing oversight to ensure compliance and (2) acquirors of the divestiture assets to be approved prior to closing rather than permitting divestiture buyers to be identified by the parties and approved by the agency after closing.", "What is likely to change during the Biden Administration is increased requirements in remedying concerns, particularly in vertical transactions or involving the pharmaceuticals and high-technology sectors.", "Even in transactions that raise concerns, however, careful planning and a proactive approach to engagement with the agencies can facilitate getting the deal through.", "The scope and impact of regulatory scrutiny of foreign investments has increased throughout a number of jurisdictions worldwide.", "In the United States, the mandate of the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) has expanded significantly over the last decade, particularly following passage of the Foreign Investment Risk Review Modernization Act (FIRRMA) in 2018, which introduced mandatory notification requirements for certain transactions, including investments in U.S. businesses associated with critical technologies, critical infrastructure, or sensitive personal data of U.S. citizens where a foreign government has a “substantial interest” (e.g., 49% or more) in the acquiror.", "Critical technology and critical infrastructure are broad and flexible concepts, and FIRRMA expanded their scope to include “emerging and foundational technologies” used in computer storage, semiconductors and telecommunications equipment sectors and critical infrastructure in a variety of sectors.", "Supply chain vulnerabilities during the Covid-19 pandemic have also increased the likelihood that investments in U.S. healthcare, pharma and biotech companies will be closely reviewed by CFIUS.", "In addition, personal data has been a key area of scrutiny for CFIUS – indeed, most of the enforcement actions in 2020 involved concerns about Chinese investors’ access to sensitive personal data of U.S. citizens.", "CFIUS enforcement in these sectors is likely to continue during the Biden Administration. At the same time, the United States is likely to remain open to foreign investment, even in the national security sector.", "Most foreign investment will still be cleared, including Chinese investments, although they may get close review and possibly require mitigation actions, especially to the extent they involve intellectual property, personal data and cutting-edge or emerging technologies.", "Several jurisdictions outside of the United States also have foreign investment regimes in place to review transactions that involve companies with national defense, critical technology and critical infrastructure implications.", "Not only did the number of jurisdictions with foreign investment laws increase in 2020, but for some jurisdictions, the scope and level of activity notably expanded.", "For example, significant changes within the European Union – both at the EU and Member State level – were adopted.", "Also, in November 2020, the government of the United Kingdom introduced a National Security and Investment Bill to the House of Commons, which meaningfully expands the power of the UK government to review and intervene in UK in-bound foreign investment to address actual or potential risks to national security.", "Similar to foreign investment and national security regimes under CFIUS and in other jurisdictions, this bill provides for expansive powers with little practical guidance as to how it will be administered.", "As in the United States, the pandemic has increased the focus on domestic supply of medical devices, pharmaceuticals and any products related to Covid-19.", "As with antitrust review, advanced planning for foreign investment scrutiny can be critical to the timely consummation of the transaction.", "By the end of the first quarter of 2020, as the Covid-19 pandemic and fears of a global recession roiled financial markets around the world, a decade-long run of nearly uninterrupted strength came to a grinding halt.", "U.S. investment grade risk premiums reached their highest levels since the Great Recession; the investment grade bond and commercial paper markets briefly froze; the leveraged loan and high-yield bond markets seized shut; and the amount of U.S. distressed debt ballooned to nearly $1 trillion.", "Unlike in the Great Recession, global markets quickly stabilized, and markets and banks proved to be a source of strength for large and mid-sized companies of all credit profiles.", "By December, the script had reversed: investment grade spreads neared record-tight levels, CCC-rated bonds reached their lowest yields in more than five years, and the amount of U.S. distressed debt fell below pre-Covid levels to $184 billion.", "In addition, high-yield bond volumes reached their highest December level since 2006.

By maintaining a clear view of the external landscape and being able to rapidly and objectively assess a wide set of opportunities—including academic partnerships, VC investment, traditional business development, and collaborations—partnership groups help identify the right partnering synergies and partnership opportunities customized to a company’s stage of growth.", "For a large pharmaceutical company, the partnership group focuses on who the right companies are for partnering based on business goals or development needs, turning ideas—such as live-mapping opportunities and investment in capable business-development teams—into formal partnerships.", "For smaller companies, the partnership group plays a somewhat different matchmaking role, with a focus on maximizing the portfolio value.", "This can include identifying potential investors or buyout opportunities. Partnership groups can also leverage their awareness of clinical-trial candidates at major biopharmas to help small companies forge research alliances where there are pipeline synergies or increase the opportunities for new combination-therapy partnerships.", "Once a partnership is established, it is critical that progress is tracked clearly and that interventions are made where value is potentially at risk (for example, delays to clinical programs, misalignment in the development or commercialization strategy, and the attrition of key talent).", "Key performance indicators for a partnership group might include a breadth of external networks (across academia and industry), the success rate associated with securing partnerships, the top talent brought into the pharmaceutical company, the time to process the logistics of the partnership, the presence of a clear approach to track and manage the partnership, and ultimately, the value created through the efforts of this group.", "Oncology, supported by an explosion of data collection, represents the vanguard of precision medicine; this can be seen in the increasing number of distinct cancer phenotypes, patient populations, and therapy choices available.", "Within this space, biomarkers are a requisite for drug development, with the number of biomarker-coupled therapies increasing by about threefold since 2010.6 Winning requires an ability to identify suitable biomarkers, demonstrate their prognostic ability, develop suitable companion diagnostics, and reach patients who will most benefit from this innovation.", "Numerous oncogenes are already well established as biomarkers in major indications (for instance, ALK, EGFR, HER2, and ER7), with multiple targeted therapies and testing (through multigene panels) part of the standard practice in most major markets.", "As the field progresses, leaders will look for new types of biomarkers harnessing the potential of proteomic and immunological data to better target therapies (for example, improving response rate of IO therapies by better targeting specific combinations).", "Further, there is significant opportunity to use liquid biopsies to gather “real time” data of biomarkers and their response throughout treatment.", "An example of this is Guardant Health’s partnership with AstraZeneca to develop blood-based companion-diagnostic tests that support commercialization of Tagrisso and Imfinzi based on Guardant’s liquid-biopsy platform.8", "As patient populations become smaller, identifying those who may benefit most from innovative therapies will become more important.", "Pharmaceutical companies wishing to succeed in precision medicine can learn from the rare-diseases space, which combines engagement with patient-advocacy groups (for example, the role of ROS1der in the recruitment of patients for the entrectinib trial), the review of oncologists’ patient records, and partnership with testing companies to identify patients who may be suitable for therapies (both during clinical development and commercialization).", "Would you like to learn more about our Life Sciences Practice?", "Efforts to manage drug spending have increased the focus on oncology products. This can be seen in Europe, where value-based health-technology assessments (HTAs) are common, as well as the United States (through oncology formulary restrictions and increased use of oncology pathways).", "This, combined with limited data at the time of accelerated approvals, means that pharmaceutical companies are working more closely with payers to establish the value proposition of a product.", "In addition, novel high-cost modalities are forcing a change to the value proposition, from one focused on pure drug provision to a personalized-service model, requiring a go-to-market (GTM) model redesign.", "The combination of increased diversity in evidence packages and a growing focus on value elevates the importance of both health-economics-and-outcomes-research (HEOR) and pricing-and-market-access (P&MA) teams.", "HEOR teams are increasingly involved earlier in drug development to ensure that key end points and comparators are included in clinical trials, building a broader evidentiary strategy (including real-world evidence, patient-reported outcomes, meta-analyses, and registries) that demonstrates therapy value.", "Such diverse evidence packages can also be used to support indication expansion, such as Pfizer’s recent approval of Ibrance in male breast cancer based on real-world data.", "More companies should also consider the key role that P&MA teams can play, particularly in oncology, in working with payers and HTA bodies well ahead of launch to ensure dossiers are optimized (for instance, through payer advisory boards).", "Further, more advanced companies may engage in launch-sequence modeling and value decisions to maximize therapy potential.", "Pharmaceutical companies must be able to choose the right narrative to communicate product value, for example, through advanced and direct comparisons.", "Within pricing and contracting, innovative schemes (for instance, around drug portfolios) and outcomes-based contracts are becoming important in product strategy given external pressures such as increased competition and greater focus on oncology pricing.", "As an example, the median annual cost of a new cancer drug launched in 2017 exceeded $150,000,9 and the cost pressure is even higher for novel therapies (such as CAR-T-cell therapies), given the added challenge of determining a viable pricing model for one-time cures.", "While there are complexities and challenges in setting up outcome-based payments schemes (for instance, price-reporting requirements in the United States10), examples do exist in oncology, including Novartis’s innovative contract for CAR-T-cell therapy, Kymriah, in Germany and the United States.", "As part of the agreement, Novartis shares the risk by partially reimbursing treatment costs if a patient dies of their illness within a given period.", "Earlier in 2019 in the United States, Novartis and Gilead Sciences obtained a new diagnosis-related group code with higher reimbursement amounts for Kymriah and Yescarta, respectively.11", "Oncology is characterized by a rapidly evolving and globalized standard of care. In non-small-cell lung cancer, for example, the number of approved therapies was expected to increase from 14 in 2009 to 22 by the end of 2019.12", "In this context, development plans (for instance, combination partners, indication sequencing, and approval strategy) must be strategically developed making complex trade-offs that include the ability to recruit for clinical trials, cost of comparator drugs for studies, time to market, and breadth of label.", "Such an approach requires deep competitive intelligence and war-gaming type approach. Here, biopharmaceutical companies increasingly leverage adaptive trials and may increasingly explore the use of real-world evidence (RWE) to create synthetic control arms to reduce the overall size (and cost) of trials and ensure that as many patients as possible can receive the most-effective therapies in development.", "As treatment paradigms become more complex and trial recruitment more competitive, patient centricity is also ever more important.", "For clinical trials, support centers that work to improve patient experiences can be a key differentiator in competitive populations.", "From a patient perspective, best-in-class trials could include providing information that helps them choose between competing trials, giving access to planning tools to help with logistics and cost minimization, and remote monitoring to reduce the time in a hospital.", "For in-market drugs, patient services are becoming more critical and expanding in scope, driven by novel modalities (such as CAR-T therapy) and complex modes of treatment.", "While historically, patient services have focused on reimbursement and access, companies are now increasing their focus on onboarding, disease management, and adherence through internal or outsourced capabilities.", "Best-in-class patient-service practices include a single point of contact for patients throughout the journey, seamless coordination between call-center and field-based resources, and the integration of digital and analytics into workflows to make the experience more individualized for patients and doctors.", "The provision of more holistic support beyond the brand is important and can include support with nutrition, general wellness, disease management, or the set-up of peer-to-peer communities.", "As a highly competitive field, oncology requires robust key-account-management capabilities. This includes building strong relationships with all key stakeholders (such as group purchasing organizations or “GPOs,” insurers, and hospital procurement departments) that create a partnership-style dynamic (rather than that of a buyer).", "The key account manager will always be thinking about what the stakeholder challenges are and will help them accordingly: engaging with hospitals at a population level to support pathway-based conversations, for instance, will help inform marketing strategies and refine the discourse of field teams.", "This is complemented by a sales force with a deep understanding of complex therapies and changing landscapes.", "Accordingly, oncology sales reps are typically higher paid than those in other TAs and also heavily incentivized based on performance.", "For the medical organization, the role of the medical-science liaison (MSL) is also important. They must be scientifically credible, cutting through a complex array of publications, changing pathways, and standards of care while supporting oncologists in understanding the latest innovations (in addition to supporting patients in accessing treatment).", "Further, the medical organization maintains its important relationship with physicians through investigator-initiated-trial (IIT) programs, high-quality continuing medical education, virtual advisory boards, and remote congress attendance, while also accessing key opinion leaders (key influencers of prescribing behavior).", "Across both commercial and medical, sophisticated physician mapping can identify areas of unmet need as well as segment physicians to ensure, for example, that they receive the most-relevant information for their practice.", "This can be combined with digital engagement to build bespoke physician experiences and interactions across multiple channels.", "In the best cases, the physician journey will evolve as they engage with the field force and digital media.", "Where pharmaceutical companies have multiple therapies that are prescribed by a single physician, the go-to-market model deploys algorithms that can integrate and customize the information that a physician receives across multiple brands.", "Finally, it is critical for commercial and medical organizations to seek feedback from the field and connect the insights back to the overall strategy (for instance, through customer-relationship-management data analysis and machine learning).", "Pharmaceutical companies must be able to respond rapidly to the feedback received from the field and adapt their strategy as needed (Exhibit 2).", "To be successful in oncology, a focus on capabilities is critical—not only on what is in place today, but also a plan for building the new capabilities that are essential for becoming a leader in key strategic areas.", "Capabilities span beyond individuals and can include supporting technology, processes, and ways of working; for example, access to data (across R&D and commercial), analytical engines, and oncology-specific governance to allow for fast decision making.", "The three steps to building best-in-class capabilities are:", "- Create an integrated view. By creating a single integrated view that describes the capabilities needed, this ensures an approach that is consistent across global and key markets (such as the United States, which represents 52 percent of all oncology sales,13 and China, which is a key growth market).", "Depending on a company’s operating model, specific capabilities may be in global or local teams—regardless, access to capabilities around P&MA, patient engagement, commercial analytics, and medical is needed across major markets.", "- Decide when to leverage resources outside the company. Not all capabilities need to be built in-house.", "For certain capabilities, “talent beyond the payroll” and partnerships—such as partnering on specific analytical capabilities or data sets—can be better solutions.", "Where capabilities are desired in-house, a clear value proposition must be developed and articulated to attract the best talent (likely combining compensation, career progression, and working environment).", "- Focus on retention for top talent. Given the extreme competition for talent in oncology, companies must develop a strategy on how they can attract (and retain) top players.", "Successful strategies often include a combination of competitive salaries and incentives, clear development opportunities and pathways, and an oncology vision and portfolio that motivates members of the organization.", "Finally, having in place systems that consistently track talent, capabilities, and resource allocation are critical for planning and enable faster decision making, both at the region level and globally.", "Strategic workforce planning (hiring, partnerships, consortia, and acquisitions) should also be embedded into business-planning cycles.", "Companies that build these measures into their best practices will be successful in having the right capabilities in place and staying ahead in the fast-moving and competitive oncology arena."]}

Touting an exceptionally high mortality rate, between 70-90 percent, books and movies fill our shelves, dedicated to telling its terrifying story.", "As the origin of EBOV is still yet to be found, the virus remains a recurring danger, and each reemergence seems to bring with it its own unique set of challenges.", "Yet, merely six months after the most recent 2020 EBOV outbreak was identified, it was officially declared over by the Minister of Health of the DRC.", "Successful rapid response to this latest outbreak did not happen by chance. Control over this outbreak was only possible thanks to the groundwork laid by an intricate network of organizations, through years of coordination of efforts.", "“Novelists and screenwriters would have a difficult time coming up with something more horrifying than the filovirus, Ebola,” said Charles Paschal, Assistant Program Manager for the JPEO-CBRND’s Joint Project Manager for Chemical, Biological, Radiological, and Nuclear Medical (JPM CBRN Medical).", "“I don’t think people realize the terrible monster that barely made it out of its cave.”", "The DOD has a long-standing history of developing medical countermeasures to combat deadly biological threats, and the JPM CBRN Medical’s fingerprints can be found all over its Ebola response efforts.", "The JPM CBRN Medical organization is dedicated to developing and delivering medical countermeasure solutions to diagnose, treat, and protect our nation’s warfighters from CBRN threats, to include weaponized biological or naturally-occurring agents like EBOV.", "Through a three-pronged, full-spectrum program approach, the approach is to attack threats at every angle: through diagnostic program efforts dedicated to delivering early identification solutions (see it), therapeutic program efforts dedicated to delivering treatment solutions (treat it), and vaccine program efforts dedicated to delivering solutions to prevent infection (prevent it).", "When dealing with any CBRN threat, you must first be able to see it.", "The world has known about these filoviruses since the 1970’s, but according to Paschal, the 1989 ‘Ebola Reston’ incident is what really “changed the game.”", "The events of the 1989 EBOV outbreak in Reston, Virginia - which inspired the 1994 best-selling nonfiction novel “The Hot Zone” and subsequently led to the creation of the 1995 movie blockbuster “Outbreak” - undoubtedly captured the world’s attention; and although exaggerated and “creatively adapted,” as all Hollywood movies are, both the novel and movie did manage to inspire an awareness and fear of the all-too-real virus.", "The later 2014-2016 West Africa Ebola outbreak, the first and largest epidemic of its kind, was yet another wake-up call that made clear the danger EBOV disease (EVD) posed to not just U.S. national security interests abroad, but to the U.S. domestic population in the event of a pandemic.", "The worlds eyes were opened to just how important proactive preparation would be to mitigating future occurrences; reinforcing the dire need for both an efficacious vaccine against highly-pathogenic filoviruses like EBOV, and diagnostic capabilities to identify it.", "The importance of diagnostic capabilities cannot be overstated when it comes to infectious disease response efforts, and the DOD-funded Warrior Panel diagnostic test was the JPM CBRN Medical’s first blow against EBOV.", "The JPM CBRN Medical’s established partnership with BioFire Defense, LLC, resulted in development of the Next Generation Diagnostics System 1 (NGDS 1), known commercially as the BioFire® FilmArray®, a diagnostic tool used in hospitals and clinical settings around the world, including the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Laboratory Response Network.", "From that initial collaborative effort came the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved Warrior Panel, used in conjunction with the BioFire® FilmArray®, for the diagnosis of anthrax, tularemia, plague, Q fever, and hemorrhagic fevers caused by Ebola and Marburg viruses.", "Once you are able to see the threat, you must have the capabilities in place to treat it.", "Following the 2014 EBOV outbreak, there was also advocacy for the capability to execute clinical trials in an outbreak setting, which led to the JPEO-CBRND’s establishment of the Joint Mobile Emerging Disease Intervention Clinical Capability (JMEDICC) facility at Fort Portal Regional Referral Hospital in Western Uganda.", "The JMEDICC project had a primary objective of establishing the technical capability to execute Phase II clinical trials during outbreaks of high-consequence pathogens, like EBOV.", "Establishment of the JMEDICC facility in 2016 enabled and trained partners to have the capability to rapidly diagnose, isolate, and treat individuals with EVD, as close as possible to the outbreak, with medical countermeasures in clinical research settings; under appropriate Institutional Review Board approvals and all applicable law and regulatory requirements.", "Thanks to the JMEDICC facility - which utilized the latest JPM CBRN Medical’s NGDS technology, to include the newly-developed Ebola panels - responders were able to better track the spread of EBOV outbreaks, which was a key component of outbreak response in the area.", "The facility met the DOD’s intent for foreign humanitarian assistance, supporting Uganda while also providing a unique opportunity to conduct research during outbreak response.", "Once you see and understand the threat, you can finally develop and deliver solutions to prevent it.", "Fast forward to December 20, 2019, the FDA announced the approval of the first FDA-approved vaccine for the prevention of EVD: Merck & Co.’s Ervebo®.", "The FDA’s approval of Ervebo® was the result of nearly two decades of efforts by a host of teams across both the public and private sectors.", "The approval was a major leap forward in protecting both the warfighter and civilian populations from EVD, as well as advancing U.S. government (USG) preparedness efforts.", "“I really don’t think anyone realizes that we just defeated the most deadly virus known to man in all of human history,” said Paschal.", "“Ebola is a monster the likes of which has never been seen before.

When I was serving in several roles as part of a lean and aspirational management team at Gilead in the late 1990s and early 2000s, Martin was the boss.", "I got to see how he set direction and how the organization responded. Long after I moved on, I saw how this quiet leader continued to envision and execute on the big, long-term strategies that he set in motion in Gilead’s adolescent years.", "John did not dress to impress, only donning a conservative suit and tie when it was necessary as a respectful obligation for an important meeting or an investment conference.", "His business casual attire of neutral colors and pattern-less sport coats seemed intended to not allow any distraction from his words and the ideas he wanted to convey.", "He didn’t focus on selling a future vision of Gilead. He was more likely to be touting the latest approved drug or the importance of a recent company initiative.", "John didn’t try to persuade with a dynamic or stylized narrative, but rather by clearly communicating a core idea in the simplest and most straight-forward manner possible, often with just a short statement or a Socratic question.", "He was a leader who listened and observed far more than he spoke. When he spoke, he did it with piercing intent.", "When John asked you a question in a meeting, it sometimes felt like a test. John likely already knew the answer or had a better answer than what you might muster up.", "John could make one comment or a short statement in a meeting and change the entire trajectory of the conversation.", "He displayed an efficiency of words that was focused on communicating with clarity about a key concept or an action to be taken.", "At the end of a meeting with John, there was little room for interpretation or doubt about what to do next.", "He was uninterested in the spotlight. He let other executives do the talking for Gilead. He never sought awards.", "These performance metrics led Harvard Business Review in 2010 to rank Martin #6 in their first edition of “Best Performing CEOs in the World” (Steve Jobs was #1).", "A few years later, Martin moved up to #2 behind Amazon’s Jeff Bezos.", "During John’s tenure, Gilead went from a company valued in the hundreds of millions to one of the few biotech companies to achieve a $100 billion-plus valuation.", "Today, it’s the second highest-valued biopharma company ranking behind only Amgen.", "During my tenure at Gilead (1997-2005), Martin’s office was austere. He worked at a simple uncluttered desk.", "Framed group photos highlighting Gilead’s history decorated the walls. A few sample bottles of Gilead’s approved products sat on the windowsill.", "There was a small conference table where I remember weekly tactical meetings would be held with selected members of the management team to go through John’s questions and tasks that he would accumulate over the week and would write down as a to-do list on a yellow legal pad.", "If John was not in team meetings or walking around the corporate campus dropping in people’s offices, he was often at his desk tapping away at his laptop.", "I saw his routines out of the corner of my eye. My office was two doors down from John and next door to the “other John,” John F. Milligan – the longtime chief operating officer and eventual CEO of Gilead.", "Early employees, to make sure they didn’t confuse one for the other, sometimes referred, with brevity, to ‘JCM’ and ‘JFM.’", "I was an early riser, often arriving at work between 6 am and 6:30 am. That meant I was often first in the office.", "Let me correct that: I was often second, because John was already there. If he wasn’t, it probably meant he was traveling.", "I didn’t want to leave that office next to John, even for a promotion. When I was tasked with leading Gilead Medical Affairs, I was supposed to move to the R&D building where my new boss, Norbert Bischofberger, was located.", "I dragged my feet for a year, with the lame excuse that I was too busy to move my things to a new office.", "John loved to work. One Saturday morning on the day of Gilead’s annual company picnic, a beach event at Half Moon Bay, I stopped by the office in Foster City first to get a little work done.", "I tried to make some small talk, which was always a bit awkward. That wasn’t his forte.", "“Are you excited to go to the company picnic?” I asked.", "“I’d rather be spending the day working, but I guess people are expecting me to be there,” he said.", "John would later be seen at the picnic chatting with employees, watching others play volleyball and eating barbecue.", "But the small talk of those huddled around him inevitably turned, and as most casual conversations almost always did with John, to the excitement of the work.", "Never have I experienced anyone with the tireless work ethic and persistent drive as John. His dedication to the vision of Gilead and getting quality products to the patients that needed them was an inspiration to all of us who worked for him.", "John started his career on the science side. He received a PhD in Organic Chemistry from University of Chicago.", "He then worked at Syntex and Bristol Myers as a medicinal chemist leading antiviral drug programs.", "While at Syntex, he decided to strengthen his business understanding and pursued an MBA in Marketing from Golden Gate University.", "John’s understanding of business and marketing along with his grounding in antiviral chemistry proved to be a potent combination.", "Martin came to work at Gilead in 1990, when it was a startup working on antisense oligonucleotide drug candidates.", "He was named CEO in 1996. One of the first things he did was drop the antisense oligonucleotide work.", "The delivery challenges and high cost of goods meant it would probably take 20 years for these therapies to pan out, he reasoned.", "That decision to stop doing antisense work was just as important as his decision shortly thereafter to bet the company on antivirals.", "While thinking through this strategic pivot, John saw that antiretroviral cocktail therapies were emerging as the most potent weapons yet in the AIDS epidemic.", "The multi-drug combinations had turned the disease into a manageable chronic condition.", "But many of the drugs required multiple pills taken several times throughout the day. Some had to be taken with food, some without.", "Patients had a pill burden of more than 20 pills taken at multiple time points over the day. Simply scheduling a daily regimen was a burdensome task and made it difficult for patients to fully adhere to prescriptions needed to keep the virus in check.", "John unified Gilead around the easy-to-understand vision of “one pill, once a day.” It became the north star for the company.", "With that vision in mind, Gilead acquired Triangle Pharmaceuticals to obtain a second “backbone” nucleoside analogue to combine with Gilead’s own tenofovir.", "Rounding out the plan, Gilead formed a collaboration with BMS for the third drug component, the NNRTI efavirenz, and later for another BMS drug, the protease inhibitor atazanavir.", "With those pieces in place, Gilead was on its way to dominating the HIV marketplace. Gilead’s drugs worked against the virus.", "That was clear. But they won in the marketplace because they enriched patient quality of life and made it easier for patients to stick to the instructions on the prescribing label.", "In the mid-90s, almost every pharmaceutical company was seeking a piece of the HIV therapeutics market.", "Competitors included GSK, BMS, Pfizer, Abbott, Roche, and Merck. But the little biotech from Foster City, California, over the course of a decade, reigned supreme as the world’s largest maker of HIV medicines.", "John didn’t stop there. The next clear goal was to develop or find the best-in-class treatment for HCV (hepatitis C virus).", "Gilead toiled on this work for more than a decade before acquiring Pharmasset and finishing work on what became the dominant cure for HCV.", "Pricing and access to medicines were perennial thorny issues at Gilead. The critics were relentless and vocal.", "John handled these issues with aplomb — working methodically behind the scenes. He saw to it that Gilead’s HIV drugs could be manufactured at cost by local manufacturers in developing countries.", "He pressed teams to develop a pre-exposure prophylaxis, or PrEP, strategy to prevent HIV in high-risk individuals.", "He persisted in multiple attempts to diversify Gilead beyond its core antiviral franchises. Not all of these acquisitions were successful – cardiovascular disease and pulmonary hypertension were a couple of areas where Gilead struggled to gain traction.", "In his last major act as CEO, Martin oversaw the acquisition of Kite Pharma and its CAR-T platform to strengthen the company’s oncology and cell therapy bona fides.", "It’s a bold bet on the future that will take years to pay off.", "Throughout, John emphasized that Gilead be outward-looking. This was exemplified during the development and commercialization of Gilead’s initial HIV and HBV drugs.", "John expected that the top researchers and clinicians would personally know the top managers at Gilead.", "John set the example himself. Every month, he would visit clinicians, often with a Gilead sales rep. He used the opportunity to conduct his own market research to help the drive the company’s clinical development pipeline strategy, anticipate objections to product adoption or exploit opportunities to position Gilead’s products more favorably vis-à-vis our competitors.", "My first few months at Gilead were spent traveling the world visiting every top expert HBV clinician to learn about the disease, the current state of treatment and what outcomes would be most meaningful.", "This was market intel we would use to shape clinical development strategy.", "John hungered for this kind of market knowledge so much, that he wanted it woven into the company’s cultural fabric.", "When I was asked to lead Medical Affairs a few months before the introduction of Gilead’s first HIV drug, tenofovir (Viread), John handed me a business card of a physician he had recently met in one of the largest HIV-treating practices in New York’s Greenwich Village.", "Fly to New York the next weekend to meet him, John said. And don’t come back until the doctor agrees to join us as a medical science liaison, he added.", "John told me he had planted the seed and that I just needed to convince the doctor that he could impact more patient lives by helping to educate other clinicians on his experience and how they could treat their patients optimally using Gilead’s drugs.", "That was the first of many MDs, PhDs and PharmDs that were hired to build credible relationships between Gilead and the medical community.", "This close working relationship extended beyond researchers and clinicians to the patient community. While almost every rare disease company knows the power of engaging with patient advocates, John was doing it with many HIV advocates in a thoughtful, sensitive and collaborative manner long before it was vogue.", "We discussed access, pricing, and feedback on marketing messages.", "I took many of these principles with me in meetings with Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy patients and advocates when I later became CEO of Sarepta Therapeutics.", "John Martin didn’t feel compelled to show everyone how smart he was, but he had a fierce intellect. He was a man of ideas.", "It seemed as if his mind never stopped working and he was always 10 steps ahead of everyone else. He read philosophy with practical aims in mind.", "A few days after a meeting on organizational effectiveness, John gave me a copy of Nietzsche’s “Beyond Good and Evil.”", "He explained the dynamics of managers and subordinates and how those in authority are often perceived wrongly in terms of ethics and intention by those who work for them.", "A couple weeks later, I gave him Hobbes’ “Leviathan.” We discussed how to best tame a growing organization and keep it from getting unwieldy and unmanageable.", "Every discussion of ideas was anchored in application to our day-to-day work.", "There is a long list of Gilead alumni and current employees, like me, who would call John their most influential mentor.", "While some of us left Gilead prior to John’s departure at the end of 2018 (I left in 2005), there was quite an exodus in recent years of senior leaders who spent the bulk of their careers at Gilead and have now moved on to be CEOs and board members for other companies.", "John never sought glory, but was glorified by so many of us who knew him and had the pleasure of working with him.", "Glory is defined in numerous ways but the word most commonly means “high renown or honor won by notable achievements” and “magnificence or great beauty,” as well as “praise, worship and thanksgiving offered to a deity.”", "As I read about his death last week, I realized that his understated and humble style did not allow him to receive the glory that he deserved from the industry that benefited so much from his contributions.", "But he has provided a tremendous legacy for those that learned from him and a beautiful standard for us to strive toward, to measure ourselves against, and to carry forward."]}

This year, under a new leadership team, the company inked more than half a dozen deals that provide access to a slate of experimental cancer drugs and a marketed therapy for breast tumors.", "At a combined value of over $27 billion, the deals are Gilead's most substantial push yet to transform into a leader in cancer treatment.", "\"Gilead had a very clear ambition to move into oncology,\" Andrew Dickinson, the company's chief financial officer, told BioPharma Dive.", "\"And what you saw in 2020 was really a culmination of that work.\"", "The deals are a starting point.

There were a few defining acquisitions — the 2003 purchase of Triangle Pharmaceuticals, which bolstered Gilead's position in HIV treatment, and the 2011 takeover of Pharmasset, which handed Gilead a soon-to-be megablockbuster drug for hepatitis C. Overall, though, deals weren't its calling card.", "But by 2016, attitudes were changing. The company's hepatitis C business had peaked, and a staggering sales drop was fast approaching.", "Gilead needed new drugs, and dealmaking was one of the quicker ways to get them.", "Dickinson joined the company that year, assuming the role of senior vice president of corporate development after nearly a decade in the investment banking unit at Lazard, where he advised large biotechs such as Celgene and Amgen.", "He said there was a \"very clear mandate\" from then-CEO John Milligan to reinvent Gilead's business development strategy.", "\"We started meeting with venture capitalists,\" Dickinson said. \"We started taking our research team and flying to the east coast", "[and] Europe and San Diego, even around our hometown, traveling and meeting companies — which, again, Gilead hadn't done that much.\"", "Gilead had dabbled in smaller biotech deals before, most notably the 2011 buyout of Calistoga Pharmaceuticals and its lymphoma drug, Zydelig, which the company hoped would jumpstart an oncology business.", "Though that didn't happen, Gilead remained interested in cancer and, with Dickinson onboard, accelerated its efforts.", "In 2017, Gilead made its most significant investment in cancer drugs with the $12 billion acquisition of Kite Pharma, which launched the company to the front of an emerging field of research focused on engineering immune cells to better fight cancer.", "Kite, however, was a long-term investment, and did little to resolve Gilead's immediate problems.", "Soon after Kite, changes had come to more than just the deals team.", "Many of Gilead's top executives were replaced throughout 2019. Daniel O'Day, the former head of pharmaceuticals at Roche, came on as CEO in March.", "In the months that followed, Gilead appointed a new chief medical officer, Merdad Parsey; a new chief commercial officer, Johanna Mercier; and a CEO for Kite, Christi Shaw.", "Dickinson rounded out the list, moving into the chief financial officer role in October of that year.", "The appointments set the stage for Gilead's reinvigorated push into cancer.

Instead of pursuing many types of research, the company would specifically keep its sights on immuno-oncology, an area of study which looks at how the body's infantry of immune cells can be deployed against cancer.", "Gilead wasn't original in its focus: immunotherapy had grown to be one of the industry's hottest areas of research over the past several years, helping to reinvent the way many tumor types are treated.", "Yet, Gilead was familiar with the immune system from its work in viruses, and the thinking, according to Dickinson, was the company could use that knowledge as a foothold in cancer drug development.", "\"You can't be everything,\" he said, \"and in cancer, part of the reason that I think we struggled historically is that we were trying to look at everything.\"", "With the team and the strategy in place, Gilead went about turning the relationships it had cultivated with young biotechs over the past few years into deals.", "Early this March, the company agreed to acquire Forty Seven, a cancer drugmaker located about 10 miles south of Gilead's Foster City headquarters, for nearly $5 billion.", "In May, it paid $375 million to enter a 10-year research collaboration with another California biotech, Arcus Biosciences.", "And by the end of September, it made a series of equity investments into Pionyr Therapeutics, Tizona Therapeutics, Tango Therapeutics and Jounce Therapeutics, which, combined with collaboration fees, cost close to $850 million up front.", "\"Quite frankly, we needed to make up for where our pipeline was,\" said Devang Bhuva, Gilead's current head of corporate development, who joined the company this April after his own yearslong stint at Lazard, where he worked alongside Dickinson advising biotechs.", "Gilead would soon get its hands on another important cancer drug, as the company's biggest deal ever was right around the corner.", "In the beginning of 2019, at a popular industry conference where seeds for future deals are frequently planted, Dickinson met with representatives from a New Jersey biotech called Immunomedics.", "Immunomedics had ushered a handful of experimental cancer drugs into clinical trials since its founding in the early '80s.", "At the time of its meeting with Gilead, the biotech was waiting to hear whether its most advanced medicine, an engineered antibody for a hard-to-treat form of breast cancer, would receive approval from the Food and Drug Administration.", "The two parties talked about Immunomedics' work, about Gilead's cancer ambitions, and agreed to keep in touch over the next year and a half.", "Gilead wouldn't be the only company interested in Immunomedics.

Gilead, having seen the data early because of the partnering talks, knew they were strong and would likely bump up the price on any potential takeover bid.", "\"We expected it to turn from partnering discussions to an M&A transaction,\" he said, \"but we didn't think it was likely that someone would try to do that a week before the company's key data was going to be publicly disclosed.\"", "If Gilead wanted Immunomedics, it had to move fast.

Wall Street analysts acknowledged the high price, which was more than double Immunomedics' market value from the prior week, was likely to put off some investors, especially since it had become apparent that Gilead overpaid for Kite back in 2017.", "Trodelvy wasn't the neatest fit for Gilead's strategy, either, since it's not by definition an immuno-oncology drug.", "On the other hand, analysts expect Trodelvy to become a billion-dollar drug based solely on its first approval.", "If it were cleared for use in more cancers, sales could skyrocket.", "\"This is exactly what we have been waiting for,\" wrote the team at Piper Sandler, following the Immunomedics deal announcement.", "Trodelvy also provides Gilead, which had mostly worked in blood cancers, a foundation in solid tumors.", "According to Dickinson, Gilead envisions the drug pairing well with immuno-oncology medicines or targeted therapies, like the so-called PARP inhibitor class of medicines that's been used to treat prostate, breast and ovarian cancers.", "\"Sometimes you have to start investing in those smaller pipeline assets, where the science is great and where they match your overall strategy, and then you find the bigger pieces around which to build.", "Ten years from now, Dickinson pictures a more balanced Gilead.", "Virology would remain a core pillar, but share the weight with immuno-oncology as well as inflammation drugs, which Gilead dove into last year through a $5 billion research pact with Galapagos, a Belgian drugmaker.", "The road to that Gilead won't be without bumps. The company's already hit a setback in its Galapagos deal, and continues to face skepticism around Kite.", "And after spending $27 billion, it has yet to secure a crown jewel for its fledging immuno-oncology business like Merck & Co. did with Keytruda or Bristol Myers Squibb did with Opdivo.", "Dickinson admits there have been hard lessons. With Kite, for example, Gilead could have better communicated its expectations, he said.", "But there have been positive ones as well. At Lazard, Dickinson saw time and again big drug companies get too involved with their smaller partners and inadvertently stifle the collaboration.", "Many biotechs don't want an imposing partner or an acquisition offer. So to avoid that mistake, Gilead became more open to unconventionally structured deals, which helped forge the alliance with Galapagos and the equity stakes in Tizona and Pionyr.", "The company also looked to some of the drug industry's most prolific dealmakers for inspiration, including Jeremy Levin, who was head of strategy at Bristol Myers when it acquired the company behind Opdivo, and George Golumbeski, who led business development at Celgene for nearly a decade.", "Dickinson claims the resulting approach is still uniquely Gilead. It'll be on display for some time, too, given the company has about $11 billion left at its disposal to do more buying.", "Investors, though, aren't so convinced. Despite all the wheeling and dealing, last month, Gilead's share price hit its lowest point since 2013."]}

In the last 7 years, roughly identical percentages exist in the two charts above, suggesting that the relative contributions of IPOs and M&As at big and small valuations are similar.", "This is different than the pre-2000 world, where IPOs were clearly of average higher value based on these data.", "I’ve written in the past on subjects related to this topic, so won’t harp on them again but here are a few topics: the likelihood of earnouts getting paid on M&A deals (here), the tradeoffs between IPO-and-exit-later vs M&A today (here), and the liquidity challenge of exiting newly minted public biotech shares into the market after the lockup (here).", "The most important message in all this - it's a healthy dynamic for private biotechs to have both IPO and M&A avenues open to them, with roughly equivalent opportunities for driving top decile returning exits via either route."]}

dollars supported sofosbuvir’s development.", "Government investment in drug development should be reflected in price and access.", "The approval of sofosbuvir (Sovaldi) in 2013 transformed chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) care, but its high cost was criticized in part because of reports of substantial public involvement in its development.", "We developed a methodology to assess the public’s contribution through the National Institutes of Health (NIH) in developing sofosbuvir.", "Using key terms from the timeline of sofosbuvir, we identified articles in PubMed; linked them to federal funding using the NIH RePORTER; reviewed the title, organization, and investigator of each resulting award for relatedness; and converted related awards to 2018 US dollars.", "Of 6043 unique awards, we identified 29 that were directly (US$7.7 million) and 110 that were indirectly (US$53.2 million) related awards made to major academic institutions and companies engaged in the development of the drug.", "These findings indicate that public funding had a key role in developing sofosbuvir, with an estimated US$60.9 million provided in NIH funding.", "In current debates in the USA over the high prices of brand-name prescription drugs, a common argument used to support such prices is that they are needed to fund drug discovery and development [1].", "Although manufacturers and venture capitalists invest substantial resources in drug development, many of the most transformative drugs that have emerged in the past few decades (those that are both innovative and have a groundbreaking effect on patient care) were discovered and developed, in part, based on funding from the NIH and other public sources to academic medical centers, government laboratories, and start-up companies [2].", "One of the most transformative drugs over the past decade was sofosbuvir (Sovaldi), approved in 2013 as the first in a class of direct-acting antivirals that offered a highly effective and well-tolerated potential cure for patients with chronic HCV.", "However, controversy arose when its manufacturer launched the drug at a list price of US$84 000 per course of therapy, or ∼US$1000 per pill [3].", "During its first year on the market, sofosbuvir cost the US healthcare system nearly US$8 billion in list price expenditures [4].", "Although prices have since fallen in the ensuring years with the introduction of other direct-acting antivirals, Medicaid (the state- and federal-supported health insurance program for low-income patients) spent a reported ∼US$12 billion on HCV drugs from 2014 to 2017, which amounted to 5% of the total spending of the program for all outpatient prescriptions during that period [5].", "Some US public and private payors responded to these high prices by restricting access for patients [4].", "Patient advocates and others seeking broader availability of these drugs pointed out that this class of drugs was based, in part, on discoveries made by academic and government institutions over the course of many decades, and that sofosbuvir itself was synthesized by scientists based at a start-up company that received public support for this work through the NIH.", "This raised the question whether such an investment might mean that the public was ‘paying twice’ for their treatments [6].", "Estimates of the amount of federal funding that directly contributed to development of sofosbuvir have ranged from US$244 504 to US$1 million to US$9 million to over US$62.4 million 4, 7, 8, 9.", "These estimates indicate the lack of clarity surrounding whether and to what extent federal funding was linked to the development of the drug.", "Thus, we sought to develop a methodology for rigorously assessing NIH contributions towards developing transformative drugs and to apply it to the case of sofosbuvir.", "We first identified key persons, organizations, and other terms important to the development of sofosbuvir.", "We used the Drugs@FDA database to identify the approval date, manufacturer, and mechanism of action of sofosbuvir.", "We then reviewed the Approved Drug Products with Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations resource that lists patent and exclusivity information for US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved drug products to identify important patents associated with sofosbuvir (Appendix S1 in the supplemental information online).", "We searched the US Patent and Trademark Office database to review these patents, collecting all available information about the assignees and inventors, which served as a starting point for identifying individuals and organizations in later development.", "Finally, we further identified the institutions and individuals involved with the early development of the drug from company filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, primary investigators listed on NIH awards, and other published reports and articles.", "We used these key terms to conduct searches in the Public Library of Medicine (PubMed) database to find published articles and combined terms (e.g., inventors’ names) with ‘hepatitis C’ to narrow the results (Appendix S2 in the supplemental information online).", "For each resulting article, we linked its unique PubMed identification number (PMID) with data in the National Institute of Health (NIH) Report Portfolio Online Reporting Tool Expenditures and Results (RePORTER) Tool.", "We linked them by navigating to the ‘Advanced Search’ function on the NIH RePORTER homepage, selecting the ‘Search Publications’ tab, pasting the PMIDs into the blank text box, and conducting the search.", "The RePORTER is an electronic tool that allows the public to access information about federal awards from the NIH as far back as 1980 [10].", "The information in the RePORTER is managed by the NIH Office of Extramural Research and integrates information from electronic Research Administration (eRA) databases, Medline, PubMed Central, NIH Intramural Database, and iEdison [10].", "The awards we linked through the RePORTER were downloaded in full, duplicates deleted, and their content reviewed for relatedness to the development of sofosbuvir.", "For all awards distributed up to and including 2013, we evaluated the title, contact primary investigator (investigator), and organization to determine whether any of these were related to the development of sofosbuvir.", "Each category was scored 1 if related or 0 if not for each award. We ultimately only included awards distributed up to and including 2007 because that was the year sofosbuvir was discovered.", "A project title was considered related if the research: described or addressed the management and/or control of HCV; the development of sofosbuvir (or a closely related drug analog) or the mechanism of action of sofosbuvir; and/or included ‘HCV’ or ‘hepatitis’ and was related to drug development for this condition.", "A Cohen’s kappa statistic was calculated to quantify the level of agreement between title reviewers (R.E.B. and F.A.T.), and disagreements were resolved by a third author (A.S.K.).", "The kappa statistic was used to measure agreement [11]. This analysis was performed using STATA version 15.0 (College Station, Texas, Stata Corporation, 2017).", "A kappa statistic was calculated only for the title category because it was most subjective.", "An investigator was considered related if the person was a patent-listed inventor, founder, and/or affiliate of an organization involved with the development of sofosbuvir, or another key contributor based on our research (Appendix S3 in the supplemental information online).", "An organization was considered related if such a key investigator was affiliated with it or the organization was affiliated with a major milestone of development, like drug discovery.", "These included: Apath, Avid Therapeutics, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Emory University, Georgia State University, Gilead Sciences, Idenix Pharmaceuticals, National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK), National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease (NIAID), Pharmasset, Rockefeller University, Scripps Research Institute, Triangle Pharmaceuticals, University of Alabama, University of Georgia, the Veterans Affairs Health System, and Washington University (Appendix S4 in the supplemental information online).", "Scores from each category for each award were summed. The higher an award score, the more likely that award was related to the development of sofosbuvir.", "For all awards scoring a total of 2 or more, we reviewed the abstract of the award. Based on the score and award abstract, we determined whether it was ‘directly related,’ ‘indirectly related,’ or neither.", "For example, awards distributed to Pharmasset supporting HCV drug development were classified as directly related, whereas awards supporting research for drugs similar to sofosbuvir and by the same researchers but for a different disease were classified as indirectly related.", "Disagreements on categorizing the awards were resolved by consensus among authors. Finally, the dollar amounts of awards classified as directly or indirectly related were converted to 2018 US dollars using the US Bureau of Labor Statistics consumer price index [12].", "We identified 48 key terms, of which the largest subset was the list of patent-listed inventors (Appendices S1 and S2 in the supplemental information online).", "The PMIDs associated with published articles that resulted from the key terms searched linked to 50 575 unique NIH awards through the NIH RePORTER.", "Of those, 42 530 were awards for subprojects, which we removed because they were already accounted for in the core project awards.", "A total of 8045 core project awards remained, of which 2002 were distributed after 2013 and excluded.", "We reviewed the remaining 6043 awards for relatedness to the development of sofosbuvir. The kappa-statistic calculation indicated reasonable agreement between reviewers for award title category (Cohen’s kappa = 0.64)", "[13].

In 1991, the first medication to treat chronic HCV was approved by the FDA, but it produced very low sustained virological response rates [17].", "During the latter half of the 1990s, other therapies for chronic HCV were approved that demonstrated improved response rates, and a process for cloning the virus was developed independently by researchers at the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) and Washington University School of Medicine that allowed in vivo study of the virus 18, 19.", "Investigators also characterized how HCV cells replicate in a specific hepatoma cell line that allowed for in vitro studies of HCV RNA replication [20].", "By the late 1990s, researchers understood more about HCV and sequenced a key protein, NS5B, that sofosbuvir would later target", "During this time, several investigators at Emory University were studying HCV and HIV, including Curt Hagedorn, Director of Hepatology at Emory from 1993 to 2003 [21].", "The related HIV work culminated in the development of emtricitabine (Emtriva), later licensed to Triangle Pharmaceuticals, and led by chemistry professor Dennis Liotta, virologist Raymond Schinazi (also affiliated with Atlanta Veteran Affairs Medical Center; University of Georgia; Georgia State University), and researcher Woo-Baeg Choi 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28.", "Both emtricitabine and what would later be discovered as sofosbuvir work through similar mechanisms, and other HCV research at different institutions began receiving federal awards during this period.", "In the years leading up to and including 1997, we identified six directly related NIH awards (US$1.8 million) and 28 indirectly related awards (US$11.4 million) (Table 1, Table 2).", "The six directly related awards went to Emory University, with either Liotta, Schinazi, or Hagedorn as investigators, between 1993 and 1997 (Table 1).", "For example, one of the awards to Emory in 1996 was titled ‘Hepatitis C—Models for Replication,’ with Hagedorn as the primary investigator, which supported research to study the viral replication of HCV and medications directly targeting the HCV RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (Table 1 and Appendix S5 in the supplemental information online).", "Of the 28 indirectly related awards, 11 went to the University of Georgia for anti-HIV research between 1993 and 1997 (US$3.5 million); eight went to Washington University studies of anti-HCV drugs and vaccines and to better understand flavivirus replication (HCV is a flavivirus) (US$3.2 million); eight went to Scripps Research Institute to understand the pathogenesis of HCV (US$4.4 million); and one went to Triangle Pharmaceuticals for nucleoside drug research (US$133 240) (Table 2).", "In 1998, Schinazi and colleagues, including Liotta, Jean-Pierre Sommodassi (of the University of Alabama at Birmingham), and Chung Chu (of the University of Georgia), founded Pharmasset, a start-up company focused in large part on developing oral drugs for HCV 29, 30, 31.", "That same year, Schinazi and Sommodassi started another drug company, called Idenix Pharmaceuticals, with similar aims to Pharmasset, likely leveraging their university experience at least in part 32, 33.", "A challenge for oral HCV drugs was their bioavailability, and the team at Pharmasset pursued prodrug formulations to enhance the utility of this approach [34].", "Other important research central to the development of the drug focused on developing an HCV cell culture system and growing the virus in vitro.", "One company, Avid Therapeutics (founded in 1994), aimed to develop assays for evaluating compounds for HBV and HCV 35, 36.", "Another start-up, Apath LLC, was founded by NIH grantee Charles Rice (Rockefeller University and Washington University) that focused on licensing technologies to pharmaceutical companies to develop products to treat HCV.", "Rice and his team were also working on developing technology to culture HCV, and were successful 37, 38, 39.", "In 2005, other teams also grew HCV in the laboratory, including researchers at the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases, Rockefeller University, Scripps Research Institute, and probably others 14, 40, 41, 42.", "Meanwhile, research was ongoing at the recently incorproated Pharmasset. During the early 2000s, the compound PSI-6130 was synthesized; controversy emerged regarding who synthesized it--whether Jeremy Clark, a researcher at Pharmasset, or other researchers at Idenix [43].", "Important derivatives emerged from it, including PSI-7851 and its diastereomer PSI-7977 44, 45. Michael Sofia is reported to have synthesized PSI-7977 in 2007, which was later named sofosbuvir based on his name [46].", "Pharmasset began animal toxicity studies of PSI-7851 in May 2008 and Phase I studies in March 2009 47, 48.", "In 2010, Pharmasset announced it would be rapidly advancing PSI-7977, initiating Phase II clinical studies, because of its favorable safety profile 31, 49.", "In 2011, Pharmasset announced the success of PSI-7977: all patients were cured of their disease, including the ten patients who had not used interferon [4].", "The company then initiated Phase III trials of PSI-7977; it was acquired by Gilead shortly thereafter in January 2012 for US$11.2 billion dollars, with 4% (US$440 million) paid directly to Schinazi 4, 31, 50, 51, 52.", "Gilead supported several additional Phase III studies and submitted a new drug application to the FDA for sofosbuvir, which was approved on December 6, 2013 [53].", "We identified 23 directly related awards made by the US federal government during this period (totaling US$5.8 million) and 82 indirectly related awards (totaling US$41.7 million) (Table 1, Table 2).", "Of the directly related awards, one went to Hagedorn at Avid Therapeutics for work to develop an HCV assay in 1998 (US$154 053), crucial because an assay would allow for further analysis of the viral lifecycle and drug development; six went to Pharmasset, with Du or Stuyver as the primary investigator, between 2003 and 2006 focusing on HCV and antiviral research (US$1.6 million); 16 awards went to Emory, with Liotta or Schinazi as the primary investigator, between 1998 and 2007, for their continued anti-HIV and HBV research (US$4.4 million) (Table 1).", "We also identified 82 indirectly related awards (US$41.7 million) that appear to have supported important research to develop novel HCV drugs at varying organizations between 1998 and2007 (Table 2).", "Nineteen awards supported Chu at the University of Georgia to continue research on anti-HIV nucleosides between 1998 and 2007 (US$8.5 million).", "Three awards funded Rice at Washington University to research antivirals and vaccines for HCV between 1998 and 2000 (US$1.3 million).", "Fifteen awards supported Rice at Rockefeller to conduct basic science research on HCV between 2000 and 2007 (US$11.2 million).", "Another 15 awards went to Rockefeller University to conduct basic science research on HCV, supporting investigators who collaborated with Rice (US$3.6 million).", "Three awards went to Apath to develop an HCV screening assay between 2000 and 2002 (US$1.1 million). Finally, 27 federal awards supported investigators at the Scripps Research Institute to conduct research on the biology of HCV (US$15.8 million).", "The discovery of the medication ultimately marketed as sofosbuvir originated in several academic centers as early as the 1990s, continued at the start-up Pharmasset, and was later commercialized by Gilead Sciences.", "During this time, we identified 29 directly related and 110 indirectly related awards from NIH that supported key milestones in the development of sofosbuvir, with a combined estimated total of at least US$60.9 million dollars of support after adjusting for inflation.", "Research during Period I (before 1998) focused heavily on virology related to HIV/AIDS, whereas research in Period II (after 1998) focused more specifically on HCV, including both understanding the disease and possible drug therapies.", "The awards we identified were crucial to the development of sofosbuvir. For example, Rice and Sofia were awarded the Lasker-DeBakey Clinical Research Award in 2016, sometimes referred to as ‘America’s Nobel Prize’, for their work in replicating HCV and developing drugs to target it, which were both key milestones in the development of sofosbuvir [54].", "Even though none of the academic researchers are listed on any of the key drug patents and neither could we identify licensing agreements or royalties received by any institution attributable to sofosbuvir specifically, publicly funded research underlay the development of sofosbuvir, as it has with other transformative drugs 2, 55, 56.", "There is a widespread belief that the pharmaceutical industry is the most important source of innovation that leads to the development of prescription drugs, a perception that is effectively disseminated by the industry and used to justify high US drug prices [57].", "A US Government investigation found that Pharmasset spent US$62.4 million (US$70 million after adjusting for inflation) developing sofosbuvir [4].", "Although most of these funds originated from early-phase private investors, the start-up also received direct support from the Federal Government.", "Six highly related awards were directed to Pharmasset between 2002 and 2006, including four R01 awards and two R43 awards [58].", "The NIH estimates that it has invested > US$1 billion dollars in small businesses (e.g., R43 awards), including Pharmasset, to commercialize research [59].", "This policy has been criticized as NIH’s ‘socialization of risk with privatization of gains’ in drug development [60].", "Precisely estimating specific federal funding remains difficult, and it is more challenging when funding amounts do not appear for related awards in the NIH RePORTER.", "One award still lists a nominal funding amount of US$1, which is clearly incorrect. To shed more light on what the Federal Government invested in Pharmasset, we submitted a Freedom of Information Act Request to the NIH about this US$1 award in 2006.", "The cover page and subsequent progress report of the award for the year in question that we recieved in response to the request indicated the award amount for that year amounted to US$338 736.", "Thus, it remains difficult to estimate NIH funding when award amounts are misstated or not readily accessible.", "Recent legislation introduced aims to improve transparency related to Government research funding, but is limited to drugs developed for Coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19)", "[62]. However, once better infrastructure is developed to adequately track Government investment, this tool could be used for other drugs.", "The amount of public and investment we identified supporting the evolution of sofosbuvir was small compared with the $11.2 billion acquisition cost that Pharmasset was paid by Gilead in 2012 (<1%), but was similar in size to the amount that Pharmasset reported investing in the development of the drug 4, 49, 50.", "This case highlights an opportunity for policymakers to consider whether a manufacturer should be obligated to consider public contributions that lead to the development of transformative drugs when establishing a price.", "Pharmasset expected the 12-week HCV treatment with sofosbuvir to cost US$36 000 in the USA, but Gilead ultimately set the price at US$84 000 per course of treatment [4].", "The pricing strategy of Gilead allowed them to recoup US$10.3 billion in sales during the first full year that sofosbuvir was on the market [4].", "Another recent proposal aims to ensure drugs developed with Federal funding are affordable and accessible by preventing companies from exclusively licensing such drugs used to treat or prevent COVID-19 63, 64.", "Although the proposal only covers drugs developed in the context of COVID-19, it could be expanded to include other drugs, such as transformative drugs or those essential to the public health.", "In the case of sofosbuvir, much of its development relied on public funding of Pharmasset, and patients and payors could have benefited from limitations on pricing of the resulting drug product.", "Finally, our estimate should be interpreted as only one component of public’s contribution to the development of sofosbuvir, although it is higher than the value identified in other reports.", "Our finding might be an underestimate in part because we focused on applied and not basic science research.", "We did not include other NIH awards related to virology generally, HCV vaccine development, and clinical trials that contributed to the improved understanding of HCV and other novel medications to treat it.", "For example, we did not consider NIH awards to Emory’s Center for AIDS research that supported the Virology Core led by Schinazi or the Drug Discovery Core led by Liotta, which received nearly US$2.5 million during the years the amounts were reported.", "This estimate also does not capture additional public spending on HCV drugs through Government-funded insurance programs [4] or tax incentives awarded to Pharmasset for the research and development costs they incurred.", "There are also other costs that patients incurred, such as copays and out-of-pocket costs, for their HCV care, which can limit access.", "Thus, considering key public funding for developing sofosbuvir plus the additional spending by payors and patients, it is evident the public is a major contributor to the development of sofosbuvir.", "There are limitations related both to the methodology used here and to data from the NIH RePORTER. First, by identifying articles through PubMed using key terms, we were only able to identify awards that resulted in a publication.", "Thus, while academics are incentivized to publish their work, researchers at start-up or spin-off companies might not have the same incentive, meaning that the costly failures in basic and translational research are not considered by this method.", "Second, the search terms selected might have unnecessarily limited the resulting articles in PubMed, which in turn would limit the awards linked through the NIH RePORTER.", "Third, the award titles and abstract provided in the NIH RePORTER were sometimes vague, making relatedness classifications difficult, or the amount of the award was not provided or was clearly mistated (e.g. as one dollar).", "Fourth, of the different agencies that provide data on awards to the NIH RePORTER, those agencies provided data during different time periods; for example, the VA, Schinazi's main employer for most of this period, provided data only from 2009 onwards, meaning that we could not account for much financial support from the VA in our estimate [10].", "Public funding had a key role in the development of sofosbuvir, with an estimated US$60.9 million federal dollars contributed to its evolution.", "Our methodology and results can contribute to the discussion about the extent to which US taxpayers are ‘paying twice’ for many transformative drugs.", "When considering that public contributions have a key role in drug development for life-saving medications, policymakers should ensure that patients and payors are able to access it at a fair and reasonable price.", "REB serves as a clinical consultant to Alosa Health for work unrelated to this publication.", "We would like to acknowledge the help of Elvira D’Andrea with the statistical calculations.

When Republicans and Democrats in Washington failed to reach a budget agreement early this year, sequestration took effect, with an 8 percent reduction in federal spending.", "A White House report issued last September projected an 8 percent cut in funding for science.", "The pharmaceutical industry is likewise going through a difficult time. The cost of drug discovery keeps rising, while many of the blockbuster drugs sustaining big pharma are about to go off patent, with few potential all-stars waiting in the wings.", "The floundering economy means less venture capital for startup biotech companies, which big pharma has recently relied on to identify drug targets and jumpstart the development of therapeutic agents.", "Pharma’s wellspring of research and development money is also beginning to slow to a trickle due to waning revenue growth, forcing the drug companies to look elsewhere for leads on drug candidates.", "Out of the search for potential fixes, academia and pharma have looked to each other’s complementary strengths, recognizing that together they have the potential for much greater research capacity.", "Schlessinger cautioned, however, that the collaboration should not be seen as a replacement for the NIH.", "Much of the cancer-related research typically supported by NIH grants, he emphasized, “do not fit the goals of the Yale-Gilead collaboration.", "The collaboration’s goals are to identify genetic changes or other molecular alterations that take place in human cancers that can be used to develop novel targeted therapies, including small molecules, therapeutic monoclonal antibodies, or biologicals that selectively block cancer cell proliferation and/or stimulate programmed cancer cell death.”", "Although the monetary perks of academia-pharma collaborations are obvious—academia gets money for health-related research and pharma has the chance to identify a blockbuster drug that stands to turn a handsome profit—there are other benefits.", "“The reason taxpayers in this country support $30 billion in biomedical research every year is because of the expectation that it is going to lead to an ability to improve human health,” says Lifton.", "However, there is a catch-22. “We have almost no ability to make new drugs and pharmaceuticals in academia.", "We rely almost entirely on that happening in the private sector.” Toward that end, he says, there needs to be a translation from basic science to clinical development of a drug.", "“I have long felt that there’s tremendous talent and depth of understanding of biology in academia, and tremendous talent and depth in chemistry in the pharmaceutical industry, and a very inefficient bridge between those two bodies of expertise that is necessary to translate basic discoveries into new therapies,” says Lifton.", "“Unless we have really effective pipelines for communication between academia and industry, we’re not going to achieve the realization of turning basic science discoveries into new treatments that are going to benefit the people who are funding the basic research—the taxpayers.”", "To facilitate new research—rapidly—the Yale-Gilead steering committee has streamlined the funding process.", "“If someone has an idea, they can bring it to the steering committee and it can be funded two or three days later,” says Lynch.", "“Even in the best scenario, the NIH funds projects nine months later from when you have your idea. So this really allows us to put resources to problems very quickly.”", "Another beauty of the Gilead partnership and others like it is that they not only foster collaboration between academia and pharma, they also encourage collaboration among different medical disciplines on the Yale campus.", "Under standard operating procedures, an individual investigator receives an R01 grant to locate one small piece of the bigger cancer puzzle.", "For example, after a geneticist identifies a mutation underlying a particular cancer, advancing that information—and securing the funding to do so—sometimes gets a bit fuzzy.", "“One of the real strengths for Yale has been the ability to build teams among clinical investigators who have access to patients and tissue samples; genomics investigators who know how to use those samples to discover genes that underlie specific forms of cancer; and biochemists and cell biologists who know how to go from specific genes and their mutations to assays to determine the consequences of the mutation that has been identified,” says Lifton.", "“It’s been really catalytic in terms of team-building across disciplines at Yale.”", "Halaban concurs. Every Thursday morning, she attends a melanoma board meeting with surgeons, pathologists, medical oncologists, radiologists, and researchers, where the discussion may turn to her Gilead-funded melanoma sequencing project.", "“To hear clinicians talking about genes, asking me, ‘What did you find out about this gene or that gene?’ is amazing,” says Halaban.", "“These things were not previously part of routine discussions. But now, the genetics of melanoma, currently mostly BRAF mutation status, changed it all.”", "Yet another advantage is that the flow of cash promotes other non-Gilead-funded research. “They’ve infused resources that we may not otherwise be able to get, both to expand Yale’s genomic capability and to build other aspects of our infrastructure,” says Patricia Pedersen, Ph.D., associate vice president for development and director of corporate and foundation relations, who played a key role in negotiating the collaboration.", "“Overall, the Gilead investment has increased our capacity, which was necessary to enable us to deliver results to them.", "In doing so, it has increased our ability to do more research, apply for more NIH grants, and get other funding.”", "Although academia-pharma collaborations create synergy through aligned interests and can be highly productive, negotiating the terms of the relationship can be difficult.", "Each stakeholder holds different core values. Academia prizes public pursuit of knowledge, research grant funding, and intellectual freedom.", "“We all have academic calendars that we live on, meaning that we want to get promoted, and for our careers to advance so that we get more grants.", "That’s why we have a never-ending desire to publish,” says Lynch.", "Both sides are working to eliminate such potential sources of conflict as restrictions on publication, problems with licensing rights, and conflict over control of the intellectual property.", "“You have to pick your partner well,” says Lynch. “It’s like a marriage. It’s really important that you select a company that fits the university.”", "“Indeed, Yale and Gilead have established strong links, productive collaboration, and common goals, and function as a harmonious couple,” Schlessinger said.", "Jaffe is an alumnus of the medical school; Gilead Sciences has previously funded faculty research projects; and the Gilead Foundation has supported a needle-exchange program and a mobile health care van in New Haven, so there is a history of camaraderie and collegiality.", "Adds Pedersen, “The company’s leadership is very academically minded.” For example, Gilead respects Yale’s mission to educate and disseminate information, placing few restrictions on the ability of Yale researchers to publish.", "“I think that Yale can feel confident based on our long-standing relationship and Gilead’s track record of social responsibility.", "We have pioneered worldwide access to our HIV drugs, signing deals with 13 different generic manufacturers in India and having a no-profit cost,” says Jaffe.", "“We’re different. The major reason is that the people who created the value are still here. We’re all scientists or M.D.s.", "The core senior management of the company has been together over 20 years.

Several topics emerged from the discussion, including resources for scientific discovery and the management of competing interests in collaborations between academia and the pharmaceutical industry.", "Keywords: Yale, health care, conference, collaboration, pharmaceutical, academic", "Recent years have marked an increased need for collaborations between pharmaceutical companies and academic investigators.", "The pharmaceutical industry, as a whole, has been afflicted with declining research and development (R&D) productivity, loss of shareholder value, and reduced profit potential [1].", "Pharmaceutical companies are failing to keep up with historical trends of productivity in drug development.", "The costs of bringing a new molecular entity (NME) to market have risen steadily over the past decade, reaching an estimated $1.8 billion per NME in 2010.", "Moreover, an increasing number of generics are being prescribed in the United States, and key drug patents are set to expire.", "It is estimated that from 2010 to 2014, patent expirations will put over $209 billion in annual drug sales at risk [2].", "Pharmaceutical companies are not the only ones under pressure. Academic investigators face declining research budgets.", "National Institutes of Health (NIH) funding is at an all-time low. Less than 20 percent of NIH grant applications are successful in obtaining funding [3,4].", "To make matters worse, in 2013, United States budget sequestration is projected to cause an additional reduction of $1.7 billion in NIH grant funding and a loss of 700 competitive research grants [5,6].", "In such troubled times, pharmaceutical companies and academic institutions are teaming up to tackle the challenges of drug development and research.", "Often with multi-million dollar contracts, these collaborations ideally benefit both parties. Pharmaceutical companies can have earlier access to novel scientific discoveries, while academia can receive additional research funding in times of dwindling grant support.", "Such collaborations are becoming more commonplace. Some examples include GlaxoSmithKline with the Immune Disease Institute in Boston, AstraZeneca with Columbia University Medical Center, and Pfizer with the University of California, San Francisco [7].", "At the 2013 Yale Healthcare Conference in April, Dr. Thomas Lynch led the discussion on partnerships between the pharmaceutical industry and academia.", "In his academic research career, Lynch has pioneered applications of EGFR mutation as a predictive marker for lung cancer treatments.", "He now serves as Physician-in-Chief at the Smilow Cancer Hospital at Yale-New Haven, acts as a consultant to several major pharmaceutical companies, and serves on the Board of Directors of Infinity Pharmaceuticals.", "Other participants of the discussion included members of pharmaceutical companies (Johnson & Johnson, Roche, Boehringer Ingelheim), academic researchers (Yale, Cornell), practicing physicians, and professional and graduate students.", "Much of the conference session centered upon the distribution and utilization of resources in partnerships between pharmaceutical companies and academic institutions.", "Funding was cited as a major resource of concern. Federal research funding has declined in recent years, and since 2011, NIH grant success rates have dipped below 20 percent.", "With the Budget Control Act of 2011, federal biomedical research spending is expected to suffer an additional decrease (“sequestration”) in 2013.", "It is estimated that this will lead to a reduction of up to $2.5 billion in the NIH budget, $0.6 billion in the NSF budget, and $0.5 billion in the CDC budget [6].", "In such times of dwindling grant support, money from pharmaceutical contracts can help assuage some of the funding woes facing academic investigators.", "Many academic institutions have established multi-million dollar research partnerships with large pharmaceutical companies, and Yale, Lynch and the conference’s home institution, is no exception.", "In 2011, Gilead Sciences and Yale School of Medicine announced a $10 million-per-year partnership. Gilead will provide $40 million in research and infrastructure support during the initial 4 years of the contract with the possibility, at the end of the initial 4-year period, to extend the partnership to $100 million over 10 years.", "In exchange, Gilead will have access to novel compounds or technologies identified by research projects funded through this partnership.", "Research projects will be selected by a joint steering committee composed of three representatives from Gilead and three representatives from Yale [8].", "Participants at the conference discussed ways of determining which projects are supported. In some collaborations, separate projects are chosen by the pharmaceutical company and academic investigators, while in others, projects are jointly decided by vote from a committee representing both parties.", "The Yale-Gilead partnership follows the latter approach, and Lynch, who serves as a member of the steering committee, described the partnership as a collaborative effort in biomedical research and lead generation.", "The tie-breaking vote on the steering committee goes to a Yale representative, Dr. Joseph Schlessinger, given the committee’s confidence in his experience and insight on lead development.", "Aside from funding, the discussion also touched upon access to compounds and human talent as resource advantages of pharma-academia collaborations.", "Pharmaceutical companies can provide their patented compounds for academic researchers to test. Not only can researchers test the efficacy of the compounds, but they can also utilize the compounds to spark new areas of investigation, such as elucidating the mechanisms of disease processes.", "However, there are also potential pitfalls. Academic investigators are often left “hand-tied” when pharmaceutical companies limit the direction of research involving company-provided compounds.", "When this happens, researchers become locked in a narrow window of study and lose the freedom to engage in the creative discovery that is an underlying hallmark of academic investigation.", "Academic investigation is not intended to replace pharmaceutical R&D. If there are directed experiments that companies would like to complete with their compounds, it would be advisable to do so through the companies’ R&D departments.", "When working with academia, pharmaceutical companies should expect to give academic researchers freedom in research, which often leads to novel discoveries.", "There is also a division of talent between the pharmaceutical companies and academia. Traditionally, the pharmaceutical industry has focused on the realm of drug development and bringing novel therapies to the public, while academia has been the leader in basic science discovery [9].", "“Talent in drug development is in pharma,” Lynch stated during the discussion, “but academia often has the best scientists for lead generation.”", "With collaboration, drug development can be faster and more efficient as academic researchers can focus on developing scientific leads and proposing novel ideas.", "Pharmaceutical researchers can then choose those leads that look most promising for further development.", "While partnerships between academia and pharmaceutical companies confer benefits to both parties, competing interests can potentially impede collaboration.", "Academia and the pharmaceutical industry tend to focus on different incentives. In pharma-academia partnerships, academia’s desire to publish often needs to be balanced against a desire by pharmaceutical companies to gain exclusive access to new technology.", "The management of intellectual property can also be a potential obstacle. Academic investigators often attach high value to novel technologies that result from their research, but from the industry perspective, academics often have unrealistic expectations of the worth of their intellectual property [10].", "Pharmaceutical companies tend to consider the high rate of attrition in drug development and are reluctant to assign excessive financial value to an early-stage scientific discovery.", "Participants at the conference discussed strategies for balancing such competing interests. For academic investigators, the timely publication of scientific studies is a high priority, and the freedom to publish must be carefully managed in any successful pharma-academia collaboration.", "In a survey by GlaxoSmithKline, half of the academic collaborators identified “restrictions imposed on publications” as a major concern of working with industry [10].", "Pharmaceutical companies are encouraged to refrain from unduly influencing the timing and content of academic publications.", "The Yale-Gilead collaboration was cited as an example in the management of competing interests. In this collaboration, Gilead requests a certain period of time after a discovery during which a study cannot be submitted for publication.", "However, after the allotted time, academic researchers are free to publish their data. Gilead also can potentially develop any intellectual property generated.", "Furthermore, it was noted during the conference, academics and pharmaceutical companies should recognize that while that their reward systems may differ, both share a common goal of improving health through biomedical research", "[11]. As much as possible, collaborations should focus on the alignment of incentives and interests. Both sides should be ready to give concessions to establish a common ground.", "Among the health care partnerships showcased during the 2013 Yale Healthcare Conference, pharma-academia partnerships were recognized as a growing and important model for facilitating the development of new treatments.", "During this time of dwindling federal research funding, collaborations between academia and pharmaceutical companies can provide a key source of financial support for academic investigators.", "Academia is often best at scientific discovery and lead generation, while pharmaceutical companies are more effective at translating discoveries into therapeutic use.", "Such domains of expertise complement one another and, when brought together in a successful working relationship, can accelerate the efficiency of drug development.", "Through panels that combine both academic and pharmaceutical representation, such as the Yale-Gilead steering committee, mutual interest can be gauged.", "Rather than having separate projects for the pharmaceutical companies and separate projects for academic purposes, it seems that interests are better aligned when the projects are mutually agreed upon.", "The pharmaceutical industry and academia often follow different incentive systems. The careful management of these incentives is crucial in establishing successful collaborations between academia and the pharmaceutical industry.", "Pharmaceutical companies are hesitant to allow the immediate publication of new discoveries because of the chance of losing their advantage in drug development.", "However, for academic researchers, publications are a crucial way to show their work and discovery. Thus to satisfy both interests, there must be concessions from both sides: a promise of future publication but also time for pharma R&D to work on drug development.", "An agreement of a strict period of time after a discovery during which there can be no publications could be made beforehand to avoid uncertainty.", "By pursuing projects of mutual interest and by making concessions based on a better understanding of each other’s incentives, pharmaceutical companies and academic institutions can engage in stable collaborations leading to more scientific discovery, faster drug development, and better health care treatments.", "- Garnier JP.

innovation system.", "We discuss the collective, cumulative and uncertain characteristics of innovation, highlighting the lack of transparency in the biomedical R&D system, the need for public investment in the innovation process, and the \"time-lag\" between risk-taking and reward.", "Despite the significant public transnational contributions to the R&D of remdesivir, the rewards are extracted by few actors and the return to the public in the form of equitable access and affordable pricing is limited.", "Beyond the necessity to treat remdesivir as a global public good, we argue that biomedical innovation needs to be viewed in the broader concept of public value to prevent the same equity issues currently seen in the COVID-19 pandemic.", "This requires the state to take a market-shaping rather than market-fixing role, thereby steering innovation, ensuring that patents do not hinder global equitable access and affordable pricing and safeguarding a global medicines supply.", "Keywords: Biomedical R&D, Innovation, Access, Public Value", "With 21.9 million confirmed coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) cases at the time of writing1 (August 18, 2020), scientists across the world are partaking in a race to identify diagnostics, treatments and vaccines for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).", "Many of these novel research initiatives

has highlighted the underlying existing health disparities within our societies, with vulnerable groups being more susceptible to becoming infected or developing severe disease and dying.5-7 Due to existing inequities in the current pharmaceutical system regarding pricing, production capacity, and health system resources, issues with equitable access to health technologies for COVID-19 inevitably arise.", "The divide in access to novel treatments, diagnostics and vaccines will be especially poignant between higher- and lower-income countries and may deepen existing health disparities within countries themselves.", "In this paper we trace back public contributions to different stages of the R&D process of Gilead Sciences’ (Gilead) remdesivir, which is currently undergoing multiple clinical trials as a promising candidate treatment for SARS-CoV-2.", "Based on the R&D of other drugs, we hypothesise that public funding and research conducted at publicly-funded research institutions (PFRIs) played an important role in driving forward remdesivir’s R&D, whereas few actors would reap the benefits.", "In order to test this hypothesis, we systematically search the pre-pandemic scientific literature on publications on remdesivir, and analyse main sponsorship of clinical trials on remdesivir to approximate the public contributions into the R&D of this therapeutic.", "We introduce the Risk-Reward Nexus8 proposed by Lazonick and Mazzucato and apply this framework to biomedical innovation, using remdesivir as a case study.", "Analysing the relationship between innovation and inequity, we discuss the collective, cumulative and uncertain characteristics of innovation.", "Furthermore, we critically appraise the actors that contributed to the innovation process and the actors that appropriate returns from the innovation.", "Beyond looking at the inequities in risk and rewards in biomedical innovation, we discuss remdesivir in the context of global health equity meaning that “everyone should have a fair opportunity to achieve their full health potential,”9 which we argue should be an integral component of biomedical innovation during this pandemic and beyond.", "We thereby seek to create a framework that is applicable to other health innovations relevant to the COVID-19 pandemic and new health technologies more generally.",

institution that receives public funds or relies on donations from the public.", "From the complete author list we calculated how many of the total affiliations fell into these three categories as well.", "In these calculations we took into account that some authors list more than one affiliation, and in such instances we weighted both affiliations equally.", "We also compiled a list of PFRI affiliations and the countries in which these PFRIs are based.", "Next, we extracted the different public funding bodies that contributed to the study from the acknowledgement section of identified

of the standard of care of the control group, as these trials do not directly study the clinical efficacy or safety of the drug.", "Our systematic search of the pre-pandemic scientific literature

For the purpose of this paper we defined PFRIs as including universities, hospitals, government agencies, research funding bodies, or any other institution that receives public funding as well as charities relying on donations from the public.", "The Collective, Cumulative and Uncertain Characteristics of Biomedical Innovation", "The Risk-Reward Nexus was first proposed by Lazonick and Mazzucato8 and considers innovation as a collective, cumulative, and uncertain process.", "Here we apply these characteristics to the R&D of remdesivir.", "As the remdesivir case study illustrates, biomedical innovation is collective, meaning it requires the skills and efforts of people from different backgrounds and often involves a network of institutions.8 These collective contributions may be in the form of knowledge (eg, information sharing), human resources (eg, scientists, clinical trial participants), infrastructure (eg, research facilities, hospitals), and financial resources (eg, governments grants).", "In 2012, Gilead-affiliated authors published the first study about the new compound GS-5734 alongside several other compounds that showed broad spectrum antiviral activity.", "In 2014, in the midst of the Ebola outbreak, a research initiative hosted by the University of Alabama at Birmingham received a large National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease (NIAID) grant to initiate safety and efficacy studies of remdesivir along other antivirals against high-priority emerging infections.26 Vanderbilt University, the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill (UNCCH) and the University of Alabama at Birmingham conducted several studies looking at remdesivir’s activity against betacoronavirae, such as the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS).15,19,25 A collaboration with the CDC and the United States Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases (USAMRIID) screened Gilead’s compound library for potential Ebola virus treatments and tested remdesivir against RNA viruses.18 Before the COVID-19 pandemic, the NIH sponsored two clinical trials in humans exploring remdesivir’s antiviral activity against Ebola.", "The larger of these was funded and sponsored by the NIAID and the NIH, and further supported by the African Coalition for Epidemic Research, Response, and Training and the government of the DRC.", "The WHO led the trial logistics, while Gilead provided the drug for comparison with other promising Ebola virus therapies.10 In this study, we identified that more than half of the authors of the pre-pandemic scientific literature were affiliated with PFRIs in 9 countries and the WHO.", "Publicly sponsored clinical trials for COVID-19 are currently underway in at least 7 countries, and involve a wide variety of actors, including (university) hospitals or health centres, universities, government agencies, and a charity.", "Thus, significant institutional support from public actors, both in terms of funding as well as logistics and research, pushed remdesivir along the development pipeline.", "The remdesivir case study highlights that biomedical innovation is cumulative, meaning that innovation that originated earlier is being used in the development of a new innovation or further developed.8 Remdesivir was originally developed as a broad spectrum antiviral,12 building on the ProTide technology developed at the University of Cardiff in the 1990s.27 It was then undergoing safety and efficacy studies against high-priority infections and found to be effective against RNA viruses, suggesting that it could be developed as a broad-spectrum antiviral against coronaviruses.19 Between 2018 and 2019, intravenous application of remdesivir was studied for Ebola in the DRC, where it was found to be adequately tolerated but less effective compared to other therapies.22 Based on this previously gained knowledge, remdesivir was first given to COVID-19 patients on a compassionate-use basis and is currently undergoing at least 24 interventional clinical trials for COVID-19 disease.28", "The remdesivir case study shows that biomedical innovation is uncertain, meaning that there is neither a guarantee that investments into R&D will actually result in innovation, nor a guaranteed return, whether financially or in the form of equitable access.8 Remdesivir’s initial development as an antiviral against hepatitis C is an example for the high-risk of early research, with many compounds not making it further than the early R&D stages.29 US government investment was necessary to identify and repurpose the compound for application in Ebola virus disease, which had limited potential for financial return for Gilead Sciences.", "After other treatments were found to be superior to remdesivir against Ebola virus disease, the compound was shelved again until COVID-19 emerged.30 Early results showed some likely clinical benefits in certain patient groups,31,32 which led the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to issue an emergency use authorization for severe COVID-19 disease.33 Multiple clinical trials are currently comparing remdesivir to placebo and other treatments.", "Dexamethasone, a cheap and widely available drug compared to remdesivir, showed to reduce mortality in hospitalised patients.34 Further clinical trials are needed to establish the effectiveness of remdesivir compared to dexamethasone and other competitors to determine whether remdesivir will become a treatment of choice for COVID-19, which highlights yet again the uncertainty of biomedical innovation.", "After focusing on the collective, cumulative and uncertain characteristics of the innovation process of remdesivir, we assess the equity aspect of the Risk-Reward Nexus, hereby applying a global health equity focus.", "We address herein the following questions: who has taken the risks, who gets the rewards, and is the degree of the rewards proportional to the risks taken?", "Who are the actors that invested labor and capital in the R&D of remdesivir? The innovative compound, GS-5734, was developed by the US-based biopharmaceutical company Gilead Sciences, applying amongst other processes and methods the ProTide technology developed at the University of Cardiff, UK, which received significant amounts of European public funding at the time.", "For the further R&D of remdesivir pre-pandemic, this study identified at least 20 different sources of public funding, including research grants, academic fellowships, and core funding from government agencies.", "The amount of funding was traceable for 6 of these 20 public funding grants, totalling nearly US$78 million, which is likely an underreporting of the total public contribution.", "The NIH and CDC were the main public funders observed in this study, supported by PFRIs and public funders from at least 3 countries.", "Additionally, the US Department of Defense collaborated with Gilead through the signing of an Other Transaction Agreement with a total contract value of nearly $50 million not captured in our findings.35,36 We recorded 24 registered clinical trials, of which 6 were sponsored by private actors and 18 by PFRIs located in at least 7 countries.", "This shows that public actors from multiple countries played a crucial role along remdesivir’s R&D pipeline, and continue to do so in the clinical trial stages.", "Our observation is supported by the findings that all 210 new molecular entities approved by the FDA between 2010 and 2016 received NIH funding.37 Furthermore, public funding played a major role in the late stage development of at least 25% of drugs approved by the FDA between 2008 and 2017.38 Overall, total biomedical R&D expenditure in 2012 amounted to US$81.8 billion in Europe and US$119.3 billion in the United States, of which the public sector directly contributed US$28.1 billion and US$48.9 billion respectively, equivalent to 30%-35% of biomedical R&D.39 Finally, the public sector is a main funder of high-risk, early research,40 making public investments especially important for priority research areas where, despite significant health need, a lack of private sector investment prevails.41", "Which actors ultimately benefit from remdesivir as a biomedical innovation? In our current biopharmaceutical system, the owner of the key patent rights (this may be the owner of a patent or a licensee) has the main control over the extraction of rewards.", "This means they hold decision power regarding pricing, production, and reimbursement agreements with governments and health systems across the world.", "The provisional patent application (61/047263) claiming the remdesivir compound formula lists two Gilead in-house scientists as co-inventors.10 In October 2015, Gilead Sciences affiliated scientists filed a patent application (62/239696) associated with remdesivir describing “Methods for Treating Arenaviridae and Coronaviridae Virus Infections.”10", "Shortly after, researchers largely affiliated with PFRIs announced the “discovery of a novel small molecule GS-5734” against Ebola virus in a Nature publication.13 A study on the impact of public grant funding on patenting by pharmaceutical and biotechnology firms has shown that NIH funding increases private-sector patenting, with every additional $10 million in NIH funding generating 2.3 additional patents owned by the private sector.42", "In March 2020, Gilead applied for “orphan status” for remdesivir in the United States, which grants significant tax credits and reduced market approval fees.", "These financial incentives were created to foster investment into rare diseases, however, COVID-19 was anything but rare at the time and after public outcry Gilead rescinded its application.43 According to estimations by researchers affiliated with PFRIs, the production price of remdesivir is merely $0.93 per day of treatment.44", "In May 2020, Gilead granted non-exclusive voluntary licenses to five generic manufacturers to distribute remdesivir to 127 countries for the duration of the pandemic.45 However, this agreement excluded 3.7 billion people and still leaves open the question how heavily affected countries not included in the list, such as Brazil, Peru, Mexico, China, and Russia can access and afford remdesivir.", "After donating the remaining stockpile of remdesivir to the US government,46 Gilead set the price for governments of developed countries at $390 per vial, or $2,340 for a 5-day treatment course, and at $520, or $3120, respectively, for US private insurance companies.47 In comparison, the Indian generic drug manufacturer Cipla Ltd priced its generic version of remdesivir at $53.34 per vial.48 The US Department of Health and Human Services secured more than 500 000 treatment courses, representing 100% of Gilead’s production in July, and 90% in August and September 2020.49 This agreement and the limited global production capacity will leave most of the world’s population without access to remdesivir, in addition to the strain on health systems caused by the high prices.", "Despite the global efforts in the R&D process highlighted above, the remdesivir case study demonstrates that rewards are extracted by few actors involved.", "Risk and Reward From a Global Health Equity Perspective", "After establishing the extent of public contributions in the R&D of remdesivir and the limited public returns, we question the proportionality of the risks and rewards of remdesivir from a global health equity perspective.", "The WHO definition of equity in health encompasses two aspects. Firstly, equity in health, or health status, means “the attainment by all citizens of the highest possible level of physical, psychological and social well-being.”50", "A large majority of the global population will not be able to access remdesivir when falling ill with COVID-19, denying them the fair opportunity to achieve their full health potential.", "The public risk taking and contributions in the innovation process, which included a significant number of patients across multiple countries (including the DRC, China, and the United Kingdom) who voluntarily risked their health by participating in clinical trials to advance science, should be reflected in the rewards, meaning global equitable and affordable access for all.", "However, as discussed above, this is currently not the case. The collective characteristic of innovation makes measuring the specific contributions of the various actors (public and private) difficult, further hindered by a lack of transparency in the biomedical R&D system.", "Private actors such as Gilead extract significantly more rewards, while incurring high costs for health systems and limiting access for patients.", "The uncertain characteristic of innovation is reflected in the need for public investment especially in early, high-risk research, and financial incentives for the private sector.", "The cumulative characteristic generates a “time-lag” between risk-taking and return, making public contributions especially at earlier stages less visible.", "Secondly, equity in healthcare means “healthcare resources are allocated according to need. ”50 This requires an understanding of who the most vulnerable people are in our global society, for instance through vulnerability mapping on national, regional and global levels,51 and the willingness to address these inequities by providing treatment to those with the greatest need first.", "Yet, in the current pharmaceutical system, ability and willingness to pay are the main definer of who will be able to realise their need.50 Despite the collective involvement of many actors, both public and private, from high-, middle- and low-income countries across the globe in the R&D of remdesivir, only privileged few patients, primarily from high-income countries with strong health systems will be able to ultimately access the treatment.", "The Risk-Reward Nexus showcases a complex involvement of public and private actors in the biomedical innovation process.", "Currently, public investment in biomedical R&D is justified as remedying market failure where the private sector is underinvesting, such as high-risk early research or research areas with limited financial return.", "However, this approach of public sector risk-taking for private sector rewards of biomedical innovation is unproportional and further increases inequities in health and healthcare.", "The COVID-19 pandemic has underlined the need for making biomedical innovation a global public good as proposed by the Lancet Commission on Investing in Health.52 Simultaneously, the Risk-Reward Nexus shows that the current definition of global public goods as non-rivalrous and non-excludable (yet, treating one person reduces the quantity available and access can be prevented53) is restrictive and does not account for the complexity and nuances of socialised public risk-taking, neither does it offer solutions for extracting public rewards.", "The public (state) thus needs to take a more pro-active market-shaping rather than market-fixing role, thereby steering innovation, ensuring that patents do not hinder global equitable access and affordable pricing, and safeguarding a global medicines supply.54 This requires biomedical innovation to be viewed in the broader concept of public value rather than global public goods to prevent similar equity issues in the future as currently seen in the COVID-19 pandemic and highlighted in the remdesivir case study.", "Further research is necessitated on the setting of priorities to address (health) inequities, the establishment of decision-making processes that are inclusive and the need for focusing on outcomes of research policies and priorities.55,56 Lastly, a framework is needed that allows for a public return which, beyond focusing on financial return, emphasises health equity through global equitable access and affordable pricing.", "Due to the explorative nature of the methods of this study, our approach towards assessing the public contributions to different parts of remdesivir’s R&D has a number of limitations.", "The restriction of the systematic literature search to the pre-pandemic literature did not capture all novel research published on remdesivir and its efficacy against coronaviruses since the COVID-19 pandemic, thereby underestimating the public contributions and risk-taking in recent months.", "By recording the clinical trials on remdesivir we tried to capture later stage research as well. Secondly, it was not possible to specify exact amounts for all public funding grants due to a lack of transparency of grant databases, and the difficulty of tracing back exact amounts even when grant numbers were listed.", "Consequently, we likely underestimated the total contribution of public funds into remdesivir’s R&D. A final limitation to our approach is that conducting a systematic literature search focusing on remdesivir failed to capture the fundamental research into molecular chemistry that led to the methods and processes by which compound GS-5734 was created and the role of public funding therein.", "An important example is the ProTide technology developed at the University of Cardiff receiving European public funding in the 1990s, which is used in the GS-5734 compound structure.27,57,58", "This case study of remdesivir discussed the collective, cumulative and uncertain characteristics of the innovation process and highlights the lack of transparency in our biomedical R&D system, the need for public investment in the innovation process, and the “time-lag” between risk-taking and reward.", "It further showed the inequity in public risk-taking and reward, resulting in rewards to few actors holding the key patent rights, while the return to the public in the form of equitable access and affordable pricing is limited.", "Beyond the necessity of treating remdesivir as a global public good, we argue that biomedical innovation needs to be viewed in the broader concept of public value creation.", "This requires further research on the setting of research priorities, the establishment of inclusive processes for decision-making and the development of a framework for public return emphasising health equity.", "Finally, with this study we aimed to create an analysis framework applicable to other health innovations relevant to the COVID-19 pandemic and new health technologies more generally.", "The authors would like to thank Dzintars Gotham, Anna Peiris, Natalie Rhodes, and Rhiannon Osborne for comments on earlier versions of the manuscript.", "The data in this study were extracted from previously published academic articles and a publicly-accessibly trial registry and therefore did not require ethical approval.", "Authors declare that they have no competing interests.", "Both authors contributed equally to the manuscript and responded to feedback and comments from colleagues.", "The authors of this paper are members of Universities Allied for Essential Medicines.

Fostering broad, affordable access was not a key consideration in the process of setting the wholesale prices.", "In the 18 months following Sovaldi’s approval, Medicare spent nearly $8.2 billion before rebates on Sovaldi and Harvoni.", "Over that same span, Medicare’s monthly spending on Hepatitis C treatments increased more than six-fold.", "In 2014 alone, Medicare and Medicaid combined to spend more than $5 billion on Sovaldi and Harvoni before rebates.", "That total is projected to climb in 2015. Gilead’s recent financial statements show U.S. sales of Sovaldi and Harvoni, including through public programs and private payers, totaled $20.6 billion after rebates in the 21 months following Sovaldi’s introduction.", "Senators Wyden and Grassley will hold a press conference today at 11:15 a.m. in the Senate Radio/TV Gallery, S-325, to discuss the investigation.", "Details are below, including a streaming feed for media unable to attend in person. Further resources are also online and additional findings from the investigation are below.", "“Gilead pursued a calculated scheme for pricing and marketing its Hepatitis C drug based on one primary goal, maximizing revenue, regardless of the human consequences.", "There was no concrete evidence in emails, meeting minutes or presentations that basic financial matters such as R&D costs or the multi-billion dollar acquisition of Pharmasset, the drug’s first developer, factored into how Gilead set the price.", "Gilead knew these prices would put treatment out of the reach of millions and cause extraordinary problems for Medicare and Medicaid, but still the company went ahead.", "If Gilead’s approach to pricing is the future of how blockbuster drugs are launched, it will cost billions and billions of dollars to treat just a fraction of patients,” Senator Wyden said.", "“America needs cures for cancer, Alzheimer’s, diabetes and HIV. If those cures are unaffordable and out of reach to millions who need them, Congress will not have met its responsibilities to the American people.", "I reject the idea that America has to choose between soaring, out-of-reach drug prices and one-size-fits-all government policies.", "Solving this challenge will take fresh, bipartisan thinking and political independence to bring people together.”", "“The Finance Committee has tremendous responsibility in overseeing the federal programs paying for prescription drug coverage,” Senator Grassley said.", "“With that responsibility, the committee should know how the costs to the public programs and private insurance companies of a single innovative drug entering the market without competition can have major effects on which patients get the new drug and when.", "This report sheds light on one example of the pricing decisions made by one company with a new prescription medicine that entered the market without competition in high demand.", "This might be an example that received the most attention in some time, but it won’t be the last. I look forward to discussions with my colleagues and the public on the policy questions in the report.", "I encourage everyone to read the report for the level of detail into pricing strategy that we don’t often see.”", "Additional major findings from the investigation include:", "- Gilead justified Sovaldi’s high price point based on price-per-cure: Documents acquired during the course of investigation illustrate that Gilead was aware it was in a position to create clear savings for payers, but chose to pursue a “regimen neutral” price justified by “cost-per-cure” calculations that resulted in greater revenue per treatment than previous direct acting anti-virals [see page 42].", "Given the increased clinical efficacy of Sovaldi, Gilead believed that it was more than justified in using the cost-per-cure pricing model [37, 46].", "- Gilead set a high price for Sovaldi with an eye toward ensuring a future high price for Harvoni: The documentation reviewed shows that Gilead considered a number of factors in determining a price point for Sovaldi, including costs for the existing standard of care for Hepatitis C treatment and setting a high baseline for the next wave of drugs, such as Harvoni", "[32-58]. In documents obtained during the course of investigation, Gilead officials noted the “value capture opportunity is in Wave 1,” and “Wave 2 access will be enhanced with a high Wave 1 price.”", "It went on to say that “[a]t any price, access for Wave 2 improves as the price for Wave 1 is increased, suggesting that Wave 1 will set a price benchmark against which Wave 2 will ultimately be evaluated.”", "By elevating the price for the new standard of care set by Sovaldi, Gilead intended to raise the price floor for all future Hepatitis C treatments, including its follow-on drugs and those of its competitors [44].", "- Gilead underestimated the degree of access restrictions that it expected would result from its pricing decision: Gilead set a price as high as it thought the market would bear before significant access restrictions would be imposed [30].", "Gilead’s analyses were ultimately incorrect on this point as many payers adopted substantial access restrictions at the final price of $84,000 [81-88, 96-98].", "- Despite significant access restrictions, Gilead refused to significantly lower the net price: When confronted with the widespread initiation of access restrictions [99-106], Gilead refused to offer substantial discounts and did not significantly modify its contracting strategy to improve patient access.", "For example, Gilead offered Medicaid programs supplemental rebates of up to 10 percent; however, its offer came with the precondition that states had to drop some or all of their access restrictions [106].", "For states already facing a steep financial burden, accepting that precondition in most cases would have increased the budgetary impact rather than easing it [107].", "Only five state Medicaid programs reached agreements with Gilead to receive supplemental rebates in 2014", "- The burdens on Medicare, Medicaid, and the Bureau of Prisons were significant: The price of Sovaldi constituted a large burden—notably among state Medicaid programs, Medicare, and the BOP—and triggered access restrictions across public and private payers, thus limiting the number of Hepatitis C-infected patients who could access the new treatment options", "[81-88, 96-98]. For example, state Medicaid programs nationwide spent $1.3 billion before rebates on the drug in 2014.", "Even with that expenditure, less than 2.4 percent of the roughly 700,000 Medicaid enrollees with Hepatitis C were treated with Sovaldi", "- Competition entered the market, prices responded, but there are still significant concerns: Three days following Viekira Pak’s approval on December 19, 2014, Express Scripts Holding Co., the nation’s largest pharmacy benefit manager, announced that it would make Viekira Pak its preferred treatment for Hepatitis C genotype 1 and would no longer cover Sovaldi and Harvoni for these patients [112].", "Gilead responded in January and February 2015 by entering into discounting agreements for Harvoni and Sovaldi with CVS, Anthem, Humana, Aetna, and UnitedHealth Group.", "Cigna struck agreements with Gilead for Harvoni only [113]. Even as competition lowered prices for therapies, this report documents that concerns remain, particularly in the public payer community, about high costs for treating millions of people in the U.S. infected with Hepatitis C, as well as the budgetary effects of a future single source innovator that might not face competition as quickly [114-122].", "A timeline of events pertaining to Gilead, Sovaldi and Harvoni is available here.", "A glossary of terms pertaining to the investigation is available here.", "Letters from state Medicaid programs are available here.", "Information on today’s press conference and a link to streaming video is below:", "Press conference on the findings of an 18-month, bipartisan investigation into the pricing of Gilead Sciences’ Hepatitis C drugs Sovaldi and Harvoni |", "- Wyden Statement on IRS Commissioner Danny Werfel’s Departure", "- Wyden Introduces Bill to End Cuba Embargo, Establish Normal Trade Relations", "- Wyden Hails Announcement of Next 15 Drugs Tapped for Medicare Negotiation", "- Wyden, Crapo, and 16 Bipartisan Senators Call on President Biden to Stop Rushing Trade Negotiations Behind Closed Doors"]}

Pearson, MD, MSc, provided the following reaction:", "“Gilead made a responsible pricing decision based on the evidence we have today. The price is largely in line with ICER’s independent assessment suggesting that a price of approximately $2,800 would be reasonable in proportion to the added benefits for patients and the cost offsets in the health system now that dexamethasone is rapidly becoming standard of care.", "But Gilead’s price appears reasonably cost-effective only under two key assumptions — that a 5-day rather than a 10-day course of treatment is used; and that patients gain a mortality benefit in addition to a shorter time to improvement.", "This mortality benefit is not an unreasonable assumption at the current time but has yet to be shown in data with statistical certainty.", "This caveat, and the need for further research to determine the true longer-term risks and benefits of remdesivir, should not be overlooked.", "There are several other key contextual factors to remember when judging Gilead’s price announcement today.", "First, Gilead has the power to price remdesivir at will in the US, and no governmental or private insurer could even entertain the idea of walking away from the negotiating table.", "Second, many Wall Street analysts were urging and citing probable figures around $5,000 per treatment course.", "Given these factors, today’s announced price can be viewed as a responsible decision from Gilead and a promising sign for pricing decisions of other treatments for COVID-19 on the horizon.", "However, some will view that in the midst of an ongoing pandemic, the price represents an unfair premium over the cost of developing the drug, particularly given the federal investment in research on remdesivir.", "Our analyses also estimated that a remdesivir price necessary to recoup Gilead’s coronavirus-specific development in the first year would be approximately $1,600.", "At today’s announced price, Gilead therefore has the opportunity to make a substantial profit on remdesivir, and some will call the amount of profit into question, whereas others will feel that a healthy profit will send needed signals to the life science industry that further investment in what may be a risky development process for additional treatments for COVID-19 is a reasonable business decision.", "We believe that three conclusions can be drawn from today’s announcement and these contextual factors.", "First, in a US health system that too often sees launch prices for new drugs scaled far beyond reasonable cost-effectiveness levels, Gilead’s pricing announcement demonstrates restraint and a promising precedent for future drug pricing during a pandemic.", "Second, the responsible pricing decision today for remdesivir must be reassessed, and the price allowed to move — up or down — based on our future learning about the drug’s effectiveness.", "If further data do not show a clear mortality benefit for remdesivir, then the price of the drug should be dramatically reduced.", "And third, the US should continue to explore alternatives to a drug pricing system that leaves the decision about the price for drugs that may mean the difference between life and death for millions of people in the hands of a single company, without competition, and whose only constraint on pricing is their own moral conscience enforced by public pressure.”", "On June 24, ICER updated its economic models for remdesivir:", "- ICER’s cost-recovery benchmark price is framed as a range with maximum of $1,600 per 10-day regimen when incorporating assumptions regarding manufacturer’s 2020 development expenses, uptake of remdesivir, and consideration of early examples of real-world generic pricing.", "- ICER’s cost-effectiveness benchmark price is a range of $4,580 to $5,080, based on new peer-reviewed data on remdesivir.", "However, a scenario analysis assuming the likely incorporation of dexamethasone as standard of care produces a lower benchmark price range for remdesivir of $2,520 to $2,800."]}

I believe we have a unique strategy in that we have both pharmaceuticals and diagnostics divisions within one company, working together to optimize the outcome,” In other words: “It’s all about getting the right drug to the right patient, in the shortest amount of time possible,” I first met Dan over the phone when he spoke to me from Basel, Switzerland, Roche’s headquarters.", "Despite the distance, he has a gift for sharing stories and experiences that make you feel like he’s in the room.", "During our conversation, he spoke with energy and warmth across a range of topics, from speeding up clinical trials, to the need for diversity in the workplace, “not just because it’s right,” but because of the creativity and divergent thinking that people from different backgrounds bring to the table.", "Born in Texas, Dan and his four siblings formed a tight-knit unit. They had to, because the family moved every couple of years, wherever their father’s job with IBM took them.", "The constant uprooting was actually a gift for young Dan, making him very adaptable to change. Today, perpetual motion seems to be built into his very essence as he works to make things better and faster in drug development.", "O’Day has never moved outside of Roche though and has been with the company since 1987.

It’s a much more logical way of approaching diseases when you can get a very good, comprehensive diagnosis at the time of onset or preferably at the preventive stage, and then allocate the right resources specifically for that patient.", "We wouldn’t want our medicines to be used when someone is not benefiting. Every medicine has a side effect, and you are essentially adding cost to the healthcare system if somebody is taking your medicine but isn’t going to benefit.", "It will be an evolution, but I have to say, in cancer care in particular, I think we are going to see this approach used much more consistently in the next five years.", "More and more cancer medicines are being approved in countries around the world that are specific to a particular patient’s genomic profile.", "We need a critical mass of these medicines to ensure that we have enough personalized options to offer to patients.", "Eventually we will reach a tipping point and this is when personalized medicine will become routine rather than just for the more fortunate patients.", "The digital world is helping to take personalized medicine to a new level because of two things: the availability of big, robust data sets that track people over a long period of time, and the application of really advanced computer capabilities.", "Advanced analytics can interrogate the data to come up with ideas for new medicines, enable us to do clinical trials faster, and eventually to help the healthcare system determine who should be treated and who shouldn’t in a constrained economic environment.", "The discovery of medicines is all trial and error, at the end of the day.

They have electronic medical records from around 1.5 million patients in the United States through their network of cancer treatment centers.", "Flatiron is able to curate reams of structured and unstructured information from those records, creating a very powerful database that shows how patients progress over time in the real-world setting.", "Even as a large company, we believe that the vast majority of innovation happens outside of our walls, so having these partnerships with entrepreneurial companies that are leaders in their fields is very important.", "It helps us to stay at the cutting edge of innovation and I find it extremely exciting.", "It starts with hiring smart people.

Yet, for all his influence in a remarkable career that spanned nearly half a century, O’Day is principally remembered for only one play.", "Granted, that one play was indeed a biggie, in what has been characterized as “the most celebrated, most widely discussed, most controversial contest in the history of American sports.”3", "O’Day was the home-plate umpire in the famous (or infamous) game in 1908 when Fred Merkle neglected to run to second base.", "Hank’s historic ruling in nullifying the apparent winning run sent a shock wave through the baseball world, turning what was already the most exciting race of all time into the most tumultuous.", "That one decision became O’Day’s legacy, defining his entire lengthy baseball career.

The O’Day brothers played under the name “Day” because their father disapproved of his sons playing the “frivolous pastime” of baseball.6", "For a while, Hank was a steamfitter’s apprentice before giving it up and traveling to faraway California to play ball for St. Mary’s College for three years.7", "At age 22, in 1883, O’Day became a professional ballplayer when he joined the Bay City, Michigan, team of the Northwestern League as pitcher and center fielder for $125 a month.", "During that season, management of the financially strapped team realized it had to reduce its roster.", "They drew his name out of a hat and he was released, despite being the team’s leading batter.8 It was an appropriate beginning for Hank’s career as a well-traveled journeyman pitcher.", "The Toledo Blue Stockings, of the same minor league, picked up O’Day.

Working full-time in the Western League was an epiphany for O’Day – this was the way baseball should and could be conducted.", "Returning to the National League as a full-time umpire in 1897, O’Day was determined to do his part to reduce the game’s excessive violence.", "It would prove to be one of his most immense contributions to baseball.29 Employing full use of all the weapons an umpire has in enforcing discipline – warnings, imposing fines, ejections, threat of forfeit, and recommending suspensions – O’Day remained resolute, sending the clear message that he would not tolerate any disrespect of the game or his authority.", "In 1897 he ejected players and managers at a steady clip, mainly for fighting and bench-jockeying. The following season he even ejected a Chicago fan for using profane language.30", "O’Day has the third highest ejection rate of any veteran umpire in major-league history.31 Hall of Fame pitcher Christy Mathewson said, “It is as dangerous to argue with him as it is to try to ascertain how much gasoline is in the tank of an automobile by sticking down the lighted end of a cigar.", "”32 Although O’Day had a high ejection rate, he was not known to have a quick trigger. Being a former player himself, he understood that in the heat of competition tempers can flare.", "He would let players blow off a little steam, as long as they didn’t go too far. “That is why I consider Hank O’Day the best in the business,” wrote F.C. Lane.", "“He makes allowances for a man. … Hank gives some leeway unless a player exceeds his bounds. ”33", "“It is most important that an umpire not lose his temper,” said O’Day. “As a matter of fact, he should not have a temper at all.", "He must not notice the little slurs.” Nonetheless, when a player cheated or engaged in acts of unsportsmanlike conduct, “I order a player from the field promptly.”34", "Stone-faced Hank O’Day, forever stoic, became known for never losing his cool. He also was recognized for never holding a grudge.", "O’Day would preach to young umpires the importance of having a short memory, to always strive to “forget all the little unpleasantness that has occurred on the field as soon as the game is over.”35", "When ejections weren’t enough to restore order, O’Day would resort to forfeit. On June 22, 1900, in Philadelphia, the losing Phillies began making a mockery of the game by purposely walking batters and refusing to tag out runners in hopes that O’Day would call the game on account of darkness and have the score revert to the earlier inning.", "After several warnings, he forfeited the game to Brooklyn and was “nearly mobbed afterwards” by the enraged hometown fans.36 A year later, on May 13, 1901, O’Day awarded another forfeit, this time against Brooklyn.", "In the top of the ninth with two outs, Brooklyn thought it had taken the lead when Bill Dahlen singled to left with the bags loaded, apparently driving in two runners.", "O’Day, however, would not allow the second run. He had noticed that the runner from second base had not crossed the plate before the runner from first had been thrown out at third base.", "It was a “time play,” meaning the second run did not count. The Brooklyn players surrounded him, screaming in protest.", "An ejection, several warnings, and O’Day pulling out his watch and waiting three minutes did not restore the peace, so he awarded a forfeit win to New York.37", "“During the formative era of major-league umpiring, no National League umpire was held in greater esteem for integrity and the ability to ‘run the game’ than O’Day,” said Professor Larry Gerlach.38", "Far too often more than a few umpires of the era would make close calls in favor of the home team to avoid abuse from the local crowd.", "O’Day refused to be intimidated and continually made the right call as he saw it, regardless of the color of the player’s uniform.", "Teams hated to see O’Day at their home games because they knew they would get no added advantage, but were delighted when he was assigned to their road games.39", "Sportswriters, accustomed to bashing officials in their game accounts, praised O’Day for having the courage to make the right call, no matter how unpopular.", "One writer called him “the premier ump of all ages. ”40 Another appreciated O’Day’s talent of having “that wonderful knack of gauging that hair-line width that separates a strike from a ball.”41", "The words integrity, honor, and honesty became synonymous with the name Hank O’Day long before they were cemented by the call that would define his life.", "On September 23, 1908, during the heat of a passionate pennant race, the Cubs and Giants were engaged in an intense game in New York’s Polo Grounds.", "The umpires were Hank O’Day behind the plate and Bob Emslie on the bases.

As the fans swarmed the field, Cubs center fielder Solly Hofman continued to run after the batted ball.", "Johnny Evers, Cubs second baseman, stood on the bag screaming for Hofman to throw him the ball. Under the rules, if Merkle was forced out at second, the run would not count.", "Hofman threw the ball off the mark into the infield, where a Cubs player picked it up. Seeing what was happening, New York’s Joe McGinnity wrested the ball from the player and threw it into a crowd of fans behind third base.", "Evers eventually got a baseball – if it was the actual game ball, nobody will ever know for sure – and stood on second base, declaring a force out.42 Cubs shortstop Joe Tinker pleaded with base umpire Emslie to call the out; but Emslie said that in the chaos he did not see if Merkle had touched second base.", "O’Day, however, was watching everything. Hank conferred with his partner, told him that Merkle did not touch second base, and Emslie called the force out.", "O’Day then nullified the “winning” run and proclaimed the game a tie. The game did not continue into extra innings because O’Day determined that by the time the grounds were cleared of fans, it would have been too dark for further play.", "The riotous mob of fans surrounding O’Day in the middle of the diamond “began pounding him on all available parts not covered by the protector, while the unfortunate attackers on the outside began sending messages by way of cushions, newspapers, and other missiles.", "”43 Police officers rushed in to rescue the umpires and escort them to the safety of their dressing room.", "National League President Harry Pulliam later denied all protests and upheld O’Day’s decision. Despite scathing editorials and extreme pressure for O’Day and Pulliam to change their decision and award the win to New York, the two remained steadfast.", "O’Day’s call was crucial because the Giants and Cubs finished the season in a dead heat with records of 98-55.", "The “Merkle Game” had to be replayed and the Cubs won, giving them the pennant by one game.", "Merkle was saddled with the nickname “Bonehead” for the rest of his life. Pulliam committed suicide by shooting a bullet into his head.", "And O’Day umpired another 17 years, abuse being heaped upon him every time he entered the Polo Grounds by fans who believed he had robbed them of a championship.", "The manner in which league presidents assigned O’Day to games is illustrative of how highly regarded he was as an umpire.", "O’Day usually worked alone but when he was a member of a two-man crew, he was generally assigned the more demanding plate position.", "In his first 1,000 games as a major-league umpire, he was behind the plate 90.4 percent of the time. A rookie umpire was often assigned to work with him so that the neophyte could learn from the master.", "When there was a particularly important series between contending teams, ones involving great pressure and large riotous crowds, O’Day was the man selected to work the games.", "As durable as O’Day was, there are several gaps in his career explained by the many illnesses and injuries he suffered while umpiring.", "There were the many bruises and beatings he sustained from irate fans charging onto the field after one of his calls.", "Foul balls were particularly treacherous: One broke his toe, requiring two players to take his place as umpire; another one smashed through his mask, producing a nasty gash on his cheek and severely injuring his jaw; and yet another inflicted a head wound requiring an operation for removal of a piece of bone from behind his ear.", "He was seriously ill one entire season with recurring stomach problems brought on by stress. In other seasons, a robust case of influenza knocked him out for several weeks and an attack of appendicitis in St. Louis meant an ambulance trip to the hospital.", "“World Series assignments clearly reveal the greatest umpires in any given era, as well as in baseball history,” wrote Larry Gerlach.44", "And Hank O’Day’s World Series record is truly astounding. When the first modern World Series was established in 1903, the two leagues were asked to send their best umpire to work the best-of-nine Series.", "The National League selected O’Day; the American League chose Tommy Connolly.

There is no doubt of that in my mind.”", "He also wrote an open letter explaining the company’s decision.", "Remdesivir’s effectiveness against Covid-19 was established in a 1,063-patient study conducted by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases.", "In results released in late April and later published in the New England Journal of Medicine, the drug reduced the median time it took a patient to recover from 15 days to 11 days with a 10 day course of treatment.", "The mortality rate in the remdesivir group was 7.1%, compared to 11.9% among those who received placebo, but the difference was not statistically significant.", "In another study in less sick patients, remdesivir led patients to improve more than placebo when it was given for five days, but not when it was given for 10.", "Following the NIAID trial, in May, the Food and Drug Administration said it would allow emergency use of remdesivir to treat patients with Covid-19.", "There will be room for outsiders to argue the price is too high — and too low. The Institute for Clinical and Economic Review (ICER), a nonprofit which sets benchmarks for what it thinks are fair prices in the U.S., said that remdesivir would be cost-effective at as much as $5,080 per treatment course.", "But it also said that, given recent studies showing that dexamethasone, a cheap and ubiquitous steroid, could save lives among ventilated patients, a fair price might be as low as $2,520.", "That would mean that governments would be getting a good deal, but perhaps not private insurers in the U.S.", "In another analysis as part of the same document, ICER said that if remdesivir does not save patients’ lives, the drug might be worth as little as $310.", "The group also said that, to recoup the manufacturers cost, the drug might need to cost anywhere from $10 to $1,600 per patient.", "O’Day said Gilead believes that remdesivir’s value is much higher than any of those numbers, arguing that just by reducing the time patients spend in the hospital the drug would save $12,000 per patient.", "“There’s no playbook for how to price a medicine in a pandemic,” O’Day said. “In normal circumstances, we’d have priced this medicine in accordance with value.", "But we’re not in normal circumstances. This is an extraordinary global situation.”", "Peter Bach, director of the Center for Health Policy and Outcomes at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, said he worries that the drug could actually lengthen some hospitalizations, because patients may not be discharged until they get a full course.", "And he said the data about the medicine may not support the price.", "“This is entirely predictable,” said Bach. “They take the highest number anybody has floated, they cut down a bit from there, and they say now they’re the good guys.", "“This is a drug that was shelved. This is a drug where the pivotal trial was funded by the U.S. government.", "And they did not go and run a trial that would have been definitive. But they’re happy to capitalize on it.”", "The price, O’Day said, was determined by finding one that would be affordable to the developed country with the lowest purchasing power, and then setting a single price for all countries.", "Why is the price for private insurers in the U.S. higher? Because, O’Day said, that is how the U.S. system works.", "“There are always two prices in the United States for a medicine,” he said.", "The Department of Health and Human Services said that it has bought 500,000 courses of remdesivir for American hospitals, which are expected to last through September.", "This represents all the doses Gilead expects to produce in July, and 90% of those expected to be produced in August and September.", "After September, a more traditional commercial distribution system for the drug will be put in place.", "Gilead expects that insurers and government programs, not patients, will shoulder most of the cost of the drug in the U.S.", "The company said government programs, including the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act, which supports uninsured patients, should support the drug’s affordability and that Gilead will provide additional assistance.", "One group that may not be happy with Gilead’s decision: investors. In a series of notes to investors, SVB Leerink analyst Geoffrey Porges recommended buying Gilead shares and said that he believed annual sales of remdesivir could reach $6.7 billion next year.", "Porges assumed prices of $5,000 per course in the U.S., $4,000 per course in Europe, and $2,000 per course in other markets.", "“I’ve never seen a disconnect between doing what’s right for patients and doing what’s right for investors,” O’Day said.", "“I believe that this is the right decision for patients and it’s the right decision for Gilead and it’s the right decision for investors.”", "But he said that, in his discussions with investors, many understood what he said is Gilead’s responsibility.", "“Many investors I spoke to encouraged us to make sure we put patients first,” O’Day said. “And so that’s what we’ve done here.”", "The company will be continuing to invest in new studies of remdesivir, which must be given intravenously.", "It is also working on a version that could be inhaled into the lungs, which will be priced separately.", "Gilead said it expects to spend $1 billion developing remdesivir by the end of this year.", "Correction: Due to incorrect information provided by Gilead to STAT, an earlier version of this story misstated that Medicaid would be eligible for remdesivir’s government price.", "To submit a correction request, please visit our Contact Us page."]}

The story is opening up and becoming The Handmaid and Company’s Tales — and it should, if it wants to continue.", "But it does mean moving away from some of what was most aesthetically interesting about those earliest episodes.", "So here we get Luke’s adventure. Which is … fine? Luke is a likable enough character, and his traveling companions are scrappy and compelling.", "By which I mean, as a person who has watched any TV show or movie before in my life, I have seen a fair number of stories about a good brave man struggling through the wilderness, with the help of an unlikely group of companions, to save his wife and child.", "It’s a good story! There’s nothing wrong with that story! But I don’t need to come to The Handmaid’s Tale to find it, and it’s never going to give me anything as shocking or sickening as, for instance, Moira and June trading wordless looks of horror at the Red Center as they realize exactly what their new role as Handmaids entails.", "Is this episode’s generic nature a bug — or a feature?", "Todd: I suppose that’s what a lot of this midsection of the season has struggled with — how do you tell a story about Handmaids while giving the audience some (completely necessary) space to take a breath and remove themselves from the world of the show?", "Episode four tried a pop music montage. Episode five tried sex. Episode six tried giving Offred a big speech.", "And this one removed us from the world of the Handmaids entirely.", "And I think I liked “The Other Side” a lot more than you. It’s probably my favorite since episode three, perhaps because it has a touch of the generic to it.", "After all, the resistance to Gilead (which apparently takes the form of a US government in hiding) would probably be a fairly standard resistance movement.", "Luke would probably move on with his life a little bit. The letter June wrote to him would probably be as short and to the point as possible.", "I also liked that the episode reframes the stakes for Luke — he’s no longer in it just to save his wife or even his country.", "He needs to get to his daughter and make sure she isn’t forced into horrifying servitude like her mother has been.", "As we’ve discussed before, June might already be too enmeshed in Gilead’s way of life, no matter how much she wishes she weren’t.", "But Hannah might still have a chance of living a full, happy life somewhere far, far away (though as we know from the situation in Mexico, Gilead’s tendrils might be spreading).", "Or maybe I’m just into the way director Floria Sigismondi uses narrow shafts of light and the gray winter sunlight of Canada to create a dystopia that feels at once familiar and still horrifying.", "I do hope we return to Offred’s perspective soon (or maybe we could check in with a character in a similar situation — like the supposedly-dead-but-c’mon-she’s-played-by-Samira-Wiley-so-she-can’t-be-dead Moira?), but I found “The Other Side” to be the best respite we’ve had from that world so far.", "Constance: I agree that this is probably the best tension relief The Handmaid’s Tale has found. We talked a little last week about how the show has struggled when it’s tried to end episodes on a cathartic note, but that final scene of Luke laugh-crying in bewildered relief over June’s note is a lovely moment, with a little edge of darkness to it: He doesn’t know, entirely, what’s being done to her, and he probably hasn’t let himself imagine anything as bad as her life actually is.", "And for once, the ironic pop song playing over the credits sort of worked.", "But the most interesting thing for me about spending an hour in Luke’s mind was getting to see how he sees June.", "His version of her is a lot less bitingly sarcastic than the version we see every week.", "In part, that’s circumstantial — she’s not being ritually raped on a monthly basis in his memories, so she has less to be biting about — but it’s also the result of sarcasm not fitting neatly into the way he wants to remember her.", "Luke sees June primarily as a mother. June in his memories is always backlit so that her hair becomes a golden halo.", "She is always murmuring sweetly to Hannah. When she turns a gun on an intruder, it’s in a protective mama bear stance.", "That same way of thinking is what led Luke to react to the news that June could no longer own property by saying, “You know I’ll always take care of you,” and then to laugh when Moira got offended.", "Luke respects and loves June, but he also objectifies her a little bit.", "He doesn’t quite think of her as a human being so much as someone to put on a pedestal, to love and cherish and protect.", "He may not be a Gileadean misogynist, but he’s still steeped in the worldview that made Gilead possible, just like anyone else.", "Todd: That’s a great reading of this episode. Luke might not be into what Gilead is all about, if only because the entire power structure of Gilead — made up of white men in natty suits with slicked-back hair as it is — wouldn’t seem to have much room for him.", "But he can’t entirely escape the objectifying impulse, because the country he grew up in is the same one that gave birth to Gilead in the first place.", "That kind of insight is, to me, why shifting the perspective in a TV show is often so vital. Knowing how Luke thinks about June doesn’t give us more insight into her — we probably could have guessed that she was fiercely protective of her daughter before this — but it does give us more insight into him and especially the world he was raised in.", "I keep thinking of Mad Men while watching this show, and I think it’s because both series, by turning to periods of more overt sexism (one imagined, the other real), force us to confront the tendrils of that sexism in our own lives.", "That’s why I was so terrified at the prospect of a Luke episode: because the temptation of an episode about him would be to turn him into a big hero.", "Instead, he escapes by accident, falls in with the resistance by accident, then mostly just hangs out.", "He’s not the hero. He’s just lucky, as so many of us are.", "But with that said, did you like his traveling companions? I was most fond of the mute (probably tongueless) former Handmaid played by Erin Way, who’s been so good on Alphas and Colony.", "Constance: I won’t lie, I would spend a rainy Saturday afternoon watching a cable movie about that scrappy band of outsiders driving their assisted living facility bus up the East Coast, dodging Gileadean forces at every turn.", "I’m looking forward to seeing more of the mute Handmaid in future episodes (great catch that they must have cut out her tongue, I hadn’t put that together), but I also enjoyed Zoe, the self-sacrificing leader who you could tell immediately would have to die, and Christine, the nun who does not give a single fuck.", "Actually, I would love an episode of The Handmaid’s Tale about nuns. Much of the rhetoric and the aesthetics surrounding the Handmaids is drawn from the rhetoric and aesthetic of nuns — the veils, the seclusion, the talk of religious sacrifice — but historically, nuns have consistently found ways of defying authority and claiming power for themselves.", "And in Gilead, nuns are on the hit list, because they are papists and that’s basically the same thing as pagan to the puritanical Sons of Jacob.", "Give me an episode about how a religious order of women thought about the rise of this religious cult centered on controlling women’s bodies.", "Todd: Constance, I think you have yourself a spinoff (just as I’ve come to wonder if The Handmaid’s Tale and Children of Men take place in a shared universe).", "What I liked best about this episode is how it shows that those words scratched into Offred’s closet — “nolite te bastardes carborundorum” — might be ironic commentary on what’s coming for Offred (in that the bastards really did grind down her predecessor), but they apply just as well to everybody living in Gilead and outside of it.", "It’s easy to feel ground down, but resistance is necessary if you’re to stay human.", "This midsection of The Handmaid’s Tale’s first season has been lumpy, but it’s convinced me, more or less, that there are more stories in this world than Offred’s.", "And that was probably the most important thing the series could do."]}

The technology also works well to replace missing proteins so we can also work in (inaudible).", "One strength of our technology is that we can produce prophylactic vaccines using a very low dose. So, for instance, the phase one rabies trial that we just completed was done at a one-microgram dose, so, in other words, a millionth of a gram dose — a very, very tiny dose.", "And so, more broadly, our company focuses — so, this year, we have four programs in phase one clinical trials, and the coronavirus program would be the fifth program in phase one.", "We expect that the phase one program for coronavirus will start at the beginning of June.", "Our technology platform is fast and it’s agile.

Thank you very much. Appreciate it.", "MR. SHIVER: Sure. I’m John Shiver. I head Vaccine Research and Development for Sanofi vaccines. Sanofi has been making vaccines for over 100 years, and we’re — for this project, we’re working with proprietary recombinant protein technology that makes the first flu vaccine that’s not in eggs that’s based on this technology.", "It has the potential to be applied very readily to coronavirus. Some early work done with SARS, the related virus, was very promising.", "We intend to leverage that work so that we can get to the clinic as soon as possible.", "Because we are a major flu vaccine producer, with this technology, we have the ability to produce large amounts of vaccine.", "We predict, dependent upon the final formulation, 100 [million] to 600 million doses per year made in New York and Pennsylvania, which is where we make most of our — about 90 percent of our flu product.", "And we can do this without jeopardizing our flu vaccine production, importantly, because we know that’s very important to maintain that.", "So, Mr. President, we’re willing to do whatever it takes to work with you and this administration. The collaboration we’ve had (inaudible) with NIH and with BARDA, who’s co-sponsoring our research to make sure that we do what we can to help with this problem.", "THE PRESIDENT: When do you think you could have the vaccine? When do you think you’d be able to have it, start producing it?", "MR. SHIVER: We’re producing it now, the experimental lot. Proteins takes a little bit longer than some of the other technologies that are more exploratory, but it’s a technology that works.", "We think we can be ready for the clinic in a year. And depending upon the nature of how the epidemic goes or doesn’t go, you know, we would — and with the help of the agencies of this country, you know, perhaps as few as several years.", "Difficult to predict, Mr. President, knowing that a vaccine has to be both safe and efficacious because it’s given to healthy people.", "DR. SCHLEIFER: Thanks, Mr. President, for having us.

We have 1,000 antibodies that are already sitting in dishes.", "We’re screening them. We’re selecting them. We anticipate, if all goes well, 200,000 doses per month can come out of our factory in New York, starting in August.", "THE PRESIDENT: That means you’d be able to use the vaccine that early?", "DR. SCHLEIFER: It depends on what we see; how we work closely with the FDA, which we will do. The FDA already reached out to us, but we’ve got to work closely.", "THE PRESIDENT: So that process would be faster than John’s?", "SECRETARY AZAR: Can you explain why that would be?", "DR. SCHLEIFER: Well, so, we make passive vac- — vaccine and therapeutic — therapeutic. Our drug will be able to protect you.", "Whether or not you’re infected, it’ll protect you from getting infected. Or if you are infected, it would treat you.", "And the — we have just taken processes that normally take years — literally, years — and we put them end-to-end and now do them in weeks to months, which nobody else in the industry can do.", "THE PRESIDENT: So this would be a combination of a vaccine and also it will — to put it in a different way — make you better, quicker.", "DR. SCHLEIFER: Yeah. Well, think of it this way: If you — if you get immunized with one of these vaccines, you’re going to make some antibodies to protect you.", "We’re going to already make those antibodies and give them to you so you don’t have to go through that whole process.", "And, as we showed with Ebola, if you give enough of them — we — it was lifesaving, life- — truly lifesaving.", "DR. SCHLEIFER: And it beat out the antivirals. It really — it was the way to go. It’s very predictable.", "I just want to say, I hope everybody succeeds here.

So (inaudible) very proud to be working with the U.S. government and to have already sent, in only 42 days from the sequence of the virus, our vaccine to Dr. Fauci’s team at the NIH.", "We’re now waiting for the vaccine to be a green light from the FDA so that the team can start dosing as soon as possible.", "What it’s very interesting about our technology is that we use messenger RNA. So, basically, it’s an information molecule that allows us to go very quickly from (inaudible) formation of a virus to having a vaccine.", "So, we already have nine vaccines in the clinic in the U.S., in Germany, and in Australia. We have five of those for respiratory diseases.", "We’ve (inaudible) with DARPA, from Department of Defense; with BARDA, from HHS. We’re having ongoing discussions.", "We were able to go so fast because we are working, for many years, with the NIH and we had worked with Dr. Fauci’s team on the MERS vaccine for the Middle East respiratory syndrome, which is a coronavirus.", "And so we’re able to move very, very fast from a few phone calls to getting a vaccine made, ready for the clinic.", "We’re now working on the phase two material, so that as soon as we get the phase one dose out of the NIH, we’ll be able to start the phase 2 right away.", "THE PRESIDENT: What is your timing then? What would you say?", "MR. BANCEL: So we’re hoping to get the phase one start very soon now. We’re just waiting for a green light.", "The product is at the NIH. And then, it will be a few months to get the human data that will allow us to pick (inaudible) dose to start the phase two right away.", "THE PRESIDENT: So you’re talking over the next few months, you think you could have a vaccine.", "DR. FAUCI: Yeah. You won’t have a vaccine. You’ll have a vaccine to go into testing.", "MR. BANCEL: The phase two would take a few months before going to phase three.", "THE PRESIDENT: All right. So you’re talking within a year —", "THE PRESIDENT: Well, but, Lenny is talking about two months, right? (Laughter.)", "DR. SCHLEIFER: A little — a little longer. A little longer.", "MR. MENICHELLA: And we would be there in June. We will be there in June if they (inaudible).", "THE PRESIDENT: A couple of months, right? I mean, I like the sound of a couple of months better, I must be honest with you.", "SECRETARY AZAR: But when you say June phase one initiation, though — right? — in June, it’s not a completed vaccine.", "MR. MENICHELLA: Well, you have a vaccine that would be ready for testing in phase one. (Inaudible) talking about a completed —", "THE PRESIDENT: Ready to use when, would you say? Ready to use. Next season?", "MR. MENICHELLA: So, assuming that the vaccine is well tolerated — it’s safe and efficacious, as John said — then I think the question is, how do we work with the FDA to expedite that as fast as possible through some sort of fast-track program to get it through phase two and three testing to get to —", "MR. MENICHELLA: So, as quickly as possible. Absolutely.", "DR. SCHLEIFER: Look, I sense the cautiousness of Dr. Fauci, and he’s right to be cautious. Because vaccines have to be tested because there’s precedence for vaccines to actually make diseases worse.", "And you really don’t want to make it — you don’t want to rush and make it — you don’t want to rush and treat a million people and find out you’re making 900,000 of them worse.", "DR. SCHLEIFER: Yeah. So that’s why I think Dr. Fauci is being a little bit cautious. I don’t want to speak for him, but — so we need to prove that.", "You know, I think that with our technology, by knowing that we have neutralizing antibodies that would give — we know that this approach worked for Ebola, we know that it worked for MERS in animals — we have a greater degree of confidence that this would work sooner, I think.", "MR. O’DAY: Yeah. Mr. President and Mr. Vice President, thank you for having us here. So I’m going to switch it up a little bit.", "We’re not a vaccine company. We’re a therapeutic company —", "MR. O’DAY: And Gilead Sciences, I know, has worked with a lot of people around the table here.", "Let me first take the opportunity to thank you for the efforts of the administration, the Secretary on the HIV elimination program, which we’re closely connected with.", "MR. O’DAY: To be able to prevent and treat this disease is just extraordinary.", "THE PRESIDENT: So we’re saying 10 years, but now we’re into 9 years, because it could have been started earlier, and somebody else didn’t start it earlier.", "And I’m now seeing — I started off saying “10 years” and now I’m down to 9 years. Do you think by the end of nine years, HIV is where?", "MR. O’DAY: I hope we can eliminate it in the developed world.", "THE PRESIDENT: But can you imagine? It will eliminated in this country.", "MR. O’DAY: I mean, because we have the ability to prevent it now, and —", "MR. O’DAY: — if you can get it to the people to really prevent it and then treat everybody, I think — it’s certainly something we’re fully committed to.", "THE PRESIDENT: If you remember back — if you remember back 10 years ago, how horrible that was, and a little beyond the 10 years.", "MR. O’DAY: I was just talking to Commissioner Hahn about it.", "THE PRESIDENT: To think about what you’ve — what’s happened. So, Daniel, let’s talk about this.", "MR. O’DAY: Absolutely. So we’re using that same antiviral experience at Gilead (inaudible) decades to now to apply it to coronavirus.", "So we have a medicine called Remdesivir, which his like a decade-long development that’s an antiviral used to treat coronavirus.", "It’s the same virus as — the same family as SARS and MERS. And we’re hoping it has the effect now against COVID-19.", "So we know, in vitro, that is has a very high effect.", "THE PRESIDENT: So you have a medicine that’s already involved with the coronaviruses.", "THE PRESIDENT: And now you have to see if it’s specifically for this.", "THE PRESIDENT: You can know that tomorrow. Can’t you?", "MR. O’DAY: So — well, we have — now, the critical thing is to do clinical trials, and we’re in the process — we have two clinical trials going on in China that were started several weeks ago, and they’re 400-patient trials each.", "They’re getting close to halfway enrolled. They’re enrolling very quickly.", "MR. O’DAY: Well, we don’t know because they’re double-bind, randomized trials. So we have to wait until the conclusion of the trial.", "Then we’ve been working with Tony and the group at NIH to have another protocol, and NIAID, that will also be a protocol that we’ll use in China, outside of China, and there in the United States to test for the virus.", "And we have two other clinical trials that we’re going to initiate next week (inaudible).", "MR. O’DAY: Yes. Yes. Well, the NIAID trial already had its first patients in Nebraska, and I think, Tony, we’re working on getting it —", "THE PRESIDENT: Would you go to Washington State where it seems to have problems?", "MR. O’DAY: Absolutely. So the intention is to begin —", "MR. O’DAY: — (inaudible) patients there in the coming days.", "MR. O’DAY: Because the trial is, really, ready to go. So we’re fully —", "THE PRESIDENT: Will you go to specifically the nursing home where they had an outbreak?", "MR. O’DAY: Yes. And the community, of course, that that touches, because all the healthcare workers of that, the family members that —", "THE PRESIDENT: When will that take place? When do you think?", "MR. O’DAY: So, literally, I think, Tony — I think it’s in the next couple of days.", "THE PRESIDENT: If Tony is involved, it’ll be tomorrow morning. Right, Tony? (Laughter.)", "MR. O’DAY: Yeah, that’s it. That’s it. But this is in collaboration — you know, we worked on the protocol together.", "Obviously, we’re providing the investigational medicine. We’re working hand in glove with many people around the table to make sure that — whether it’s FDA or CDC or NIH.", "THE PRESIDENT: So, when will you know if it works? I mean, you already have this medicine. When will you know if it works?", "MR. O’DAY: Well, I think we’ll know in the April timeframe.", "SECRETARY AZAR: And do you know — do you all, if you’re able to say, do you have any negative kick-outs, like utility analyses or DSM-V reviews or —", "MR. O’DAY: There is a DSM-V review in the trial in China. They’ll probably take a look at some of that data in March.", "So far, there’s — that would be only stopped, though, for safety reasons. You really have to wait until the end of the trial to see efficacy.", "So we’re moving as fast as we can. I think everybody around the table is probably moving as fast as we can.", "And on top of that, of course, we have to anticipate success, so we’re significantly investing our manufacturing facility and capacity.", "We’ve been working closely with the administration to make sure —", "THE PRESIDENT: You’ve already built the facility to make —", "MR. O’DAY: We have facilities that we’re re-purposing for the coronavirus.", "THE PRESIDENT: This would be tremendous news if that works.", "THE PRESIDENT: Because you’re there. I mean, you’re there. You have the plant, you have everything ready.", "MR. O’DAY: We have a trial in severe patients and in more moderate patients. And we’re trying to understand, as we all are, with epidemiology of this disease, where and when is the best place to treat.", "THE PRESIDENT: That’s very exciting. Get it done, Daniel.", "THE PRESIDENT: Don’t disappoint us, Daniel. Do you understand? Great company. Really great.", "THE PRESIDENT: Doctor, perhaps you’d like to say a few words? Please.", "DR. HAHN: Thank you, Mr. President and Mr. Vice President. It’s really an honor to be here with you. I’m really interested in hearing all the efforts that are ongoing.", "We’re working very closely now with many of you, and it’s been a great relationship.", "But we’re very interested — this is the message I want to send: We’re very interested in facilitating the development of therapeutics, diagnostics, vaccines, for the benefit of the American people.", "And we, of course, want them to be safe and efficacious, but really to look forward to working with you on this.", "THE PRESIDENT: Thank you. Great. You’re going to do a fantastic job. Thank you, Doctor.", "DR. DOLSTEN: Mr. President, Mr. Vice President, I’m chief scientist for Pfizer.", "DR. DOLSTEN: We are very pleased to be here. And, for us, it’s been always important, when there’s a major public health threats, to come together across the industry, with biotechs and federal agencies.", "We are highly appreciative of the initiative that you’re taking in this powerful way to have all of us around this table.", "Pfizer, as you know, is a proud American company. We have 170 years of experience, originally founded in Brooklyn and headquartered in New York.", "And we have brought many vaccines, therapeutics of small or large types for patients suffering from many different diseases, including infectious diseases.", "Now, specifically for the COVID-19, the coronavirus, we have identified compounds — medicines that we have that we think (inaudile) activity against very related viruses — have good, high probability to be active against COVID-19.", "And, in March, we are confirming that assumption with laboratories that have access to do this (inaudible) work of using the live virus to perform activity.", "That would allow us to work closely with Dr. Hahn here at the FDA and identify the fastest path to bring it to patients.", "That should happen, if things go well, this year. And as soon as possible, I can hear your encouragement to all of us.", "I want also to say that Pfizer has 30 — 3-0 — R&D manufacturing sites in the U.S.; more than 30,000 Americans involved in making or discovering medicines.", "And we’re willing to share our experience, our capabilities as a team here, to make sure that the public in America gets the best solutions.", "THE PRESIDENT: So do you expect to be dealing with each other a little bit? You’re competitors, but in this case, it’s different.", "This is something we want to get done very quickly. Do you expect to be sharing your own capabilities with Pfizer and everybody else?", "DR. DOLSTEN: I think the (inaudible) that have come from you makes all of us feel that we should be one team here.", "DR. DOLSTEN: And as a closing remark, we’ve had a tremendous partnership with NIH and NIAID in many areas being — pioneering to bring medicine or advances forward with CDC dialogues and with FDA here.", "So for us — we look forward to extend this relationship to make sure that Americans can, as fast as possible, given your encouragement to us, we have different options to protect them.", "Protection is by vaccines. To deal with those that are exposed, we need treatment, and those that are ill, we need treatment.", "So it’s not just one solution. I think, from this team, we should offer multiple approaches — therapeutic and vaccines — (inaudible).", "THE PRESIDENT: Do you see that happening? Because I notice you have a few different variants of what we’re talking about.", "Do you see that happening where maybe there are different either therapeutics or vaccines, or both, where you use combinations of each, maybe in different areas?", "DR. DOLSTEN: I think you are right on the frontier of science; it is about combination. And even looking at colleagues here at Gilead, we have learned that if you have two different mechanisms and put them together as treatment, the likelihood of curing, or (inaudible) responses is higher.", "THE PRESIDENT: Yeah. I love the complementary. If you can do that, I love the complementary.", "DR. DOLSTEN: You can count on our commitment here.", "THE PRESIDENT: Yeah, that’s fantastic. Thank you very much. That’s, really, very exciting.", "DR. KIM: Mr. President, Mr. Vice President, my name is Joseph Kim. I run a company called Inovio Pharmaceuticals out of Pennsylvania.", "We’re a proud American biotech company with R&D and manufacturing in California as well.", "Inovio is the leader in coronavirus vaccine development in the world. We have a phase two product for related MERS coronavirus vaccine in phase two stage.", "When the new outbreak occurred, we applied our very innovative 21st century platform called DNA medicines platform to COVID-19.", "By getting just the DNA sequence of the virus, we were able to fully construct our vaccine within three hours.", "And we’ve been working on preclinical and preparation work with the help of the FDA in acceleration and really working very well together.", "Our plan is to start the U.S.-based clinical trials for COVID-19 vaccine in April of this year; followed by, shortly thereafter, a trial in China, in South Korea.", "THE PRESIDENT: No, we can. I mean, you take — you take a look at Seattle again.", "DR. KIM: We’ve been collaborating with U.S. agencies like DARPA, NIH. We’ve collaborated with Dr. Birx in HIV vaccines many, many years ago.", "With existing resources and capacity, by end of this year, Inovio could deliver about one million doses, but to scale — by end of this year — but to scale beyond that, we need your help, Mr. President.", "We need to work with you and your agencies, BARDA, and others to help us scale our vaccine to manufacture in America, to protect American public, also to lead the world in the vaccine development from America.", "THE PRESIDENT: No, thank you very much. You’ll have our help. Thank you.", "DR. STOFFELS: Mr. President, Mr. Vice President, I’m Paul Stoffels. I’m Vice Chairman and Chief Scientific Officer for Johnson & Johnson.", "I’m in the — in vaccine research since 30 years — several drugs for HIV.", "At the moment, working with a new vaccine platform, which has been deployed — or is being deployed in HIV, in the times of Zika, as well as now in Ebola.", "We are working with Tony on a phase two and a phase three study with the HIV, with the same platform.", "With BARDA, we have extensively collaborated on an Ebola vaccine. At the moment, we are vaccinating a thousand people a day in Rwanda and in DRC, showing the safety of —", "DR. STOFFELS: And the same, actually, platform we are now deploying for corona. Since the availability of the information on the virus mid-January, we have been working day and night on getting to a vaccine.", "The first versions of that are being tested in animals, at the moment, with positive results.", "And, in parallel, the company has decided to start upscaling now. Time to result will depend on GMP manufacturing safety, (inaudible) safety — have to work closely together with the FDA on that.", "And before the year ends, hopefully in November, we have the first clinical data starting. And early next year, the results of that.", "And at the same, we are looking for significant quantity of vaccines being already produced in that timeframe.", "But you can’t do anything else than, at the moment, starting parallel — the biological clinical work and parallel doing the upscaling.", "THE PRESIDENT: So do you have different concepts and methods than, you know, Pfizer and Johnson & Johnson?", "THE PRESIDENT: Are you having different — some seem to be faster than others. And others — they do seem to be different concepts.", "DR. STOFFEL: The difference in the concept is that we are using a cold virus (inaudible), which there is a place where you can place a piece of corona, Ebola, or HIV.", "So we treat the body with another virus and generate the antibodies.", "THE PRESIDENT: And that’s different from the others?", "DR. STOFFELS: That’s different than the others. The difference is, also, it’s been used for many years now.", "It has been proven for many years that you can do it like that. And we also have a validated upscaling platform which can produce millions of doses in a very short time frame.", "And that’s a parallel process where we develop the cell line, which, if we follow what we could do with Ebola, we could produce like up to hundreds of millions of vaccines in a small, let’s say, reasonably small facility for manufacturing.", "THE PRESIDENT: So can you have it ready for next season, any of you? I mean, would you say, for the next season?", "DR. STOFFELS: That’s the goal. The next season, it should be ready.", "THE PRESIDENT: It seems to be very seasonal, right?", "DR. STOFFELS: We have to be — we have to be very careful here. If you vaccinate several hundred million people —", "DR. STOFFELS: Yeah. Doesn’t hurt. And that’s what the goal is.", "THE PRESIDENT: I agree. I agree. Thank you very much. Thank you. Great company. Thank you.", "DR. SCHUCHAT: Oh, just — Anne Schuchat from CDC. And really appreciate the chance to hear everyone.", "MR. ERCK: Mr. President, Mr. Vice President, thank you for saving the most exciting company for the last.", "(Laughter.) So we’re Novavax. We’re down the street in Maryland. We’re a vaccine company. We make the recombinant nanoparticles.", "We make respiratory vaccines. We have two in phase three trials. We have an RSV vaccine, where we vaccinated 4,600 pregnant women to protect infants from RSV disease and the youngest kids.", "We have a flu vaccine. We all know we need a better flu vaccine and we have one in phase three trials.", "We’re going to unblind in four weeks. It’s an exciting time for the company.", "But we actually — our company is focused on emerging infectious diseases. We’ve made two coronavirus vaccines.", "We made one for SARS. We made one for MERS. We tested MERS and — all the way through animal challenge trials and it showed 100 percent infection protection.", "We have an Ebola vaccine that what the NIH showed, in four different nonhuman primate studies, that we had 100 percent protection at extremely low doses.", "And we’ve made a pandemic flu vaccine for H7 and 9 and others. And we’ve twice now taken from the gene sequence to the first in human studies done in the 90 days and published it in the New England Journal.", "And we’re once again doing the same thing since the gene sequence was identified — I think it published on January 10th.", "We’ve taken the same recombinant nanoparticle platform and have been in animal studies for a couple of weeks.", "MR. ERCK: And on this — I’m sorry, on corona. Yes. And we’re going to the nonhuman primates this week with the coronavirus vaccine candidate.", "THE PRESIDENT: So what do you think in terms of timing? What do you do think?", "MR. ERCK: Timing is — what you hear around the table. As soon as we can get it to humans in the May-June timetable and in phase one study (inaudible) but we’ll have primate data.", "THE PRESIDENT: So those are unheard of speeds, I think. Right? Pretty much. We’ll make it very easy for you.", "Those are — and we have to be very safe. But those are unheard of speeds.", "MR. ERCK: No, and we’re trying to identify scale so that we can get to the billion (inaudible) scale both for — we have the vaccine antigen and adjuvant.", "And you put those together and you get the most promising result, we think. And so we desperately need and have good relationships with the FDA and to work with the FDA to see where, instead of waiting 30 days, for — to get to an IND, you get in 10 days or 21 — whatever the number is.", "But there are a lot of things that we can do with the FDA.", "And, frankly, we need money. We’re a biotech company, and not one of the larger pharma companies. And so we need money to get scale.", "THE PRESIDENT: But you work with the other companies also?", "MR. ERCK: And we have worked with the other companies and on this particular instance, we have not yet.", "THE PRESIDENT: Okay. Dr. Stephen Hahn is the new head of the FDA for those of you that don’t know. He’s one of the most respected people in the country.", "And this is man we wanted. And this is the man we got. You didn’t know you were going to be hit with this your first month, right?", "THE PRESIDENT: Been here for a couple of months and this was pretty big.", "DR. BIRX: Well, thank you. It’s a privilege to be here. Thank you, Mr. President, Mr. Vice President.", "I think what was exciting to hear around the table is you have a potential for a bridge — a bridge between the therapeutics and monoclonals, while we work on the vaccines.", "And I think that’s the most promising piece for the American people to know that there’s technology that can be used as an immediate bridge, and then as we work on the vaccines.", "So I think making sure that we’ve tested all of the antivirals that you have in your collection against this particular virus — do IC50s across the board.", "Many of you have antiviral medication. And I think just to assure the American people that we have tried using our innovators to actually screen all of the current drugs for potential activity against this virus would be key.", "But I think this is very promising with this linkage that you’ve put together in this room, between monoclonal antibodies, therapeutics, and vaccines.", "THE PRESIDENT: It is very exciting and the speed is very exciting too.", "DR. STOFFELS: I want to ask something on the screening. So we set up, already, an (inaudible) where everyone is now able to submit biotech pharmaceuticals to submit to a screening which is set up to everybody — supported by BARDA and supported by (inaudible) —", "THE PRESIDENT: That’s fantastic. They move rapidly. Media, would you like to ask any questions of any of the geniuses around the table?", "Q Mr. President, what economic stimulus measures are you considering to boost the economy as a result of the virus?", "THE PRESIDENT: Well, I guess the market is up today. Our country is very strong, economically, as you know.", "This was a — something that came out of China that was a big surprise to the world. It happened just a few weeks ago and I’m sure the Fed is looking at it; I hope the Fed is looking at it.", "They should be. But a lot of these central banks are looking at it for stimulus.", "And one thing I want to add, we keep talking about “for America,” but really, we’re looking at — for a cure for the whole world because this is a world cure, not just for the United States.", "We want to take care of the United States. But whatever we do is going to inure to the benefit of the world.", "So we want to do that. And fortunately, your — some of your companies are so large you can handle that.", "But you work together, thereby making it even better. So we appreciate that. We would love to have you work together on this, get it done, and get it done safely and quickly.", "But I think — I know we’re in very strong shape. Very strong shape, financially. And, you know, I have to tell you, I came into the room not expecting to hear quite what I’ve heard, but a lot of work has already been done.", "We’ve been encouraging them for the last few weeks. I mean, literally, from the first day when we shut it down, when we shut down the border, so to speak.", "We shut it down — China. Something we didn’t like to do, but we made a good decision.", "But we also called some of the companies around the table and said, “Get going. Just in case, get going.”", "And we’re very proud of the work that some of them have done. Some of them were very advanced already on this particular coronavirus.", "So we appreciate it. That’s tremendous news. And I think the speed is a lot greater than a lot of people would have thought.", "Q Did you see a need for federal dollars to go to some of these drug companies? I think two of the CEOs around the table mentioned the idea of federal money.", "THE PRESIDENT: Well, I don’t know. I think they’re so rich. I know the companies very well. Some of them are so rich I think they can actually loan money to the federal government.", "They don’t — (laughter) — they don’t need money. They need time. I think what they need more than anything else — Daniel, you might tell me, but I think what you need is FDA and Tony have to help you get through the process as quickly as possible, the bureaucratic stuff.", "And we don’t have bureaucrats here. We have people that really know how to get it done, between Tony and Bob and Steven.", "Q Speaking of the Fed, Mr. President, do you think that they should hold an emergency meeting before the meeting in a couple weeks to cut rates and has your — is your administration going to push for such a thing?", "THE PRESIDENT: Well, I think they should have had a meeting already. So, you know, I think they should have.", "And the central banks are going to be talking about various things tomorrow but we’ll see what happens.", "But I think they should have had a meeting already. I don’t know what takes them so long.", "THE PRESIDENT: I’ll see what happens. Let’s see what happens tomorrow.", "Q What do you say to Americans who are, you know, buying out all the hand sanitizer at CVS, who are stock- —", "Q Buying out all the hand sanitizer at CVS, who are stockpiling groceries in their basements, who are concerned about a long-term situation here?", "SECRETARY AZAR: Listen, as the President has said and we’ve said from the outset, we’re going to see more cases here in the United States and we need to be prepared.", "We need to be — we prepare for the worst case; we hope for the best case.", "Part of preparing is normal preparedness activities by individuals. Go to CDC.gov to get information about just sound preparedness at home like you would have for a hurricane or for the flu season.", "That’s the same type of activity now. So having some food, having some hand sanitizer. But, frankly, soap and water — a good soap and water handwashing for the appropriate amount of time, if you look at CDC.gov for guidance — is as effective as that kind of sanitizer.", "But people should not be panicked. They shouldn’t be — I know they may feel that. They may feel a sense of unease.", "They feel the uncertainty and we’re trying to reveal all information we have. But there are steps people could take like that — just good, everyday preparedness.", "Nothing different today than they — I would have advised six months ago to people.", "Q Mr. President, are you considering tightening any of the travel regulations that you set in motion over the weekend?", "THE PRESIDENT: Yes, we are. (Inaudible) certain countries where they have more of a breakout. We are.", "You know what those countries are; I don’t have to say it. But we are doing that and we’ve already done it, as you know, with three countries, in addition to China.", "Q You said the supplemental was near. What’s the price tag up to? And are you also considering a national emergency declaration that would allow states and local governments to tap FEMA aid?", "THE PRESIDENT: I don’t think you’ll need that because I really think we’re in, you know, extremely good shape.", "We’re prepared for anything and we could always do that at a later date if we need, it but I don’t think we need that at this stage.", "You know, interestingly, we were discussing — and a question I get asked a lot by people is, on average, you lose from 26,000 to 70,000 or so and even some cases more from the flu.", "We lose — we have deaths of that per year. Worldwide, it’s hundreds of thousands of deaths from the common flu.", "And they ask, you know, what’s the difference and how does this differ, and I guess there are things that are similar and things that are different.", "It might not be a bad question to ask. Because I get that all the time. So, so far we have six here. You have, in other countries, very — I mean, China, obviously, got hit the hardest.", "I noticed that South Korea is hit very hard. Italy is being hit very hard.", "But I — I would like to maybe know — because I — I am oftentimes asked — we average, I suspect — Tony, I think you said from around 26-, 27,000, up to 60- or 70,000 deaths per year.", "That’s a lot of deaths. And here we’re talking about a much smaller range. Now, hopefully, it stays at a much smaller range.", "Could I ask you: Any of you, if you’d like to answer that question, where would the public, what would the public think when you have so many — and that’s taken routinely.", "And I was shocked to hear this. You know, three, four weeks ago, I said, “Well, how many people die a year from the flu?”", "And, in this country, I think last year was 36- or 37,000 people. And I’m saying, “Wow, nobody knew that information.”", "Worldwide, you just multiply it out times the world, right? So what is the difference, Daniel?", "MR. O’DAY: Well, I think there are people around the table that probably are more medically qualified, but, I mean, I — clearly, what we’re representing around the table is the ability to prevent, you know, an endemic of sorts, and the ability to treat.", "And those two things going together I think are really, really important, as the (inaudible) presented.", "THE PRESIDENT: We would have to up our research on the flu — on the common flu.", "CHAIRMAN O’DAY: Well, yeah. Right. And we do have treatments for the flu, and we have vaccinations for the flu.", "And — and we need to continue to improve upon those.", "DR. DOLSTEN: Yeah. We’ve actually taken on the challenge that you just mentioned. So we are investing in what could be new technologies to completely (inaudible) the flu.", "And we need to think about how you can move fast from the first cases, to have the right type of vaccine, and how you can be able to manufacture it very fast.", "Because I — I think you’re right on the point that the numbers in flu are so large you haven’t come — that — to that level, yes.", "But I think it’s also the fear that there’s no experience here with this virus, and we don’t have the feeling of going to CVS and get the flu vaccine or use some of the earlier developed drugs.", "But I — I think you summarized it very well. These are challenges we should take on year by year in advance and protect lives.", "THE PRESIDENT: Including — including, Tony, they have to maybe — we have to step up our work on the flu because when you lose that many people, it’s something.", "DR. FAUCI: Mr. President, what we’re doing is that we have major effort in this country to develop a universal flu vaccine.", "Namely, a vaccine that you could give that would cover all the different strains so you don’t have to keep worrying about it mutating from year to year.", "DR. FAUCI: So that’s a major effort that we’re having.", "THE PRESIDENT: Because I notice every year they say a different vaccine. They have a little different, a little — and then, you know, I hear numbers that are not great: 60 percent, 70 percent coverage — success.", "And yet, I hear numbers that are better than that with respect to corona. You think you can really knock it out and that’s because you know specifically what it is, I suspect.", "DR. SCHLEIFER: I think one thing we can be sure of: We’re going to be surprised about what happens over the next couple of months.", "And we got to be prepared, as you’re trying to do —", "DR. SCHLEIFER: — for every surprise that will come at us. Because remember, maybe 100 million — I was just checking — get vaccinated for the flu, even if there’s 60 percent detection.", "We have nobody in this country vaccinated for coronavirus right now. So that, if it goes through the —", "THE PRESIDENT: But the same vaccine could not work. You take a solid flu vaccine — you don’t think that would have an impact or much of an impact on corona?", "DR. SCHLEIFER: So that’s why you have a difference. When you have a population that is totally naked to this virus, we — that’s why a vaccine approach, getting that as quickly as we can, of course, is paramount.", "And the other thing is, we have a group of people around this table, myself included, who are in an industry where optimism is an essential part of the toolkit.", "But realism is that, you know, 95 percent of what we all work on doesn’t go too far. So we — that’s why it’s so important to have so many different approaches.", "THE PRESIDENT: It seems to me, just based on what you said and also what the other folks said from great companies –companies I know very well from just seeing, you know, what they do — and I find it very interesting; I have for a long time — it would seem to me that you already know pretty much where you’re going and where you’re headed and what the answer is going to be.", "It would seem that, Steve. Doesn’t it seem — you seem to know what the answer is to this; you have to get it done.", "DR. DOLSTEN: I think some of the new technologies that have come — we heard today about the mRNA and DNA, where you use completely new tools and technologies — they give us an opportunity to move fast and that’s why some of the companies that have been working on other diseases can quickly change priorities and meet the huge public health threat.", "But I think we should take on, as a team, to do something with seasonal flu. And, actually, I think, Robert Redfield, that has been one of your key priorities and we’ve certainly picked up on that.", "THE PRESIDENT: By the way, that would be a great thing if you could do that. Just aside from this meeting, if you could do that, that would be a great thing.", "Well, I want to just thank you all very much for being here and it sounds — I’m very — it’s a very optimistic meeting.", "I didn’t realize you were that far advanced and you’ll get together if you have to. You’ll deal with Tony and Bob and you’ll deal with Stephen and get it done.", "Q Mr. President, do you — do you accept that this will take longer probably than you would like?", "THE PRESIDENT: I don’t know what the time will be. I don’t think they know what the time will be. I’ve heard very quick numbers — a matter of months — and I’ve heard pretty much a year would be an outside number.", "So I think that’s not a bad — that’s not a bad range. But if you’re talking about three to four months, in a couple of cases, and a year in other cases — wouldn’t you say, Doctor, would that be about right?", "Q Is it realistic to think, really, that a vaccine could be ready in three or four months?", "THE PRESIDENT: Well, you have the greatest companies in the world sitting around the table. I mean, Johnson & Johnson and Pfizer and all of the companies — Gilead — you have all of these great companies and that’s what they’re saying.", "DR. FAUCI: Would you — would you make sure you get the President the information that a vaccine that you make and start testing in a year is not a vaccine that’s deployable.", "So he’s asking the question, “When is it going to be deployable?” And that is going to be, at the earliest, a year to a year and a half, no matter how fast you go.", "SECRETARY AZAR: And as you said, Mr. President, treatment has got to be available before the vaccines, so that’s where you —", "THE PRESIDENT: Well, I think treatment, in many ways, might be more exciting.", "SECRETARY AZAR: Ambas- — Ambassador Birx, I think, laid out a really nice framework, as we think about managing expectations, which is be thinking antiviral therapeutics, transitioning to monoclonal antibodies and eventually to vaccines, as we think about the continuum of research and development here.", "THE PRESIDENT: Well, you know, Tony, I think that’s interesting because the concept of treatment, in a certain way, especially when you have people that are, you know, looking for treatment, they’ve already got — they’re beyond the vaccine stage, that would be very exciting.", "DR. FAUCI: And it always goes faster than vaccine, because you’re dealing with someone who is already sick —", "DR. FAUCI: So the safety issues are going to be much, much different. And you will know your result almost immediately, whereas with vaccines, it takes a long time.", "THE PRESIDENT: So — so then what would be your timing for treatment? Therapeutics, commonly known as — but I call it — what would be your number for treatment?", "DR. SCHLEIFER: For us, we can think about producing 20,000 doses by the end of the summer of a course of treatment.", "And as Dr. Fauci said, you’re going to find out very quickly. It’s not going to be a mystery, whether these things work or not.", "We’re pretty confident that a mono- — ours is the monoclonal antibody approach. We think that approach has a very high probability in the near-term of delivering.", "THE PRESIDENT: So the treatment, I mean, just for the media — so the treatment element of it goes faster than the vaccine element of it, which, in my opinion, in this case, would be better.", "MR. O’DAY: Mr. — Mr. President, I mean, the Remdesivir medicine is in phase three trials right now. And these trials are conducted very fast.", "I mean, we’re talking about 30-day endpoints. So you recruit them; you know in 30 days, you know, once you recruit, whether it works or not.", "Thankfully, so far, the drug seems to be very safe. What we have to determine is this level of efficacy — its clinical effectiveness.", "And that, as I said, we’ll know potentially as early as April —", "THE PRESIDENT: So it could be used as a treatment. Somebody is sick, they have the problem. Tony — it could be used — when do you think it could be used?", "DR. FAUCI: Well, if the trial that Daniel is talking about proves efficacy, which you likely might know in a few months whether it’s eff- — effective or not.", "DR. FAUCI: If you know by June that it’s effective, then you just scale up and manufacture it, and you’re good to go.", "THE PRESIDENT: How good is that? Hear that, Jeff? That’s good even by your standpoint, Jeff.", "SECRETARY AZAR: Let me give you an example, for instance, with the Regeneron product with Ebola. So, Tony Fauci and his team and the World Health Organization ran a historic four-arm clinical trial in the warzone in Eastern Congo.", "And two of the products — one of them developed by NIAID, one of them developed by Regeneron — proved so effective that the ethical board said stop on the other two — I’m sorry, Dan.", "MR. O’DAY: We had one of the ones that didn’t work (inaudible).", "SECRETARY AZAR: They, “And start treating.” And when I went to the Congo, I got to see people that even before FDA approval are being treated still in the extension of this clinical trial and being cured of Ebola — now walking out, where they would have had a death sentence before.", "SECRETARY AZAR: So that’s what — that’s what we would try to do.", "PARTICIPANT: So, for us, that’s an end-of-the-summer type of (inaudible).", "SECRETARY AZAR: Yeah. That’s what we would try to do.", "THE PRESIDENT: He just got back from the Congo. And that’s dedication. He was — that was not an easy trip, was it?", "PARTICIPANT: Yeah. I mean, it wasn’t easy to do that trial there, by the way. Kudos to (inaudible).", "THE PRESIDENT: Well, I want to thank everybody in this room. Mike, go ahead.", "THE VICE PRESIDENT: Yeah, just — I was about to do the same, Mr. President, and just pledge that our — our whole task force, this whole team, HHS, and the CDC — the President and I will be at NIH tomorrow.", "And I want to — I want to commend each and every one of you for responding to the President’s call for action.", "This is all hands on deck. And the news out of this meeting — that you’ve already formed a consortium.", "We know we have the greatest pharmaceutical industry in the world in the United States, Mr. President, and now we know they will be working together to create therapeutics and ultimately a new vaccine to deal with the coronavirus.", "THE PRESIDENT: And if anybody delays you, please call me. (Laughter.) And if they don’t, just call Tony and Bob.", "THE PRESIDENT: They must have heard about this meeting.", "THE PRESIDENT: No, this a very optimistic meeting. Look, I know optimism and not optimism and pess- — the worst pessimism.", "And I will tell you, the whole thing with therapeutics, to me, is very exciting. And, obviously, vaccine.", "But therapeutics is very exciting, especially when you’re so far advanced. That’s great. That’s really great.", "Thank you. Thank you very much. Say hello to everyone. Thank you everybody."]}

O’Day was named as Gilead’s CEO in December 2018, and says he is “humbled” by what the company has accomplished.", "But the journey has come with its share of criticism: of the studies Gilead chose to run, of the potential price of a desperately needed medicine, and of the way the news about the drug has been released, particularly the piecemeal way that data were made available about this trial.", "O’Day, dressed in a white shirt and tie, joined STAT on a Zoom call to answer his critics and to offer assurance.", "“We’re going to make sure that access is not an issue with this medicine,” he said, promising again and again that Gilead takes its responsibility seriously.", "A transcript of the conversation, edited for length and clarity, is below.", "Excited!

We’re excited for patients.", "So tell me, when did you find out about these NIH data?", "Oh, you know, it was over the past day or so. We’re part of the joint study team, obviously Gilead with NIH, so as the study team became informed by the data safety and monitoring board about their look at the data.", "NIH has been a great partner here. Obviously, NIH has the lead with this trial and Tony Fauci, he felt, upon seeing the results, that it was important to move quickly.", "And that’s why he moved to inform investigators yesterday evening. It all happened very quickly.", "Why issue your own news release, followed by a more detailed NIH news release? Why not a joint press release between the NIH and Gilead or two releases timed similarly?", "I think it’s just that we both have slightly different procedures. We wanted Tony to make sure that the NIH would communicate the data.", "That’s appropriate. They took the lead in this trial, even though we jointly worked together on it. And so it was up to Tony and NIH to decide when to do that, and he decided to do it during the day today.", "And we needed to alert people prior to the open of the market because of the investigator call last night.", "So we wanted to make sure there was uniformity of information.", "So, obviously, this is great news. But many people have expressed concerns about issues of corporate trust, particularly regarding the potential price of this new drug.", "What is your stance on pricing? Is this a medicine you plan to make a profit on? How will this be handled?", "Look, I think we understand the responsibility that we have as a company. That’s exactly why, as we thought through the best approach to making this drug available in the early days, we thought it was very important to move with a donation of our entire existing supply.", "First of all, it’s just the right thing to do. And secondly, it was going to facilitate access in recognition of the public health emergency and the fact that data was still developing on the medicine and regulatory processes were still underway.", "We didn’t want access to be encumbered at all in the beginning, which is why we just went for a donation right up front of 1.5 million doses.", "Bottom line is now as we approach supply, from July on, we’re going to work very closely with the government and with health care systems to make sure that it’s accessible, that it’s affordable to governments.", "We’re going to make sure that access is not an issue with this medicine.", "This is a global pandemic. There should be no question about our ability to get medicine in the hands of patients, and that’s how we’re going to approach the period of time after the donation.", "How much are you going to be able to manufacture? How much are you to be able to ramp up supply?", "I’m very proud of what the team has done since we became aware of this virus in January, both from a clinical perspective, but equally from a manufacturing perspective.", "So you know, we had around 5,000 treatment courses in January. Today we have more than 50,000 treatment courses, and that number is going to go up, as I said, 140,000 treatment courses plus between now and July.", "And then we could ramp up, to the end of the year to multiple millions of treatment courses.", "Now, the reason that I’m proud of the team is because this is a complicated chemical process. It’s many, many steps.", "Initially, in January, it took around 12 months from end-to-end to produce this product. Now, based upon the efforts of the team, really fine-tuning all the manufacturing processes, we have that down to now around six months.", "And immediately in January, when we knew there was even a possibility this medicine could be effective, long before we had any idea, even before the in vitro data came through, we made the commitment as a company to say, this is too important.", "We have to make every investment that we can in the event that this works given the human need and the societal need here.", "So we started ordering new raw materials immediately in January.", "What gets us to the 1.5 million donation of vials is that we had a certain amount of raw materials in the supply chain and we were able to order some immediately to get us to the first half of this year.", "But what allows us to go to an exponential growth in the second half of the year is the actions we took in January to make sure we ordered those long lead-time raw materials, which are just coming in now and six months from now we’ll have end products.", "So that’s why when you get into the October timeframe, the November timeframe to the December timeframe, you get this very large increase in supply.", "There have been criticisms about, in particular, the design of the SIMPLE trial, which lacked a control arm of untreated patients.", "And also the fact that both of your studies are open-label, meaning that doctors and patients know who got what treatment, though obviously, the NIAID study, the one we saw today, is not.", "Is there anything you would do differently and do you have any responses to those critics?", "It’s really important that we put this into the context of what the clinical trial program was, what the strategy was behind it.", "I think it was a very thoughtful clinical trial program.", "There were a variety of questions that had to be answered. Some have read out, we saw this morning, some are still to come.", "But this is a comprehensive clinical trial program that included immediately getting to China with a placebo-controlled study when that was the only place the virus was circulating.", "I mean the speed in which we got there to set that up as an investigator-initiated trial, combined with working with government organizations like NIH, CDC, FDA, obviously others and teeing up the second placebo-controlled trial with NIH…we knew that we needed those gold standard trials to be able to determine whether the drug was truly effective.", "And so we had basically two shots on goal in the placebo-controlled trial. And then we decided to answer some other questions purposely with non placebo-controlled trials.", "In other words, not everything had to be a placebo-controlled trial because not everything was answering the same questions.", "The SIMPLE open label trial was never designed to answer the question about comparison to a placebo. It was designed to answer the question … is five days as good as 10 days?", "We knew in a global pandemic like this, that that was a really important question to answer for patients first and foremost.", "You never want patients to take more medicine than they need to get better.", "I wanted to come back to the question you get a lot in the industry, about trust and whether people can trust you not to profiteer on the release of this drug.", "Since we’re running out of time, I’d love to have you think a little more about what you’d say to those people who feel they can’t trust Gilead, because of things that have gone on in the past related to HIV, or other issues of access.", "Well, look. I had a decision to make a little over a year ago, you know, about coming to Gilead and I was delighted that they wanted me to come.", "I couldn’t be more proud than I’ve been here this past year, learning more about what Gilead does every day to make sure that all of our medicines get the patients.", "I really mean that. I know that may sound like it’s an easy thing to say. The HIV PrEP donation program, the work we do every day with communities, disadvantaged communities in the United States and Eastern Europe and elsewhere to make sure that price isn’t a barrier to our medicines in countries around the globe.", "The work we’ve done recently with hepatitis C and working with states like Louisiana to come up with creative programs to make sure that everybody can have access to HCV medicines.", "So I see the picture very differently. Let me just say that I’m fully committed and the company is fully committed and the board’s really committed to our responsibility, again, with this pandemic medicine.", "It’s walking the talk, right? So, you know, the decision we took to say let’s donate the entirety of everything in our supply.", "Let’s make sure that if this medicine is effective, that there are no obstacles, particularly given the urgency and the plight of this pandemic around the world.", "I can assure you, Matt, and the general public, that Gilead will continue to take its responsibility very seriously here and make sure that whatever model we come up with will ensure access around the globe, and that patients are put first, and that we work with governments around the globe to make sure we have a sustainable way of supplying this medicine.", "But we understand our responsibility in this kind of pandemic.", "To submit a correction request, please visit our Contact Us page."]}

In the United States, the wealthiest nation in the world, the rollout of PrEP has been nothing short of an abysmal failure.", "Black people make up approximately 13% of the total U.S population, and about 44% of HIV diagnoses annually.1", "And despite this disparity, we are also among the smallest population of people who are prescribed PrEP.", "According to a 2019 CDC analysis, only 11.2% of all PrEP users in the U.S. were Black.2 And while more than 50% of HIV diagnoses occur in the Southern states (which is still where most Black people in America live), most of the Southern states (except for Louisiana and Arkansas) have not expanded Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act.", "A 2020 study found that states that had expanded Medicaid and had a PrEP Access Program in the state had a 99% higher PrEP use than states that had neither, leaving many of the Southern states with large Black populations and large HIV prevalence rates with low access to PrEP and corresponding low usage.3", "While many people place the blame of low PrEP use on the lack of knowledge, interest or initiative of the consumer, far less work has been done to assess the impact of the list price of the medication on the ability of users to access PrEP as well as stay on PrEP.", "Debates about drug pricing often come down to the amount a patient has to pay out of pocket when they fill a prescription.", "But high drug list prices for antiretroviral medications, including those used for prevention, still impact access to these drugs downstream, even when the patient has low or no out-of-pocket costs.", "And while patient assistance programs can help cover some of those out-of-pocket costs for people who are not insured or cannot afford the prescription co-pays, they have not been enough to increase equitable access.", "The high list prices of the initial brand name drugs for PrEP have dictated PrEP delivery systems in the U.S., including how PrEP was marketed, clinical guidelines to determine PrEP eligibility, and prior authorization requirements from payers.", "The list price of PrEP medication and its impact on the ability to scale up use to have public health benefit was described in research literature as early as 2008, four years before the drug was approved.", "A study published that year assessed the cost effectiveness of implementing a PrEP program targeting men who have sex with men in New York City.", "The model to determine cost-effectiveness used the 2007 wholesale list price of TDF/FTC, which the authors note was $31USD per pill, making the monthly supply $930USD.4 A 2011 analysis from AIDS found that the $13,416 wholesale list price of Truvada would undermine the cost effectiveness of PrEP implementation in the United States.5 And in 2012, Philpott noted the “use of antiretroviral drugs for HIV prevention can be an effective public health intervention if and only if (1) the drugs are made widely available to those at highest risk; (2) the drugs are used consistently; (3) the drugs are provided as part of a comprehensive counseling program, including frequent follow-up testing; and (4) widespread risk compensation (e.g., decreased condom use or increased numbers of sexual partners) does not occur.”6", "These four criteria for PrEP scale up have all been threatened because of the high list price of the medications.", "On May 16, 2019, Gilead Sciences CEO Daniel O’ Day testified in front of Congress on the pharmaceutical company’s reasoning for keeping the price of TDF/FTC at approximately $1800 for a 30-day supply.", "O’Day offered that despite the high cost of the medication, it did not impede access, stating, “We offer a wide range of programs to help ensure that people have access to Truvada when they need it.", "For example, 98% of people who use our copay Assistance Program have no out-of-pocket costs. In fact, according to the CDC’s own estimates when taking our programs into account, less than 1% of Americans who would benefit from PrEP are in need of financial assistance to obtain Truvada.7 Furthermore, O’Day contradicts his own testimony about the impact of the price of Truvada on patients when his written testimony also stated a major barrier to PrEP access is “Insurance benefit design that places a significant cost-sharing burden on patients.”", "In other words, according to O’Day, the price set by Gilead Sciences for PrEP is not the problem. The problem is the insurers’ cost mitigation efforts, like higher copays and out of pocket expenses for PrEP users.", "But the issue that causes the policies of insurance companies still boils down to cost, and it is the public that pays in the end.", "The idea that the public, who invested heavily in the development of TDF/FTC for both treatment and prevention through studies funded by the National Institutes of Health, is made whole through Gilead’s patient assistance programs, is unfounded.", "In order to be eligible, a patient must have a prescription, proof of income, proof of residency, be uninsured, and make no more than 500% of the federal poverty level (approx.", "$70k). If a patient applies through Gilead’s Advancing Access website, conditional approval for 30 days is usually instant (sometimes there’s a delay or denial if income or insurance status recently changed).", "If denied, a patient can fax a paper application (4 pages with supporting documents such as a month’s worth of pay stubs or insurance termination letter), in which approval is usually 48 hours or less.", "If a PrEP patient has Advancing Access but does not renew within 12 months of the designated expiration date, the patient is not eligible to apply online and, instead, must submit a paper application.", "In essence, poor and working class PrEP users who depend on Gilead’s program are made to jump through more administrative hoops to access PrEP, which may play a role in the abysmal use rates.", "Also, PrEP users are at the mercy of their providers or PrEP navigators to either alert them to these options and help them fill out the paperwork for approval.", "If a patient is not made aware of this program, then they may just not pick up the prescription.", "In addition to manufacturer assistance programs being a woefully insufficient and inefficient way to ensure access, very little attention has been paid to the ways in which the high list price of Gilead’s two brand name drugs approved for PrEP impacts payer policy, public health social marketing and education programs, and even clinical guidelines.", "Until the list price of generic TDF/FTC fell in early 2021, PrEP users on most private insurance plans were still required to go through prior authorization every month to get the prescription, which created administrative burden both on the provider and the patient.", "Often, prior authorization is used by insurers when there is more than one drug option, as a way to ensure that providers are giving a clinical reason for a patient needing a more expensive drug when a cheaper, equally effective option is available.", "And yet, for many years when TDF/FTC was the only option, patients were still forced to go through variable and arbitrary prior authorization process, with clinicians being required to document HIV risk or other clinical criteria for PrEP use.", "Many patients were also required to use mail order specialty pharmacies to access PrEP, which may not be the most convenient option for people living in places where they don’t want a medication to be mailed to their home for privacy reasons (e.g., students in campus housing or living at home with parents, etc.).", "Ultimately the high list price of the drug incentivized insurers to more tightly and narrowly restrict access as a cost containment mechanism.", "When PrEP was first being implemented, much of the focus of public health programs in major U.S. cities was to create social marketing and community education programs focused almost exclusively on promoting PrEP to gay and bisexual men.", "While gay and bisexual men, and other men who have sex with men, make up the majority of new diagnoses in the U.S., they are not the only people who are vulnerable to HIV infection.", "Cisgender women account for about 20% of HIV diagnoses in the U.S. but only make up 7% of PrEP users.8 To be sure, public health programs also prioritized targeted marketing and education programs for men who have sex with men due to the vastly higher prevalence rates among this population.", "But one question that should be explored by historians, bioethicists, and other social scientists is whether the decision to nearly exclusively market PrEP to gay and bisexual men (until there was pushback from cisgender women and transgender activists) was at least in part due to the cost of the medication itself.", "Or were the very complicated sexual risk assessments in the early clinical guidelines that made it so that many Black and Brown men and women were missed as not having enough risk factors was either consciously or unconsciously written knowing a broader population of PrEP users would stretch already grossly underfunded city, county and state HIV/STD public health programs.9", "Drug pricing has become a major issue in American politics, with Americans across the political spectrum and every walk of life agreeing that Congress should do more to control for the cost of health care and all medications.", "And as we reach the 10th anniversary of the approval of the first drug approved for PrEP, manufacturer assistance and donation programs are not a panacea for the system that has kept the cost of the medication absurdly high.", "Many studies have concluded that the disproportionately higher HIV incidence among Black communities in the U.S. does not correlate with higher incidence of sexual or drug use risk behaviors.10 Instead, higher incidence of HIV among racial and ethnic minorities with less access to adequate healthcare has created conditions where more people with HIV do not know their status and are not virally suppressed.", "Because the first clinical guidelines for PrEP eligibility were written for providers to take individual risk assessments, many Black and Brown women and men who have sex with men would not meet the bar for individual risk, while their risk for HIV acquisition based on community level viral load and other factors, greatly increased their risk.", "Luckily, several structural changes recently have helped turn the tide on some of these upstream structural barriers to PrEP access.", "The U.S. Services and Preventative Task Force A grade rating for PrEP in 201911 helped reduce or eliminate cost sharing for PrEP.", "In 2021 as generic TDF/FTC became more widely manufactured and reduced the price of a 30-day supply from $1800 for brand name PrEP down to $40 for a generic, many of these restrictive payer and clinical guideline policies have been removed.", "With generic TDF/FTC now widely available at such a low cost, pharmacies have begun allowing patients to take home a 90-day supply.", "More and more marketing and education campaigns are reaching cisgender women and transgender people. And the CDC in late 2021 relaxed its clinical guidelines for providers, essentially allowing PrEP to be prescribed to any sexually active adult who is HIV negative.12", "Drug pricing has become a major issue in American politics, with Americans across the political spectrum and every walk of life agreeing that Congress should do more to control for the cost of health care and all medications.", "And as we reach the 10th anniversary of the approval of the first drug approved for PrEP, manufacturer assistance and donation programs are not a panacea for the system that has kept the cost of the medication absurdly high.", "To suggest that the only solutions to high drug costs is to help cover the out-of-pocket cost of medications is short sighted at best, for it does nothing to address the ways in which drug price impacts the very health care system that patients access downstream — from prior authorization to whom a particular intervention is marketed to and how restrictive clinical guidelines are written.", "The community of PrEP users, activists, and providers must come together to push for changes in our ability to control prices for medications.", "Any plan to end the epidemic will fail without public policy reforms on drug pricing to adequately address the upstream the cost of PrEP medications, because the high retail price limits what public health and health care systems can do to increase utilization downstream.", "Kenyon Farrow is an HIV prevention advocate and writer in Cleveland Heights, Ohio, USA. He is the Managing Director of Organizing and Advocacy with PrEP4ALL.", "He has also been using PrEP since 2015.
